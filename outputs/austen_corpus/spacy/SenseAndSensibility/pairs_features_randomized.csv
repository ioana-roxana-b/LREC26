John Dashwood,Fanny,it was my father s last request to me that i should assist his widow and daughters,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,0,12,0,1,2,22,1,1,2,15,1,1,0,15,0,1,2,17,1,1,0,3,0,1,5,31,1,1,1,26,1,1,0,0,0,0,17,215,0,15,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it,4,2,1,1,15,7,1,1,9,7,1,1,11,8,1,1,11,3,1,1,2,0,1,0,21,5,1,1,8,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,105,53,2,21,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,4,1,1,1,9,4,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,4,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,41,26,4,9,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child,2,2,1,1,5,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,10,1,1,2,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,27,52,6,1,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,0,1,0,1,5,7,1,1,0,5,0,1,6,7,1,1,0,2,0,1,2,1,1,1,6,10,1,1,4,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,41,56,8,11,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something,2,10,1,1,3,29,1,1,2,21,1,1,3,18,1,1,1,14,1,1,0,1,0,1,6,44,1,1,4,30,1,1,0,3,0,1,44,271,10,19,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses,5,1,1,1,6,7,1,1,4,4,1,1,7,8,1,1,7,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,10,15,1,1,6,5,1,1,2,0,1,0,63,74,12,17,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase,yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them,0,3,0,1,2,7,1,1,0,7,0,1,0,10,0,1,2,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,13,1,1,0,11,0,1,0,1,0,1,14,84,14,23,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit,3,1,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,4,1,1,3,5,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,3,4,1,1,7,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,57,35,16,7,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy,8,1,1,1,17,10,1,1,6,6,1,1,9,5,1,1,3,5,1,1,1,2,1,1,15,6,1,1,11,4,1,1,0,2,0,1,104,52,18,3,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,upon my word i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,0,0,0,0,9,5,1,1,6,2,1,1,10,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,17,2,1,1,8,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,81,29,20,13,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor
John Dashwood,Fanny,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward we can ask your sisters some other year you know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them you know very much already and so does my mother and they are such favourites with harry,4,4,1,1,4,12,1,1,1,7,1,1,5,13,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,24,1,1,2,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,28,112,22,697,Fanny,M,intermediate,F,minor

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish,6,0,1,0,19,2,1,1,16,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,25,1,1,1,4,0,1,0,38,3,1,1,23,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,190,14,207,269,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister s love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence,can you indeed,5,0,1,0,13,1,1,1,12,0,1,0,5,1,1,1,16,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,25,1,1,1,16,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,135,3,217,206,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her,he comes from mr pratt s purposely to see us i will be calm i will be mistress of myself,3,0,1,0,8,4,1,1,2,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,10,5,1,1,7,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,56,20,219,916,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him,i hope not i believe not i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent,2,12,1,1,1,22,1,1,3,15,1,1,0,12,0,1,3,20,1,1,0,7,0,1,4,35,1,1,5,30,1,1,0,0,0,0,25,220,221,224,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable remember elinor how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john s hands,i confess that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other,6,2,1,1,26,2,1,1,13,4,1,1,18,1,1,1,14,2,1,1,5,0,1,0,21,4,1,1,13,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,156,33,225,218,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family,no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure,1,0,1,0,8,4,1,1,3,2,1,1,5,0,1,0,6,2,1,1,0,1,0,1,8,4,1,1,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,59,15,484,220,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,i know it is or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men,not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us,3,1,1,1,5,8,1,1,4,5,1,1,1,3,1,1,5,5,1,1,0,1,0,1,8,7,1,1,6,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,50,49,872,212,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,4,14,1,1,14,33,1,1,8,25,1,1,10,43,1,1,10,32,1,1,1,5,1,1,19,49,1,1,11,35,1,1,0,3,0,1,107,344,873,876,Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate

Marianne,Elinor,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne,3,7,1,1,4,24,1,1,2,25,1,1,0,23,0,1,2,28,1,1,0,3,0,1,2,45,1,1,1,24,1,1,0,0,0,0,22,260,92,39,Elinor; Mr. Willoughby,F,major,F,major

Marianne,Elinor,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself,the whole of his behaviour from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle,1,5,1,1,5,5,1,1,4,3,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,10,1,1,3,0,1,0,6,11,1,1,0,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,30,65,171,891,Elinor,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life,you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful,4,4,1,1,3,13,1,1,2,7,1,1,2,2,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,11,1,1,2,10,1,1,0,0,0,0,41,88,173,549,Elinor,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure,how then would you account for his behaviour,4,0,1,0,11,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,7,2,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,54,8,175,880,Elinor,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby s and,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered,2,0,1,0,8,2,1,1,4,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,9,2,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,68,14,177,276,Elinor,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,it is he it is indeed i know it is,yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her,0,7,0,1,3,26,1,1,0,17,0,1,1,17,1,1,4,21,1,1,0,8,0,1,5,39,1,1,0,25,0,1,0,0,0,0,10,235,230,710,Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,a fortnight,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy,1,14,1,1,0,40,0,1,0,22,0,1,0,23,0,1,0,23,0,1,0,7,0,1,0,56,0,1,0,36,0,1,0,3,0,1,2,331,233,712,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Marianne,Elinor,oh with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne,5,4,1,1,3,13,1,1,3,11,1,1,7,7,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,2,0,1,9,12,1,1,7,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,66,89,238,496,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,no not all we could not be more unfortunately situated,it would be impossible i know to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders,0,7,0,1,2,4,1,1,0,5,0,1,2,2,1,1,0,7,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,10,1,1,0,11,0,1,0,1,0,1,10,79,246,56,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,strange that it would what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness,whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence,0,2,0,1,1,5,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,7,1,1,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,13,46,255,561,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major

Marianne,Elinor,undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves,0,1,0,1,3,5,1,1,2,4,1,1,3,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,0,1,0,4,7,1,1,2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,26,33,275,692,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major

Marianne,Elinor,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart,2,5,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,0,7,0,1,2,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,8,8,1,1,1,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,30,59,438,98,Anne Steele; Elinor; Lady Middleton; Lucy Steele; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,major
Marianne,Elinor,has no letter been left here for me since we went out are you quite sure of it are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note how very odd,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,0,2,0,1,5,3,1,1,4,7,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,9,1,1,3,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,35,63,495,298,Elinor; Footman,F,major,F,major

Elinor,Marianne,two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end,a woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other,1,12,1,1,2,15,1,1,1,9,1,1,0,6,0,1,1,11,1,1,0,1,0,1,3,11,1,1,0,13,0,1,0,2,0,1,14,114,260,55,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major
Elinor,Marianne,i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge,mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life,2,4,1,1,4,3,1,1,10,2,1,1,9,2,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,8,4,1,1,11,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,77,41,282,173,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major
Elinor,Marianne,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours,2,0,1,0,3,3,1,1,7,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,6,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,5,1,1,8,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,63,16,298,883,Edward Ferrars; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major

Elinor,Marianne,the whole of his behaviour from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle,esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment,5,1,1,1,5,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,10,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,11,3,1,1,9,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,65,28,891,42,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major

Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed the purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world every thing was against me the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attention the very little portion of my time that i had bestowed on her in my present visit in short it ended in a total breach by one measure i might have saved myself in the height of her morality good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza that could not be and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her house the night following this affair i was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be the struggle was great but it ended too soon my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally inclined to feel and expensive society had increased i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement but whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw her miserable and left her miserable and left her hoping never to see her again,is this the real reason of your coming,19,1,1,1,30,1,1,1,26,0,1,0,18,0,1,0,34,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,65,1,1,1,36,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,364,8,839,826,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,it was necessary to my own pride i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part of what had really passed between mrs smith and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body but in this our last interview of friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted rascal i was,watched us out of the house,13,1,1,1,14,0,1,0,12,0,1,0,17,0,1,0,13,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,35,1,1,1,27,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,208,6,841,850,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,i do not know what i told her less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future i cannot think of it it won t do then came your dear mother to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent my journey to town travelling with my own horses and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward every thing so inviting when i looked back at barton the picture so soothing oh it was a blessed journey,pray be quick sir i have no time to spare,9,0,1,0,11,1,1,1,10,0,1,0,16,0,1,0,10,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,31,1,1,1,18,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,183,10,843,816,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did for i was in town the whole time what i felt is in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion my feelings were very very painful every line every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart to know that marianne was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt thunderbolts and daggers what a reproof would she have given me her taste her opinions i believe they are better known to me than my own and i am sure they are dearer,are you going back to town,9,0,1,0,14,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,8,1,1,1,6,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,19,1,1,1,11,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,119,6,847,864,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,marianne s note by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days that in spite of the many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened because time and london business and dissipation had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married but this note made me know myself better i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that i was using her infamously but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do was to avoid you both i sent no answer to marianne intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street but at last judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the house one morning and left my name,but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust,8,2,1,1,18,6,1,1,21,7,1,1,18,2,1,1,16,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,38,6,1,1,35,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,265,45,849,89,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,even so you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you how often i was on the point of falling in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long i avoided the middletons as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common not aware of their being in town however i blundered on sir john i believe the first day of his coming and the day after i had called at mrs jennings s he asked me to a party a dance at his house in the evening had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there i should have felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him the next morning brought another short note from marianne still affectionate open artless confiding everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it i tried but could not frame a sentence but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then with my head and heart full of your sister i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone oh god holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was well it does not signify it is over now such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white as death that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me it was a horrid sight yet when i thought of her to day as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world she was before me constantly before me as i travelled in the same look and hue well let me make haste and be gone your sister is certainly better certainly out of danger,my prot g as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature,33,5,1,1,37,8,1,1,31,6,1,1,37,4,1,1,31,4,1,1,8,0,1,0,79,10,1,1,60,8,1,1,3,0,1,0,497,76,851,91,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,yes yes that in particular your sister wrote to me again you know the very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the ellisons and her letter with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings it happened to catch sophia s eye before it caught mine and its size the elegance of the paper the hand writing altogether immediately gave her a suspicion some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever affecting that air of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman one loves she opened the letter directly and read its contents she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion her malice at all events it must be appeased and in short what do you think of my wife s style of letter writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not,this is not right mr willoughby remember that you are married relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear,10,0,1,0,14,2,1,1,9,2,1,1,11,1,1,1,21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,32,4,1,1,20,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,186,24,855,848,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to the original was all her own her own happy thoughts and gentle diction but what could i do we were engaged every thing in preparation the day almost fixed but i am talking like a fool preparation day in honest words her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture and after all what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends in what language my answer was couched it must have been only to one end my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance said i to myself such were my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness i copied my wife s words and parted with the last relics of marianne her three notes unluckily they were all in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence and hoarded them for ever i was forced to put them up and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me,we are assured of it,16,0,1,0,25,1,1,1,16,0,1,0,12,0,1,0,9,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,37,2,1,1,31,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,243,5,857,852,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Colonel Brandon,Elinor,i met mrs jennings in bond street and she encouraged me to come on and i was the more easily encouraged because i thought it probable that i might find you alone which i was very desirous of doing my object my wish my sole wish in desiring it i hope i believe it is is to be a means of giving comfort no i must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction lasting conviction to your sister s mind my regard for her for yourself for your mother will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard nothing but an earnest desire of being useful i think i am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong,you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could,4,0,1,0,16,3,1,1,10,3,1,1,5,2,1,1,8,4,1,1,3,0,1,0,30,5,1,1,12,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,147,17,608,601,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Colonel Brandon,Elinor,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too,upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable,83,2,1,1,129,2,1,1,96,2,1,1,86,3,1,1,134,2,1,1,16,2,1,1,224,6,1,1,164,3,1,1,6,0,1,0,1404,32,612,107,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,Colonel Brandon,the smallness of the house i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered

Elinor,Mrs. Jennings,it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution mrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister their own good nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,4,38,1,1,11,66,1,1,6,66,1,1,3,56,1,1,4,72,1,1,0,7,0,1,12,119,1,1,9,86,1,1,0,2,0,1,85,806,581,702,Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,intermediate

Elinor,Edward Ferrars,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish,6,1,1,1,12,6,1,1,3,2,1,1,6,4,1,1,11,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,16,7,1,1,10,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,91,46,922,920,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate

Edward Ferrars,Elinor,at longstaple no my mother is in town,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,0,6,0,1,1,12,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,11,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,16,1,1,2,10,1,1,0,0,0,0,8,91,918,922,Elinor; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,M,intermediate,F,major
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,quite the contrary,30,1,1,1,41,0,1,0,33,0,1,0,36,0,1,0,22,0,1,0,8,0,1,0,63,0,1,0,60,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,466,3,921,286,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,13,3,1,1,17,13,1,1,13,16,1,1,13,9,1,1,19,15,1,1,3,1,1,1,26,18,1,1,19,7,1,1,1,4,1,1,179,112,923,924,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Anne Steele,Elinor,oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one can t repeat such kind of things you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons,well it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready,21,2,1,1,53,3,1,1,89,0,1,0,48,0,1,0,85,1,1,1,13,0,1,0,105,3,1,1,74,1,1,1,9,0,1,0,682,17,735,740,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Lucy Steele,Elinor,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived,i certainly did not seek your confidence but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety,9,1,1,1,22,8,1,1,16,5,1,1,16,3,1,1,9,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,25,13,1,1,25,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,188,60,451,424,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major
Lucy Steele,Elinor,if we could be certain that it would be only for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and the idea of that for edward s sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures,she was certainly very civil to you,3,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,6,0,1,0,5,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,1,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,57,7,454,678,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major
Lucy Steele,Elinor,i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest,i confess that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence,7,0,1,0,18,1,1,1,10,3,1,1,9,1,1,1,6,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,23,3,1,1,16,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,150,20,461,384,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

John Dashwood,Elinor,not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money,i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert,8,1,1,1,13,2,1,1,4,3,1,1,10,1,1,1,9,2,1,1,3,0,1,0,19,5,1,1,11,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,130,25,652,803,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
John Dashwood,Elinor,why i hope not that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands i must have sold out to very great loss other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars s kindness is,about two hundred a year,7,1,1,1,20,0,1,0,14,0,1,0,14,1,1,1,10,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,23,0,1,0,20,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,180,5,654,793,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
John Dashwood,Elinor,another year or two may do much towards it but however there is still a great deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanny s green house and nothing but the plan of the flower garden marked out,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward,4,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,4,0,1,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,42,14,656,791,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
John Dashwood,Elinor,upon the knoll behind the house the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden will slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have a great deal to leave,but she raises none in those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far,15,0,1,0,14,0,1,0,8,2,1,1,13,4,1,1,13,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,17,4,1,1,17,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,148,21,658,663,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

John Dashwood,Elinor,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,yes he has very good property in dorsetshire,4,0,1,0,8,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,6,1,1,1,11,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,14,1,1,1,11,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,81,8,662,641,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major
John Dashwood,Elinor,why to be sure people have little have very little in their power but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin is she ill,but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent,1,6,1,1,6,16,1,1,3,12,1,1,3,11,1,1,3,18,1,1,0,4,0,1,5,15,1,1,2,17,1,1,0,0,0,0,39,137,664,797,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

John Dashwood,Elinor,very well and for the next presentation to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon he might have got i dare say fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person s death now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon s sense i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon it it is truly astonishing what could be the colonel s motive,nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which will descend to her children,13,0,1,0,20,2,1,1,10,1,1,1,14,4,1,1,14,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,13,4,1,1,10,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,162,19,794,659,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,John Dashwood,about two hundred a year,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises,1,4,1,1,0,8,0,1,0,4,0,1,1,6,1,1,0,11,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,14,0,1,0,11,0,1,0,1,0,1,5,81,793,662,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate

Elinor,John Dashwood,but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent,not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money,6,8,1,1,16,13,1,1,12,4,1,1,11,10,1,1,18,9,1,1,4,3,1,1,15,19,1,1,17,11,1,1,0,0,0,0,137,130,797,652,John Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate

John Dashwood,Mrs. Jennings,if he would only have done as well by himself as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must be out of anybody s power to assist him and there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all his mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edward s on proper conditions i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business,poor young man and what is to become of him,2,0,1,0,17,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,7,0,1,0,17,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,14,1,1,1,13,1,1,1,2,0,1,0,104,10,725,722,Elinor; Marianne; Mrs. Jennings,M,intermediate,F,intermediate

Robert Ferrars,Elinor,we may treat it as a joke but upon my soul it is a most serious business poor edward he is ruined for ever i am extremely sorry for it for i know him to be a very good hearted creature as well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world you must not judge of him miss dashwood from your slight acquaintance poor edward his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature but we are not all born you know with the same powers the same address poor fellow to see him in a circle of strangers to be sure it was pitiable enough but upon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it my mother was the first person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her that was what i said immediately i was most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected my poor mother was half frantic,have you ever seen the lady,13,1,1,1,20,1,1,1,11,0,1,0,23,1,1,1,21,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,45,1,1,1,30,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,238,6,805,806,Elinor,M,minor,F,major
Elinor,Robert Ferrars,have you ever seen the lady,yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved,1,10,1,1,1,27,1,1,0,16,0,1,1,21,1,1,0,18,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,35,1,1,0,21,0,1,0,2,0,1,6,220,806,807,Robert Ferrars,F,major,M,minor
