p00008_A,00008,A,she said in the most natural way she offered me a lozenge when the dust irritated my throat
p00009_A,00009,A,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00010_A,00010,A,aunt they live most comfortably with my wife s mother where she was living when she died i can see them whenever i like they are such very very small children
p00011_A,00011,A,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do

p00022_A,00022,A,wanting to see indians how new that sounds natives why fancy
p00023_A,00023,A,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00024_A,00024,A,even from one s patients
p00025_A,00025,A,how if he went to heaven
p00026_A,00026,A,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00027_A,00027,A,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00028_A,00028,A,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00029_A,00029,A,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00030_A,00030,A,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening

p00065_A,00065,A,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p00066_A,00066,A,we english do
p00067_A,00067,A,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00068_A,00068,A,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p00069_A,00069,A,well

p00107_A,00107,A,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p00108_A,00108,A,you give me five minutes time i ll take you any dam anywhere

p00117_A,00117,A,i say adela what was it
p00118_A,00118,A,i don t know the animals any better than the birds here too big for a goat
p00119_A,00119,A,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p00120_A,00120,A,half a mo ment give me ten minutes time
p00121_A,00121,A,can you give us a lift
p00122_A,00122,A,yes indeed

p00125_A,00125,A,i will sit in front
p00126_A,00126,A,then hop in i ve no notion who you are
p00127_A,00127,A,heh no what about my dinner i can t be left alone all the night
p00128_A,00128,A,nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle i shall despatch him with all possible speed meanwhile repair my car
p00129_A,00129,A,really i had no idea
p00130_A,00130,A,i understand those big people are not particularly interesting
p00131_A,00131,A,i would scarcely call her wrong a native state a hindu state the wife of a ruler of a hindu state may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady and let it not be for a moment supposed that i suggest anything against the character of her highness the maharani of mudkul but i fear she will be uneducated i fear she will be superstitious indeed how could she be otherwise what opportunity of education has such a lady had oh superstition is terrible terrible oh it is the great defect in our indian character oh it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off and though i have little experience of hindu states and none of this particular one namely mudkul the ruler i fancy has a salute of but eleven guns yet i cannot imagine that they have been as successful as british india where we see reason and orderliness spreading in every direction like a most health giving flood
p00132_A,00132,A,golly
p00133_A,00133,A,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p00134_A,00134,A,look here both of you see india if you like and as you like i know i made myself rather ridiculous at fielding s but it s different now i wasn t quite sure of myself
p00135_A,00135,A,have i really
p00136_A,00136,A,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00137_A,00137,A,what animal
p00138_A,00138,A,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00139_A,00139,A,if i had been killed what matter it must happen sometime but they who trusted me you know nureddin you know my dear fellow we moslems simply must get rid of these superstitions or india will never advance how long must i hear of the savage pig upon the marabar road your grandfather belongs to another generation and i respect and love the old gentleman as you know i say nothing against him only that it is wrong for us because we are young i want you to promise me nureddin are you listening not to believe in evil spirits and if i die for my health grows very weak to bring up my three children to disbelieve in them too
p00140_A,00140,A,aziz my dear fellow we are greatly concerned
p00141_A,00141,A,when an engineer falls ill it is equally important
p00142_A,00142,A,oh yes we are all jolly important our salaries prove it
p00143_A,00143,A,humbug
p00144_A,00144,A,humbug most certainly
p00145_A,00145,A,is professor godbole ill i am sincerely sorry how do you do mr syed mohammed mr haq how very kind of you to enquire after my health how do you do hamidullah but you bring me bad news what is wrong with him the excellent fellow
p00146_A,00146,A,yes rafi s the great man rafi is the sherlock holmes of chandrapore speak up rafi
p00147_A,00147,A,oh yes indeed sir and the serious pains
p00148_A,00148,A,that settles it in twenty four hours he will be dead
p00149_A,00149,A,that is exactly my own view
p00150_A,00150,A,aziz aziz my dear boy we must be going we are already late get well quickly for i do not know what our little circle would do without you
p00151_A,00151,A,add mine to them
p00152_A,00152,A,thank you mr syed mohammed i will
p00153_A,00153,A,and sir accept mine
p00154_A,00154,A,here he lies
p00155_A,00155,A,i think not much
p00156_A,00156,A,and how much illness there is in the city
p00157_A,00157,A,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p00158_A,00158,A,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p00159_A,00159,A,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p00160_A,00160,A,and so much my dear rafi for your cholera
p00161_A,00161,A,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p00162_A,00162,A,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p00163_A,00163,A,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p00164_A,00164,A,it is only a boy
p00165_A,00165,A,nor you the advantage of conducting their cases in the courts any longer
p00166_A,00166,A,i say is he ill or isn t he ill
p00167_A,00167,A,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p00168_A,00168,A,don t talk to him like that he doesn t want it and he doesn t want three chairs he s not three englishmen rafi come here sit down again i m delighted you could come with mr hamidullah my dear boy it will help me to recover seeing you
p00169_A,00169,A,forgive my mistakes
p00170_A,00170,A,you re sure i don t tire you by stopping
p00171_A,00171,A,why no there are six people present in my small room already please remain seated if you will excuse the informality

p00175_A,00175,A,none chuck em out
p00176_A,00176,A,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p00177_A,00177,A,oh that is true how true
p00178_A,00178,A,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p00179_A,00179,A,you sit on my leg

p00198_A,00198,A,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p00199_A,00199,A,how very well it is all arranged

p00206_A,00206,A,quite right now enjoy yourselves and when you come back tell me all about it
p00207_A,00207,A,have you one wife or more than one

p00215_A,00215,A,i see you re worrying let s talk of other things miss quested was always to do what she wished it was our arrangement i see you are worrying on my account but really i don t mind i never notice trifles
p00216_A,00216,A,i do worry on your account i consider they have been impolite she had no right to dash away from your party and miss derek had no right to abet her
p00217_A,00217,A,this picnic is nothing to do with english or indian it is an expedition of friends

p00238_A,00238,A,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p00239_A,00239,A,does anyone here present want to

p00244_A,00244,A,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p00245_A,00245,A,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p00246_A,00246,A,stand up you swine
p00247_A,00247,A,i am waiting for the verdict of the courts if he is guilty i resign from my service and leave india i resign from the club now
p00248_A,00248,A,hear hear
p00249_A,00249,A,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p00250_A,00250,A,can mrs moore be with me
p00251_A,00251,A,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p00252_A,00252,A,why should he write to me
p00253_A,00253,A,he s a crank a crank
p00254_A,00254,A,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p00255_A,00255,A,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p00256_A,00256,A,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p00257_A,00257,A,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00258_A,00258,A,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00259_A,00259,A,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00260_A,00260,A,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00261_A,00261,A,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00262_A,00262,A,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00263_A,00263,A,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00264_A,00264,A,i want my pack of patience cards
p00265_A,00265,A,very well get them
p00266_A,00266,A,so you won t go saying he s innocent again will you for every servant i ve got is a spy they all hate us it ll be all right after the verdict for i will say this for them they do accept the accomplished fact but at present they re pouring out money like water to catch us tripping and a remark like yours is the very thing they look out for it would enable them to say it was a put up job on the part of us officials you see what i mean
p00267_A,00267,A,of course he is innocent
p00268_A,00268,A,but she thinks it
p00269_A,00269,A,red nine on black ten
p00270_A,00270,A,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00271_A,00271,A,i know but
p00272_A,00272,A,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00273_A,00273,A,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00274_A,00274,A,most feeble
p00275_A,00275,A,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00276_A,00276,A,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00277_A,00277,A,she s saying her prayers
p00278_A,00278,A,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00279_A,00279,A,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00280_A,00280,A,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00281_A,00281,A,how about aspirin
p00282_A,00282,A,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00283_A,00283,A,you won t
p00284_A,00284,A,yes my dear child
p00285_A,00285,A,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00286_A,00286,A,but you re strictly forbidden to talk like that you re wonderful
p00287_A,00287,A,yes indeed
p00288_A,00288,A,not one of them s all right
p00289_A,00289,A,das is really
p00290_A,00290,A,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p00291_A,00291,A,i didn t mean that
p00292_A,00292,A,all right i said don t apologize
p00293_A,00293,A,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p00294_A,00294,A,even when the lady is so uglier than the gentleman
p00295_A,00295,A,turn that man out
p00296_A,00296,A,i must have better arrangements than this made for my patient why isn t she given a seat on the platform she gets no air
p00297_A,00297,A,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p00298_A,00298,A,that s better
p00299_A,00299,A,are you all right yourselves
p00300_A,00300,A,we shall do we shall do
p00301_A,00301,A,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p00302_A,00302,A,another example of their exquisite sense of humour
p00303_A,00303,A,excuse me we object to the presence of so many european ladies and gentlemen upon the platform they will have the effect of intimidating our witnesses their place is with the rest of the public in the body of the hall we have no objection to miss quested remaining on the platform since she has been unwell we shall extend every courtesy to her throughout despite the scientific truths revealed to us by the district superintendent of police but we do object to the others
p00304_A,00304,A,oh cut the cackle and let s have the verdict
p00305_A,00305,A,i agree to that it was only to miss quested that i gave permission to sit up here her friends should be so excessively kind as to climb down
p00306_A,00306,A,well done das quite sound
p00307_A,00307,A,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00308_A,00308,A,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p00309_A,00309,A,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p00310_A,00310,A,i should object a platform confers authority
p00311_A,00311,A,thank you very much sir thank you mr heaslop thank you ladies all
p00312_A,00312,A,prisoner s dupes
p00313_A,00313,A,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p00314_A,00314,A,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p00315_A,00315,A,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p00316_A,00316,A,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p00317_A,00317,A,do so this trial is a farce i am going aziz aziz farewell for ever
p00318_A,00318,A,unexpected
p00319_A,00319,A,it s just a trick and they happened to pull it off now one sees why they had mahmoud ali just to make a scene on the chance it is his speciality
p00320_A,00320,A,esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor esmiss esmoor
p00321_A,00321,A,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p00322_A,00322,A,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p00323_A,00323,A,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p00324_A,00324,A,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p00325_A,00325,A,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p00326_A,00326,A,that is quite correct
p00327_A,00327,A,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p00328_A,00328,A,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p00329_A,00329,A,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p00330_A,00330,A,dr aziz never
p00331_A,00331,A,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p00332_A,00332,A,i withdraw everything
p00333_A,00333,A,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p00334_A,00334,A,give me time to consider
p00335_A,00335,A,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p00336_A,00336,A,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p00337_A,00337,A,right i withdraw
p00338_A,00338,A,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p00339_A,00339,A,but where am i to go in it
p00340_A,00340,A,sir i intend these for you sir
p00341_A,00341,A,no sir this is an honour for us
p00342_A,00342,A,why isn t cyril following let us turn back
p00343_A,00343,A,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00344_A,00344,A,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p00345_A,00345,A,cyril again you desert
p00346_A,00346,A,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00347_A,00347,A,they are torturing him
p00348_A,00348,A,oh my god
p00349_A,00349,A,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p00350_A,00350,A,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00351_A,00351,A,oh forgive me oh dr aziz forgive the wicked lies i told i was afraid i was mislaid i was mislaid here there and everywhere as regards your character oh forgive the poor old hakim who gave you milk when ill oh nawab bahadur whoever merciful is it my poor little dispensary you require take every cursed bottle
p00352_A,00352,A,someone who was in another cave and followed me when the guide was looking away possibly
p00353_A,00353,A,hullo my dear fielding so i run you down at last can you come out at once to dilkusha
p00354_A,00354,A,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00355_A,00355,A,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p00356_A,00356,A,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p00357_A,00357,A,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p00358_A,00358,A,gladly in a minute
p00359_A,00359,A,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p00360_A,00360,A,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p00361_A,00361,A,quite so i have given trouble enough
p00362_A,00362,A,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p00363_A,00363,A,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00364_A,00364,A,he wants you of course
p00365_A,00365,A,he may not even know i m here
p00366_A,00366,A,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p00367_A,00367,A,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p00368_A,00368,A,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p00369_A,00369,A,perfectly right
p00370_A,00370,A,oh this is unbearable
p00371_A,00371,A,i came to bring miss quested away but her visit to the turtons has ended and there is no other arrangement so far mine are bachelor quarters now
p00372_A,00372,A,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p00373_A,00373,A,aden
p00374_A,00374,A,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p00375_A,00375,A,i m sorry to say mrs moore s dead
p00376_A,00376,A,aziz he is trying to pull your leg don t believe him the villain
p00377_A,00377,A,the broad the sensible the only possible charitable view from the first speaking confidentially mishandled by certain of our friends up the hill the hands of the clock move forward not back
p00378_A,00378,A,mr fielding we must all be educated promptly
p00379_A,00379,A,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p00380_A,00380,A,no no what nonsense excellent
p00381_A,00381,A,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p00382_A,00382,A,tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram thou art my father and mother and everybody tukaram tukaram tukaram tukaram

p00003_B,00003,B,well look at my own experience this morning
p00004_B,00004,B,oh not yet hookah is so jolly now
p00005_B,00005,B,queen victoria was different

p00019_B,00019,B,our schoolmaster government college
p00020_B,00020,B,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00021_B,00021,B,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00022_B,00022,B,that occurs after so many meetings
p00023_B,00023,B,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00024_B,00024,B,how if he went to heaven
p00025_B,00025,B,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00026_B,00026,B,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00027_B,00027,B,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00028_B,00028,B,miss quested what a name
p00029_B,00029,B,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00030_B,00030,B,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00031_B,00031,B,who was he
p00032_B,00032,B,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00033_B,00033,B,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00034_B,00034,B,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00035_B,00035,B,crocodiles down in it too how terrible what a terrible river what a wonderful river
p00036_B,00036,B,aziz what a charming name

p00046_B,00046,B,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00047_B,00047,B,i wonder whether you would allow us to call on you some day
p00048_B,00048,B,when
p00049_B,00049,B,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00050_B,00050,B,thursday
p00051_B,00051,B,you can t have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for our sake
p00052_B,00052,B,no of course not we are not such people
p00053_B,00053,B,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00054_B,00054,B,i should never get like that
p00055_B,00055,B,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00056_B,00056,B,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00057_B,00057,B,never never shall i get over this most certainly my career is a failure and my sons will be badly brought up
p00058_B,00058,B,i am so awfully sorry i was compelled to go to the post office
p00059_B,00059,B,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00060_B,00060,B,i am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence
p00061_B,00061,B,some misunderstanding
p00062_B,00062,B,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00063_B,00063,B,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p00064_B,00064,B,that s a notion
p00065_B,00065,B,i do so hate mysteries
p00066_B,00066,B,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p00067_B,00067,B,a mystery is a muddle
p00068_B,00068,B,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00069_B,00069,B,then back with water streaming over you and perhaps rather a pain inside but i did not mind all my friends were paining with me we have a proverb in urdu what does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy together which comes in conveniently after mangoes miss quested do wait for mangoes why not settle altogether in india
p00070_B,00070,B,i m afraid i can t do that
p00071_B,00071,B,they are indeed such affability is seldom seen but what can we offer to detain them
p00072_B,00072,B,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00073_B,00073,B,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00074_B,00074,B,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00075_B,00075,B,i speak now as a doctor no
p00076_B,00076,B,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p00077_B,00077,B,i don t know why you say that when you have so kindly asked us to your house
p00078_B,00078,B,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p00079_B,00079,B,i know
p00080_B,00080,B,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p00081_B,00081,B,they are immensely holy no doubt
p00082_B,00082,B,good evening
p00083_B,00083,B,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p00084_B,00084,B,come along up and join us mr heaslop sit down till your mother turns up he may not understand that allow me
p00085_B,00085,B,don t trouble to come mother we re just starting
p00086_B,00086,B,i say old man do excuse me but i think perhaps you oughtn t to have left miss quested alone
p00087_B,00087,B,i m sorry what s up
p00088_B,00088,B,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon

p00095_B,00095,B,what was that about caves
p00096_B,00096,B,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00097_B,00097,B,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00098_B,00098,B,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00099_B,00099,B,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00100_B,00100,B,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00101_B,00101,B,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00102_B,00102,B,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00103_B,00103,B,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p00104_B,00104,B,how do you do
p00105_B,00105,B,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00106_B,00106,B,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p00107_B,00107,B,you give me five minutes time i ll take you any dam anywhere
p00108_B,00108,B,not a bit
p00109_B,00109,B,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p00110_B,00110,B,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p00111_B,00111,B,we didn t skid we ran into an animal
p00112_B,00112,B,an animal
p00113_B,00113,B,by jove she s right the paint s gone
p00114_B,00114,B,by jove sir your lady is right
p00115_B,00115,B,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p00116_B,00116,B,i say adela what was it
p00117_B,00117,B,exactly too big for a goat
p00118_B,00118,B,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p00119_B,00119,B,i believe it was a buffalo
p00120_B,00120,B,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p00121_B,00121,B,take me too
p00122_B,00122,B,heh what about me
p00123_B,00123,B,now what s all this i m not an omnibus i ve a harmonium and two dogs in here with me as it is i ll take three of you if one ll sit in front and nurse a pug no more
p00124_B,00124,B,i will sit in front
p00125_B,00125,B,heh no what about my dinner i can t be left alone all the night
p00126_B,00126,B,nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle i shall despatch him with all possible speed meanwhile repair my car
p00127_B,00127,B,i don t believe in these people letting you down if i didn t snatch like the devil i should be nowhere he doesn t want the car silly fool surely it s to the credit of his state i should be seen about in it at chandrapore during my leave he ought to look at it that way anyhow he s got to look at it that way my maharani s different my maharani s a dear that s her fox terrier poor little devil i fished them out both with the driver imagine taking dogs to a chiefs conference as sensible as taking chiefs perhaps the harmonium the harmonium s my little mistake i own they rather had me over the harmonium i meant it to stop on the train oh lor they always sack me before that happens and then i get another job the whole of india seethes with maharanis and ranis and begums who clamour for such as me
p00128_B,00128,B,really i had no idea
p00129_B,00129,B,i understand those big people are not particularly interesting
p00130_B,00130,B,i would scarcely call her wrong a native state a hindu state the wife of a ruler of a hindu state may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady and let it not be for a moment supposed that i suggest anything against the character of her highness the maharani of mudkul but i fear she will be uneducated i fear she will be superstitious indeed how could she be otherwise what opportunity of education has such a lady had oh superstition is terrible terrible oh it is the great defect in our indian character oh it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off and though i have little experience of hindu states and none of this particular one namely mudkul the ruler i fancy has a salute of but eleven guns yet i cannot imagine that they have been as successful as british india where we see reason and orderliness spreading in every direction like a most health giving flood
p00131_B,00131,B,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p00132_B,00132,B,come along and let s tell the mater all this
p00133_B,00133,B,look here both of you see india if you like and as you like i know i made myself rather ridiculous at fielding s but it s different now i wasn t quite sure of myself
p00134_B,00134,B,what does our old gentleman of the car think
p00135_B,00135,B,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00136_B,00136,B,what animal
p00137_B,00137,B,an accident
p00138_B,00138,B,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00139_B,00139,B,no englishman understands us except mr fielding but how shall i see him again if he entered this room the disgrace of it would kill me that s india all over how like us there we are
p00140_B,00140,B,when an engineer falls ill it is equally important
p00141_B,00141,B,dr aziz took tea with our principal last thursday afternoon professor godbole who also attended has sickened too which seems rather a curious thing sir does it not
p00142_B,00142,B,humbug
p00143_B,00143,B,is professor godbole ill i am sincerely sorry how do you do mr syed mohammed mr haq how very kind of you to enquire after my health how do you do hamidullah but you bring me bad news what is wrong with him the excellent fellow
p00144_B,00144,B,why don t you answer rafi you re the great authority
p00145_B,00145,B,yes rafi s the great man rafi is the sherlock holmes of chandrapore speak up rafi
p00146_B,00146,B,if this is so this is a very serious thing this is scarcely the end of march why have i not been informed
p00147_B,00147,B,all illness proceeds from hindus
p00148_B,00148,B,that is exactly my own view
p00149_B,00149,B,i shall not forget those affectionate words
p00150_B,00150,B,add mine to them
p00151_B,00151,B,and mine
p00152_B,00152,B,and sir accept mine
p00153_B,00153,B,here he lies
p00154_B,00154,B,i think not much
p00155_B,00155,B,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p00156_B,00156,B,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p00157_B,00157,B,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p00158_B,00158,B,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p00159_B,00159,B,and so much my dear rafi for your cholera
p00160_B,00160,B,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p00161_B,00161,B,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p00162_B,00162,B,it is only a boy
p00163_B,00163,B,even boys must learn
p00164_B,00164,B,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p00165_B,00165,B,sit down
p00166_B,00166,B,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p00167_B,00167,B,forgive my mistakes
p00168_B,00168,B,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p00169_B,00169,B,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00170_B,00170,B,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p00171_B,00171,B,oh that is true how true
p00172_B,00172,B,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p00173_B,00173,B,but how then can you believe in god
p00174_B,00174,B,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p00175_B,00175,B,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p00176_B,00176,B,oh that is true how true
p00177_B,00177,B,it is not the end of time it is scarcely ten thirty ha ha gentlemen if i may be allowed to say a few words what an interesting talk also thankfulness and gratitude to mr fielding in the first place teaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his experience and judgment
p00178_B,00178,B,dr lal
p00179_B,00179,B,come along we tire the invalid in either case
p00180_B,00180,B,how did you like the two ladies you met last thursday how do you like englishwomen generally
p00181_B,00181,B,but you ve come after all oh how very very kind of you this is the happiest moment in all my life you don t require tickets please stop your servant there are no tickets on the marabar branch line it is its peculiarity you come to the carriage and rest till mr fielding joins us did you know you are to travel purdah will you like that
p00182_B,00182,B,and he is such a horrible servant antony you can go we don t want you
p00183_B,00183,B,master told me to come
p00184_B,00184,B,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english
p00185_B,00185,B,tell me another time brother when i have more leisure for now as i have already explained we have to give pleasure to non moslems three will be europeans one a hindu which must not be forgotten every attention must be paid to professor godbole lest he feel that he is inferior to my other guests
p00186_B,00186,B,i will discuss philosophy with him
p00187_B,00187,B,godbole s pujah did it
p00188_B,00188,B,jump on i must have you
p00189_B,00189,B,he s not to he ll kill himself
p00190_B,00190,B,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00191_B,00191,B,get in get in you ll kill yourself as well as mr fielding i see no ruin
p00192_B,00192,B,get in dr aziz you make us giddy if they re so foolish as to miss the train that s their loss not ours
p00193_B,00193,B,i am to blame i am the host
p00194_B,00194,B,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00195_B,00195,B,good morning good morning put on your own
p00196_B,00196,B,perhaps it is a circular train and goes back to chandrapore without a break who knows
p00197_B,00197,B,a snake it isn t a snake
p00198_B,00198,B,a horrid stuffy place really
p00199_B,00199,B,oh what more can i do for her
p00200_B,00200,B,do you know about the others she will never talk about them to me
p00201_B,00201,B,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00202_B,00202,B,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p00203_B,00203,B,i forget
p00204_B,00204,B,quite right i m sorry not to come too but i m a poor walker
p00205_B,00205,B,i am going to be ill
p00206_B,00206,B,pretty sure they should come on some interesting old carvings soon
p00207_B,00207,B,damn the english even at their best
p00208_B,00208,B,sight seeing bores me
p00209_B,00209,B,good morning again
p00210_B,00210,B,aziz where have you put miss quested to
p00211_B,00211,B,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00212_B,00212,B,miss derek is most unsatisfactory and restless always in a hurry always wanting something new she will do anything in the world except go back to the indian lady who pays her
p00213_B,00213,B,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00214_B,00214,B,this man having missed the train tries to blame us
p00215_B,00215,B,aziz have you figured out what this picnic will cost you
p00216_B,00216,B,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00217_B,00217,B,hullo some mistake
p00218_B,00218,B,my children and my name
p00219_B,00219,B,ah thank god he comes
p00220_B,00220,B,oh no oh no no
p00221_B,00221,B,i know what you re like at last you shall pay for this you shall squeal
p00222_B,00222,B,well you must trot off now old man and the lord help us the lord help us all
p00223_B,00223,B,then they ve started
p00224_B,00224,B,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00225_B,00225,B,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00226_B,00226,B,mr mcbryde s down there disguised as a holy man
p00227_B,00227,B,that s exactly the sort of thing that must not be said mrs callendar be more careful than that please in these times
p00228_B,00228,B,is the where is he
p00229_B,00229,B,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00230_B,00230,B,and a jolly suggestion the army s got to come in sooner or later a special train was in his mind inseparable from troops this would never have happened if barabas hill was under military control station a bunch of gurkhas at the entrance of the cave was all that was wanted
p00231_B,00231,B,don t start carrying arms about i want everything to go on precisely as usual until there s cause for the contrary get the womenfolk off to the hills but do it quietly and for heaven s sake no more talk of special trains never mind what you think or feel possibly i have feelings too one isolated indian has attempted is charged with an attempted crime act upon that fact until there are more facts assume every indian is an angel
p00232_B,00232,B,exactly what i said the native s all right if you get him alone lesley lesley you remember the one i had a knock with on your maidan last month well he was all right any native who plays polo is all right what you ve got to stamp on is these educated classes and mind i do know what i m talking about this time
p00233_B,00233,B,squat down callendar tell us all about it
p00234_B,00234,B,i wish to god i hadn t given my jewel of an assistant leave i ld cut my tongue out first to feel i m responsible that s what hits me to refuse and then give in under pressure that is what i did my sons that is what i did i understood an englishman was to accompany the expedition that is why i gave in
p00235_B,00235,B,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p00236_B,00236,B,then what do you mean
p00237_B,00237,B,why should it
p00238_B,00238,B,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p00239_B,00239,B,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p00240_B,00240,B,some have never got up
p00241_B,00241,B,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p00242_B,00242,B,i do i do i m satisfied
p00243_B,00243,B,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p00244_B,00244,B,stand up you swine
p00245_B,00245,B,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p00246_B,00246,B,may i make a statement sir
p00247_B,00247,B,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p00248_B,00248,B,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p00249_B,00249,B,let him go
p00250_B,00250,B,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p00251_B,00251,B,i must come before someone
p00252_B,00252,B,he s a crank a crank
p00253_B,00253,B,is it
p00254_B,00254,B,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p00255_B,00255,B,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00256_B,00256,B,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00257_B,00257,B,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00258_B,00258,B,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00259_B,00259,B,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00260_B,00260,B,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00261_B,00261,B,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00262_B,00262,B,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00263_B,00263,B,you can t go to england in may as you agreed

p00273_B,00273,B,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00274_B,00274,B,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00275_B,00275,B,she has started the machinery it will work to its end
p00276_B,00276,B,and if it had if it had there are worse evils than love less attention should be paid to my future daughter in law and more to me there is no sorrow like my sorrow i have not seen the right places

p00303_B,00303,B,i agree to that it was only to miss quested that i gave permission to sit up here her friends should be so excessively kind as to climb down

p00343_B,00343,B,cyril again you desert
p00344_B,00344,B,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00345_B,00345,B,down with the civil surgeon rescue nureddin
p00346_B,00346,B,nureddin
p00347_B,00347,B,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p00348_B,00348,B,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00349_B,00349,B,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00350_B,00350,B,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00351_B,00351,B,we will have rejoicings to night mr hamidullah i depute you to bring out our friends fielding and amritrao and to discover whether the latter will require special food the others will keep with me we shall not go out to dilkusha until the cool of the evening of course i do not know the feelings of other gentlemen for my own part i have a slight headache and i wish i had thought to ask our good panna lal for aspirin
p00352_B,00352,B,at once
p00353_B,00353,B,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00354_B,00354,B,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p00355_B,00355,B,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p00356_B,00356,B,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p00357_B,00357,B,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p00358_B,00358,B,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p00359_B,00359,B,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p00360_B,00360,B,quite so i have given trouble enough
p00361_B,00361,B,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p00362_B,00362,B,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00363_B,00363,B,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p00364_B,00364,B,i ll see him first if you prefer
p00365_B,00365,B,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p00366_B,00366,B,does he tell me to come out to him
p00367_B,00367,B,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p00368_B,00368,B,thank goodness that s over
p00369_B,00369,B,it was insulting of him not to come in
p00370_B,00370,B,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00371_B,00371,B,we hear sir that your mother has died may we ask where the cable came from
p00372_B,00372,B,aden
p00373_B,00373,B,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p00374_B,00374,B,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p00375_B,00375,B,i do not believe him
p00376_B,00376,B,this really is the end and i gave her the final blow
p00377_B,00377,B,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00378_B,00378,B,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00379_B,00379,B,i wish they did not remind me of cow dung
p00380_B,00380,B,some moslems are very violent
p00381_B,00381,B,in other words probably never for i am going quite soon to england
p00382_B,00382,B,one old englishwoman and one little little wasp it does not seem much still it is more than i am myself
p00383_B,00383,B,ahmed come here for such wickedness
p00384_B,00384,B,hullo gentlemen are you in trouble lie down in a pool of water my dear sir here are plenty don t come near me i cannot control them they are state bees complain to his highness of their behaviour come pull yourself together and be a man
p00385_B,00385,B,i m only ralph moore
p00386_B,00386,B,and pray what is wrong with my attitude
p00387_B,00387,B,state doctor ridden over to enquire very little english
p00388_B,00388,B,born of too old a mother
p00389_B,00389,B,mr moore don t tell anyone that the rajah is dead it is a secret still i am supposed not to say we pretend he is alive until after the festival to prevent unhappiness do you want to go still nearer
p00390_B,00390,B,as i fell into our largest mau tank under circumstances our other friends will relate i thought how brave miss quested was and decided to tell her so despite my imperfect english through you i am happy here with my children instead of in a prison of that i make no doubt my children shall be taught to speak of you with the greatest affection and respect
