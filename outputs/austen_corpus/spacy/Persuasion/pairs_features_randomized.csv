Mr Shepherd,Sir Walter Elliot,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd,11,3,1,1,20,5,1,1,20,0,1,0,12,5,1,1,8,4,1,1,1,0,1,0,27,4,1,1,26,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,240,40,6,5,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,M,intermediate

Captain Wentworth,Anne Elliot,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion,24,10,1,1,56,23,1,1,37,21,1,1,23,16,1,1,22,9,1,1,11,5,1,1,72,31,1,1,47,26,1,1,1,1,1,1,468,200,421,426,Anne Elliot,M,major,F,major
Captain Wentworth,Anne Elliot,perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added,oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player,3,1,1,1,17,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,5,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,18,3,1,1,17,2,1,1,0,1,0,1,113,16,423,379,Anne Elliot,M,major,F,major

Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,i did,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not,0,6,0,1,0,16,0,1,0,7,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,9,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,14,1,1,0,13,0,1,0,3,0,1,2,116,314,345,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me,23,5,1,1,53,11,1,1,27,6,1,1,32,6,1,1,37,5,1,1,4,2,1,1,78,19,1,1,44,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,479,97,320,299,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,i know it all i know it all he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message,4,2,1,1,12,8,1,1,13,2,1,1,8,2,1,1,17,4,1,1,2,1,1,1,33,10,1,1,14,9,1,1,0,0,0,0,143,66,322,311,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived,9,4,1,1,16,4,1,1,17,1,1,1,6,2,1,1,18,3,1,1,2,2,1,1,31,9,1,1,21,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,175,57,324,339,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes,1,5,1,1,2,11,1,1,1,8,1,1,3,7,1,1,0,7,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,11,1,1,3,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,26,103,326,223,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty,how do you do,6,0,1,0,8,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,6,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,1,1,10,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,97,4,328,263,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot,12,0,1,0,23,0,1,0,16,0,1,0,5,2,1,1,30,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,28,2,1,1,23,2,1,1,3,0,1,0,215,9,330,325,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,12,0,1,0,23,6,1,1,17,2,1,1,14,6,1,1,13,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,36,6,1,1,25,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,230,50,332,331,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness,3,1,1,1,9,9,1,1,6,1,1,1,7,6,1,1,9,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,18,7,1,1,8,6,1,1,1,0,1,0,91,61,342,347,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,colonel wallis you are acquainted with him,38,0,1,0,52,1,1,1,59,0,1,0,39,0,1,0,49,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,68,2,1,1,63,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,607,7,344,337,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major

Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one,it first came into my head upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago,1,3,1,1,5,5,1,1,0,8,0,1,1,6,1,1,2,5,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,11,1,1,2,9,1,1,0,1,0,1,31,65,303,306,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,no i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that do tell me how it first came into your head,yes he was not married when i knew him first,4,0,1,0,18,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,12,1,1,1,19,2,1,1,9,1,1,1,34,3,1,1,14,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,174,10,305,316,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate

Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message,no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed,2,11,1,1,8,5,1,1,2,9,1,1,2,17,1,1,4,16,1,1,1,3,1,1,10,27,1,1,9,20,1,1,0,1,0,1,66,166,311,338,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,0,9,0,1,1,16,1,1,0,17,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,18,0,1,0,2,0,1,2,31,1,1,1,21,1,1,0,0,0,0,11,175,313,324,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,not before he was married i suppose,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him,0,23,0,1,1,53,1,1,1,27,1,1,0,32,0,1,1,37,1,1,1,4,1,1,2,78,1,1,0,44,0,1,0,1,0,1,7,479,315,320,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate

Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger,2,12,1,1,4,23,1,1,1,17,1,1,6,14,1,1,4,13,1,1,0,1,0,1,5,36,1,1,3,25,1,1,0,0,0,0,38,230,319,332,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis,4,5,1,1,8,15,1,1,4,15,1,1,7,4,1,1,11,8,1,1,2,3,1,1,14,27,1,1,12,8,1,1,1,2,1,1,89,133,321,302,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,i did,1,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,6,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,11,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,63,2,323,314,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,0,9,0,1,0,17,0,1,0,18,0,1,2,3,1,1,0,16,0,1,0,5,0,1,2,24,1,1,2,12,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,178,325,346,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now,1,6,1,1,6,13,1,1,4,15,1,1,4,18,1,1,6,12,1,1,1,3,1,1,11,20,1,1,4,14,1,1,1,1,1,1,70,172,327,224,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate

Anne Elliot,Mrs Smith,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty,0,6,0,1,6,8,1,1,2,8,1,1,6,6,1,1,3,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,9,1,1,3,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,50,97,331,328,Mrs Smith,F,major,F,intermediate
