p00730_A,00730,A,i have no right to give my opinion as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family,1,85.14,72.97,20.27,17.57,8.11,0,5.41,4.05,0,2.7,1.35,13.51,13.51,12.16,9.46,4.05,2.7
p00731_A,00731,A,i cannot pretend to be sorry that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen,1,83.93,67.86,21.43,16.07,3.57,0,0,10.71,1.79,5.36,1.79,12.5,12.5,5.36,12.5,5.36,1.79

p00733_A,00733,A,oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father it was the prospect of constant society and good society which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now,1,75.26,63.92,18.9,13.75,8.25,0.69,0,4.12,0.69,5.15,6.53,11.68,13.06,3.44,6.53,2.41,2.75
p00734_A,00734,A,yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere,1,81.82,61.82,21.82,18.18,9.09,0,0,9.09,0,3.64,7.27,10.91,10.91,5.45,7.27,1.82,3.64
p00735_A,00735,A,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me,1,79.5,68.32,19.25,8.7,6.21,0.62,0,1.86,0,10.56,6.21,14.29,10.56,4.97,8.07,3.73,3.73

p00737_A,00737,A,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me,1,77.03,59.46,20.27,16.22,9.46,1.35,0,5.41,0,4.05,8.11,13.51,8.11,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

p00740_A,00740,A,it is wonderful for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride,1,80.77,69.23,19.23,13.46,1.92,3.85,0,7.69,0,5.77,0,15.38,15.38,7.69,9.62,1.92,3.85
p00741_A,00741,A,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers,1,72.9,57.94,14.02,10.28,0,0,0.93,9.35,0,3.74,6.54,14.95,8.41,4.67,8.41,0.93,1.87
p00742_A,00742,A,i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education,1,77.17,65.22,21.74,20.65,8.7,0,0,11.96,0,1.09,4.35,10.87,9.78,7.61,11.96,1.09,5.43

p00750_A,00750,A,you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart,1,73.57,67.86,22.14,16.43,5,0,1.43,7.86,0.71,5.71,2.86,16.43,12.14,7.86,4.29,0.71,2.86
