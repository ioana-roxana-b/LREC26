Q336,and you were his comfort through everything,Louisa Bounderby,['Cecilia Jupe']

Q512,no dear tom i won t forget,Louisa Bounderby,['Young Thomas']
Q513,that s a capital girl good bye loo,Young Thomas,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q514,my dear louisa i prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together you have been so well trained and you do i am happy to say so much justice to the education you have received that i have perfect confidence in your good sense you are not impulsive you are not romantic you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation from that ground alone i know you will view and consider what i am going to communicate,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q515,louisa my dear you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q516,a proposal of marriage my dear,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q517,i hear you father i am attending i assure you,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q518,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q519,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q520,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q521,father do you think i love mr bounderby,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q522,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q523,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q524,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q525,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q526,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q527,difficult to answer it yes or no father,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q528,certainly my dear because,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q529,because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q530,what would you advise me to use in its stead father,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q531,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q532,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q533,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q534,shall i marry him,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q535,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q536,no father i do not,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q537,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q538,are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q539,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q540,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q541,father i have often thought that life is very short,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q542,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q543,i speak of my own life father,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q544,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q545,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q546,how matter what matter my dear,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q547,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q548,certainly my dear,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q549,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q550,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q551,none father what does it matter,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q552,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q553,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q554,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q555,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q556,my dear quite true quite true,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q557,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q558,my dear louisa you abundantly repay my care kiss me my dear girl,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q559,i may assure you now my favourite child that i am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived mr bounderby is a very remarkable man and what little disparity can be said to exist between you if any is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired it has always been my object so to educate you as that you might while still in your early youth be if i may so express myself almost any age kiss me once more louisa now let us go and find your mother,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q560,mrs gradgrind allow me to present to you mrs bounderby,Thomas Gradgrind,"['Louisa Bounderby', 'Cecilia Jupe', 'Mrs. Gradgrind']"
Q561,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him,Mrs. Gradgrind,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Louisa Bounderby', 'Cecilia Jupe']"
Q562,mrs gradgrind what do you mean,Thomas Gradgrind,"['Louisa Bounderby', 'Cecilia Jupe', 'Mrs. Gradgrind']"
Q563,whatever i am to call him mr gradgrind when he is married to louisa i must call him something it s impossible to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name i cannot call him josiah for the name is insupportable to me you yourself wouldn t hear of joe you very well know am i to call my own son in law mister not i believe unless the time has arrived when as an invalid i am to be trampled upon by my relations then what am i to call him,Mrs. Gradgrind,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Louisa Bounderby', 'Cecilia Jupe']"
Q564,as to the wedding all i ask louisa is and i ask it with a fluttering in my chest which actually extends to the soles of my feet that it may take place soon otherwise i know it is one of those subjects i shall never hear the last of,Mrs. Gradgrind,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Louisa Bounderby', 'Cecilia Jupe']"

Q916,yes,Louisa Bounderby,['Mr. James Harthouse']

Q924,candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q925,i do not think it likely,Louisa Bounderby,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q926,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q930,so spirited too,Mr. James Harthouse,[]
Q931,when i married i found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt heavily for him i mean heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets they were no sacrifice i sold them very willingly i attached no value to them they were quite worthless to me,Louisa Bounderby,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q932,since then i have given my brother at various times what money i could spare in short what money i have had confiding in you at all on the faith of the interest you profess for him i will not do so by halves since you have been in the habit of visiting here he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds i have not been able to give it to him i have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved but i have kept these secrets until now when i trust them to your honour i have held no confidence with any one because you anticipated my reason just now,Louisa Bounderby,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q933,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q934,all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q935,perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q936,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it,Louisa Bounderby,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q937,to relieve you from needless apprehension and as this confidence regarding your brother which i prize i am sure above all possible things has been established between us i obey i cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word look and act of his life of the affection of his best friend of the devotion of his best friend of her unselfishness of her sacrifice the return he makes her within my observation is a very poor one what she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude not his ill humour and caprice careless fellow as i am i am not so indifferent mrs bounderby as to be regardless of this vice in your brother or inclined to consider it a venial offence,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q938,in a word it is to correct your brother in this mrs bounderby that i must aspire my better knowledge of his circumstances and my direction and advice in extricating them rather valuable i hope as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale will give me some influence over him and all i gain i shall certainly use towards this end i have said enough and more than enough i seem to be protesting that i am a sort of good fellow when upon my honour i have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect and openly announce that i am nothing of the sort yonder among the trees is your brother himself no doubt just come down as he seems to be loitering in this direction it may be as well perhaps to walk towards him and throw ourselves in his way he has been very silent and doleful of late perhaps his brotherly conscience is touched if there are such things as consciences though upon my honour i hear of them much too often to believe in them,Mr. James Harthouse,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q1223,my dear louisa my poor daughter,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q1224,my unfortunate child it would be hopeless for me louisa to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed i have been and still am by what broke upon me last night the ground on which i stand has ceased to be solid under my feet the only support on which i leaned and the strength of which it seemed and still does seem impossible to question has given way in an instant i am stunned by these discoveries i have no selfish meaning in what i say but i find the shock of what broke upon me last night to be very heavy indeed,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q1225,i will not say louisa that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago it would have been better for us both better for your peace and better for mine for i am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind i had proved my my system to myself and i have rigidly administered it and i must bear the responsibility of its failures i only entreat you to believe my favourite child that i have meant to do right,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q1227,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q1228,but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']
Q1229,some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q1236,i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q1246,have i always hated you so much,Louisa Bounderby,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1247,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt,Cecilia Jupe,['Louisa Bounderby']

Q1277,you may i assure you,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1278,i am young as you see i am alone as you see in coming to you sir i have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope but that is very strong this is a very odd beginning i don t see where we are going,Mr. James Harthouse,[]
Q1279,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1280,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1281,i left her within an hour,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1282,at,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']

Q1286,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1287,i have no charge from her,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1288,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1289,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1290,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1291,it is still true there is no hope,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1292,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1293,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1294,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1295,after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1296,you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1297,yes,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1298,will you oblige me by confiding it,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1299,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1300,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1301,besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1302,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1303,upon my soul i don t know what to say so immensely absurd,Mr. James Harthouse,[]
Q1304,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1305,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1306,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1307,you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']
Q1308,my name,Cecilia Jupe,['Mr. James Harthouse']
Q1309,the only name i could possibly care to know to night,Mr. James Harthouse,['Cecilia Jupe']

Q1321,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1322,if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1323,indeed,Thomas Gradgrind,"['Josiah Bounderby', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1324,ah indeed and in that conversation,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"

Q1328,here,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1329,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet,Thomas Gradgrind,"['Josiah Bounderby', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1330,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1331,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears,Mrs. Sparsit,"['Josiah Bounderby', 'Thomas Gradgrind']"
Q1332,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed,Josiah Bounderby,"['Thomas Gradgrind', 'Mrs. Sparsit']"
Q1333,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1334,my dear bounderby,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1335,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1336,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1337,i thought you couldn t make em,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1338,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1339,i never mentioned his name,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1340,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1341,who do you mean by we,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1342,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1343,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1344,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1345,i don t see it at all sir,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1346,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1347,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1348,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1349,you d like to keep her here for a time,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1350,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1351,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1352,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1353,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1354,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1355,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1356,bounderby this is unreasonable,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1357,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1358,whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1359,not i fear to spare me,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1360,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1361,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby']
Q1362,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
Q1363,till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind']
