Q0,i can tell you nothing aunt juley i know no more than you do we met we only met the father and mother abroad last spring i know so little that i didn t even know their son s name it s all so,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q1,in that case it is far too sudden,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q2,who knows aunt juley who knows,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q3,but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q4,who knows,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q5,but margaret dear,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q6,i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q7,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q8,the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q9,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q10,exactly germans are too thorough,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q11,of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q12,and that reminds me helen s letter,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q13,oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q14,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q15,i gathered nothing,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q16,then in that case,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q17,in that case i can make no plans don t you see,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q18,on the contrary,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q19,i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q20,then in that case my dear why go down,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q21,i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q22,aunt juley,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q23,i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q24,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q25,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q26,if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q27,dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q28,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q29,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q30,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q31,i think probably it must but slowly,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q32,can you break an engagement off slowly,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q33,what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q34,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q35,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q36,you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q37,so uncivilised,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']

Q138,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times,Helen,['Margaret']
Q139,was paul there,Margaret,['Helen']
Q140,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened,Helen,['Margaret']
Q141,somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness,Helen,['Margaret']
Q142,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife,Margaret,['Helen']
Q143,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes,Helen,['Margaret']
Q144,and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said,Helen,['Margaret']
Q145,and i said,Helen,['Margaret']
Q146,and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew,Helen,['Margaret']
Q147,knew what,Margaret,['Helen']
Q148,everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think,Helen,['Margaret']
Q149,oh she must have overheard you,Margaret,['Helen']
Q150,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that,Helen,['Margaret']
Q151,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger,Margaret,['Helen']
Q152,i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end,Margaret,['Helen']
Q153,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes,Helen,['Margaret']
Q154,don t you feel it now,Margaret,['Helen']
Q155,i remember paul at breakfast i shall never forget him he had nothing to fall back upon i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever,Helen,['Margaret']
Q156,amen,Margaret,['Helen']
Q157,do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst,A Haughty And Magnificent Nephew,"['Uncle Ernst', 'Margaret']"
Q158,to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity,Uncle Ernst,"['A Haughty And Magnificent Nephew', 'Margaret']"
Q159,you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within,Uncle Ernst,"['A Haughty And Magnificent Nephew', 'Margaret']"
Q160,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question,Margaret,"['Uncle Ernst', 'Aunt Juley']"

Q332,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q333,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']

Q356,helen cannot deceive me she does mind,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q357,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q358,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']

Q369,i hope to risk things all my life,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q370,oh margaret most dangerous,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q371,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q372,oh shame what a shocking speech,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q373,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q374,but this is something quite new,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q375,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q376,i call that rather cynical,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q377,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q378,that s more like socialism,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']
Q379,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality,Margaret,['Aunt Juley']
Q380,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh,Aunt Juley,['Margaret']

Q496,indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret']

Q500,never,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']"
Q501,people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses at least our cousins do but aren t particularly rich the town isn t interesting except for a clock that rolls its eyes and the view of the oder which truly is something special oh mrs wilcox you would love the oder the river or rather rivers there seem to be dozens of them are intense blue and the plain they run through an intensest green,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q502,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']"
Q503,so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q504,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'Margaret']"
Q505,they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q506,is anything gained by that,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'Margaret']"
Q507,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q508,i am not sure that i agree do you,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'Margaret']"
Q509,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']"
Q510,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q511,i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']"
Q512,the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"

Q515,on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form,Margaret,"['Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q516,you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs,Margaret,"['A Girl Opposite', 'Mrs. Wilcox', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office']"
Q517,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']"

Q1793,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not,Leonard,['Helen']
Q1794,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men,Helen,['Leonard']
Q1795,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking,Leonard,['Helen']

Q1804,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death,Helen,['Leonard']
Q1805,if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i,Helen,['Leonard']
Q1806,i wonder,Leonard,['Helen']
Q1807,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever,Helen,['Leonard']

Q1866,sunrise or something when i could get away,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1867,so i surmise why,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1868,i don t know what s to be done tibby i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place i stopped here to tell you this,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1869,give meg my love and say that i want to be alone i mean to go to munich or else bonn,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1870,such a message is easily given,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1871,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1872,i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though,Helen,['Tibby']

Q1877,now for the explanation why didn t i begin with it i have found out something about mr wilcox he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people s lives it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do mrs bast,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1878,oh those people,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1879,shall i lock the door again,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1880,no thanks tibbikins you re being very good to me i want to tell you the story before i go abroad you must do exactly what you like treat it as part of the furniture meg cannot have heard it yet i think but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself i don t even know whether she ought to be told knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match i simply don t know what to make of such a thing i trust your judgment what would you do,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1881,i gather he has had a mistress,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1882,and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1883,they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1884,but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1885,it is certainly a very bad business,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1886,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion but you are right outside it and you must know in a day or two or perhaps a week take whatever steps you think fit i leave it in your hands,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1887,the facts as they touch meg are all before you,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1888,you see helen have a cigarette i don t see what i m to do,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1889,then there s nothing to be done i dare say you are right let them marry there remains the question of compensation,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1890,do you want me to adjudicate that too had you not better consult an expert,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1891,this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1892,what is the sum,Tibby,['Helen']
Q1893,five thousand,Helen,['Tibby']
Q1894,good god alive,Tibby,['Helen']

Q2329,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2330,i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2331,no,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2332,henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2333,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2334,take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2335,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2336,would she not tell you,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2337,i never even asked her who seduced her,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2338,that is singular,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2339,natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2340,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2341,as you like,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2342,have you anything else to ask me henry,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2343,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2344,who is we,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2345,i thought it best to ring up charles,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2346,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2347,he has at once gone to call on your brother,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2348,that too was unnecessary,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2349,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2350,are we to make her seducer marry her,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2351,if possible yes,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2352,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2353,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2354,may i ask you my question now,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2355,certainly my dear,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2356,to morrow helen goes to munich,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2357,well possibly she is right,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2358,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2359,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2360,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2361,she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2362,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2363,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2364,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2365,because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2366,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2367,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2368,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2369,no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2370,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2371,she cannot be left alone,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2372,that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2373,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2374,margaret my margaret,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2375,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2376,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2377,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2378,my dear you are forgetting yourself,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2379,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2380,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2381,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2382,as i have actually been forgiven,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2383,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2384,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2385,you have mentioned mrs wilcox,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2386,i beg your pardon,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2387,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2388,you have not been yourself all day,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2389,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2390,the two cases are different,Henry,['Margaret']
Q2391,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry,Margaret,['Henry']
Q2392,i perceive you are attempting blackmail it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end,Henry,['Margaret']

Q2407,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others,Margaret,['Helen']
Q2408,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts,Helen,['Margaret']
Q2409,looking back that was wrong of me,Margaret,['Helen']
Q2410,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things,Helen,['Margaret']
Q2411,the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul,Helen,['Margaret']
Q2412,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge,Margaret,['Helen']
Q2413,i did react until i found poor leonard i am steady now i shan t ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy,Helen,['Margaret']
