Q0,poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q1,i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q2,a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q3,how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q4,my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q5,no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q6,the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q7,they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q8,i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q9,it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q10,not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q11,but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q12,dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q13,well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q14,by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q15,ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q16,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q17,i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q18,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q19,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q20,my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q21,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q22,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q23,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q24,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q25,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q26,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q27,i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q28,ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q29,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q30,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q31,a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q32,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q33,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q34,mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q35,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q36,ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay,Mr. Woodhouse,[]
Q37,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q38,two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q39,well done mrs martin you know what you are about,Emma,[]
Q40,and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q41,mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q42,oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q43,what sort of looking man is mr martin,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q44,oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q45,that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q46,to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q47,i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q48,he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q49,only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q50,six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q51,well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q52,to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q53,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q54,yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q55,you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q56,to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q57,only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q58,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q59,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q60,i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q61,certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q62,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q63,oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q64,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q65,there is no saying indeed,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q66,but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q67,will he indeed that will be very bad,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q68,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q69,i wonder he did not remember the book,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q70,in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q71,i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q72,a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q73,i think they will neither of them do the other any good,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q74,you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q75,perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q76,mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q77,emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you could not,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q78,i dare say that i thought so then but since we have parted i can never remember emma s omitting to do any thing i wished,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q79,there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q80,but i who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q81,i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q82,yes you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q83,thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q84,why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q85,i hope not that it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q86,not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life they only give a little polish,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q87,i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q88,oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q89,pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q90,i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q91,such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q92,i have not a fault to find with her person i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q93,and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q94,very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q95,i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q96,not at all i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q97,mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q98,be satisfied i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q99,so do i very much,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q100,she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q101,there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you,Mrs. Weston,['Mr. Knightley']
Q102,what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain,Mr. Knightley,['Mrs. Weston']
Q103,you have given miss smith all that she required you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q104,i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q105,if it were admissible to contradict a lady,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q106,i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q107,exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q108,great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q109,i have no doubt of it,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q110,did you ever have your likeness taken harriet did you ever sit for your picture,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q111,oh dear no never,Harriet Smith,"['Mr. Elton', 'Emma']"
Q112,what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q113,let me entreat you it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q114,well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q115,exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q116,but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q117,oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q118,no great variety of faces for you i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that s very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side yes it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q119,no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q120,by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q121,miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q122,do you think so i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q123,you have made her too tall emma,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q124,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q125,it is very pretty so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q126,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q127,but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q128,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q129,what a precious deposit,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q130,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q131,will you read the letter pray do i d rather you would,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q132,well well,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q133,is it a good letter or is it too short,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q134,yes indeed a very good letter so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet than i had expected,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q135,well well and and what shall i do,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q136,what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q137,yes,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q138,but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course and speedily,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q139,yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q140,oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q141,you think i ought to refuse him then,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q142,ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q143,you mean to return a favourable answer i collect,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q144,no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q145,i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q146,i had no notion that he liked me so very much,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q147,i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q148,oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q149,not for the world would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q150,miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q151,perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q152,you could not have visited me no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q153,indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q154,dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q155,dear affectionate creature you banished to abbey mill farm you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q156,i do not think he is conceited either in general at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q157,thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q158,oh no and it is but a short letter too,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q159,oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q160,i shall never be invited to abbey mill again,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q161,nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q162,and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q163,i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q164,one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q165,now he has got my letter i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q166,let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q167,my picture but he has left my picture in bond street,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q168,has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q169,well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we are privileged people,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q170,my dear sir do not make a stranger of me,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q171,i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q172,you cannot do better sir,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q173,i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q174,thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q175,i cannot rate her beauty as you do but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q176,i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q177,come you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q178,thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q179,you are expecting her again you say this morning,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q180,almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q181,something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q182,highbury gossips tiresome wretches,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q183,harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q184,i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q185,indeed how so of what sort,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q186,a very serious sort i assure you,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q187,very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q188,i have reason to think that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q189,he is very obliging but is he sure that harriet means to marry him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q190,well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q191,pray mr knightley how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q192,certainly i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q193,come i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q194,then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q195,oh to be sure it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q196,nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q197,i saw her answer nothing could be clearer,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q198,you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q199,and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q200,not harriet s equal no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q201,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q202,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q203,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q204,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q205,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q206,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q207,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q208,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q209,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q210,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q211,robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q212,depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q213,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q214,good morning to you,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q215,why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q216,i do not offer it for miss smith s collection being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q221,or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q222,mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q223,for miss read miss smith,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q224,that is court,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q225,that is ship plain as it can be now for the cream,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q226,courtship you know,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q227,a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q228,there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q229,dear miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q230,whatever you say is always right and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q231,i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q232,it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q233,when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q234,a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q235,that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q236,this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q237,yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q238,i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q239,i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q240,i never read one more to the purpose certainly,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q241,it is as long again as almost all we have had before,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q242,i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q243,it is one thing to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q244,such sweet lines these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q245,leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q246,oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q247,leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q248,oh but those two lines are,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q249,the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q250,i shall never let that book go out of my own hands,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q251,very well a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q252,my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q253,oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q254,well my dears how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q255,yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q256,aye that s very just indeed that s very properly said very true,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q257,it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody could have written so prettily but you emma,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q258,ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q259,yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q260,aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q261,the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q262,oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know why should there be any change,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q263,i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q264,she will not be surprized papa at least,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q265,i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q266,we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q267,yes my dear if there is time but,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q268,she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q269,it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q270,it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q271,but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q272,ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q273,harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q274,aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q275,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not,Harriet Smith,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q276,henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q277,and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q278,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q279,and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q280,but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q281,well i cannot understand it,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q282,that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q283,oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q284,you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q285,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q286,there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q287,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q288,i do not often walk this way now but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q289,i wish we could contrive it but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q290,i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q291,my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q292,ah so you say but i cannot believe it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q293,i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q294,is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q295,dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q296,i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q297,but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q298,that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q299,but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q300,never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q301,dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q302,if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q303,do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q304,oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q305,these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q306,very true poor creatures one can think of nothing else,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q307,and really i do not think the impression will soon be over i do not think it will,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q308,oh dear no,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q309,ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q310,oh dear yes,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q311,to fall in with each other on such an errand as this to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else,Emma,[]
Q312,this would soon have led to something better of course any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away,Emma,[]
Q313,part of my lace is gone and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q314,cautious very cautious he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure,Emma,[]
Q315,ah my dear poor miss taylor it is a grievous business,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q316,oh yes sir how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q317,pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q318,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q319,very much to the honour of both,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q320,and do you see her sir tolerably often,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q321,not near so often my dear as i could wish,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q322,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q323,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q324,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q325,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q326,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q327,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q328,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q329,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q330,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q331,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q332,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q333,but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q334,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q335,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q336,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q337,if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q338,to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q339,yes and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q340,a material difference then and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q341,yes a good deal nearer,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q342,but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q343,i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q344,that s true very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q345,a man cannot be more so,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q346,ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q347,how d ye do george,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q348,john how are you,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q349,my poor dear isabella how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q350,it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion of the sea air,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q351,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q352,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q353,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q354,oh good mr perry how is he sir,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q355,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q356,and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q357,i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella s throat,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q358,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q359,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q360,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q361,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q362,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q363,how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q364,that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q365,no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q366,ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q367,no indeed we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q368,ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q369,i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q370,middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q371,what is the matter sir did you speak to me,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q372,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q373,my dear isabella pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q374,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong,Emma,"['Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q375,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q376,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q377,i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q378,ah,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q379,i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q380,but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q381,and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q382,i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q383,you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable you should have consulted perry,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q384,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q385,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q386,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q387,if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q388,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q389,a sore throat i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risks why does not perry see her,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q390,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q391,very cold certainly very cold,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q392,you do quite right we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q393,well this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her,Emma,['Emma']
Q394,i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works,Mr. John Knightley,['Emma']
Q395,mr elton s manners are not perfect but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value,Emma,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q396,yes he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you,Mr. John Knightley,['Emma']
Q397,me are you imagining me to be mr elton s object,Emma,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q398,such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now,Mr. John Knightley,['Emma']
Q399,mr elton in love with me what an idea,Emma,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q400,i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do,Mr. John Knightley,['Emma']
Q401,i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more,Emma,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q402,a man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home,Mr. John Knightley,['Emma']
Q403,my report from mrs goddard s was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was my answer,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q404,oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q405,my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q406,yes i imagined that is i did not,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q407,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day,Emma,"['Mr. Elton', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q408,dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q409,what an excellent device the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q410,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it,Mr. John Knightley,"['Mr. Elton', 'Emma']"
Q411,christmas weather quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q412,i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls,Mr. John Knightley,"['Mr. Elton', 'Emma']"
Q413,we are sure of excellent fires and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q414,i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine with any body,Mr. John Knightley,"['Mr. Elton', 'Emma']"
Q415,indeed,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q416,i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q417,my first enjoyment will be to find myself safe at hartfield again,Mr. John Knightley,"['Mr. Elton', 'Emma']"
Q418,can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable,Emma,[]
Q419,my son frank my son,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q420,we want only two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more here your pretty little friend miss smith and my son and then i should say we were quite complete i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q421,he has been wanting to come to us ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q422,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself,Emma,['Mr. Weston']
Q423,yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q424,has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q425,i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe,Emma,['Mr. Weston']
Q426,yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q427,for i cannot depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q428,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q429,my emma what is the certainty of caprice,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q430,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Isabella']"
Q431,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q432,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q433,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q434,he ought to come if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q435,one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q436,but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q437,my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q438,i shall not be satisfied unless he comes,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q439,he may have a great deal of influence on some points and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q440,so scrupulous for others and yet so careless for herself she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself is this fair mrs weston judge between us have not i some right to complain i am sure of your kind support and aid,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q441,this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q442,i admired your resolution very much sir in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q443,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q444,you had better order the carriage directly my love i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold,Isabella,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. John Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q445,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Isabella', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q446,your father will not be easy why do not you go,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q447,i am ready if the others are,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q448,shall i ring the bell,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q449,yes do,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q450,i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q451,miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q452,mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q453,it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q454,good heaven what can be the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no i am sure you have seen and understood me,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q455,charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q456,no sir it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought seriously of her,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q457,never madam never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received,Mr. Elton,['Emma']
Q458,encouragement i give you encouragement sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting i have no thoughts of matrimony at present,Emma,['Mr. Elton']
Q459,if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet,Emma,[]
Q460,here have i actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer,Emma,[]
Q461,ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton,Mr. Woodhouse,['Mr. Knightley']
Q462,the churchills are very likely in fault but i dare say he might come if he would,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q463,i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q464,i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q465,how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q466,i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q467,that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q468,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q469,yes sometimes he can,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q470,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q471,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q472,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q473,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q474,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q475,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q476,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q477,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q478,our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q479,we shall never agree about him but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q480,yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q481,your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q482,i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q483,you seem determined to think ill of him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q484,me not at all i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q485,well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q486,you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q487,my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q488,and mine is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q489,i will say no more about him you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q490,prejudiced i am not prejudiced,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q491,but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q492,he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q493,mr elton is so good to the poor,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q494,oh yes mr elton i understand certainly as to dancing mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can and so she began inquiring after her directly saying,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q495,and when i immediately said,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q496,i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q497,said she,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q498,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well,Emma,"['Mrs. Bates', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q499,thank you you are so kind oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q500,you are extremely kind you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q501,my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q502,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q503,oh yes next week,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q504,indeed that must be a very great pleasure,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q505,thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q506,yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q507,so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q508,you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q509,very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q510,but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q511,yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q512,i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q513,oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q514,yes that of course,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q515,jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q516,it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q517,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q518,which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q519,i am afraid we must be running away my father will be expecting us i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q520,she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q521,a very pleasant evening particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q522,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q523,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q524,no you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q525,miss fairfax is reserved,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q526,i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q527,you think her diffident i do not see it,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q528,my dear emma you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q529,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q530,i am disappointed,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q531,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q532,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q533,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q534,it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q535,my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q536,that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q537,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q538,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q539,no not at randalls i have not been near randalls,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q540,oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be married,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q541,there is my news i thought it would interest you,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Miss Bates']"
Q542,but where could you hear it where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins that s all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q543,i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Miss Bates']"
Q544,well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q545,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q546,oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q547,well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q548,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Miss Bates']"
Q549,he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Miss Bates']"
Q550,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness,Emma,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q551,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q552,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q553,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q554,who shall answer that question my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind,Emma,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q555,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q556,i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q557,as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks,Emma,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q558,you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins,Emma,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q559,when i have seen mr elton i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q560,yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q561,quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q562,very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q563,handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he was plain,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q564,my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q565,oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates']"
Q566,well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q567,oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q568,dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q569,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q570,very true would not think about it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q571,this is too bad and now we shall just miss them too provoking i do not know when i have been so disappointed,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q572,how d ye do how d ye do we have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well frank comes to morrow i had a letter this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty he is at oxford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q573,i shall soon bring him over to hartfield,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q574,we had better move on mr weston we are detaining the girls,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q575,well well i am ready,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q576,but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q577,think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q578,four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q579,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q580,my dear dear anxious friend always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon,Emma,[]
Q581,i told you yesterday i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q582,it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q583,elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q584,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q585,i hope i should know better no depend upon it that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q586,as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q587,to be sure we do mrs bates we passed her house i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q588,there is no necessity for my calling this morning another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q589,oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q590,i have heard her speak of the acquaintance she is a very elegant young woman,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q591,yes,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q592,if you were never particularly struck by her manners before i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q593,you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q594,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q595,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q596,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q597,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q598,and how did you think miss fairfax looking,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q599,ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q600,it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q601,well there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q602,i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q603,did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q604,ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q605,oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q606,but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q607,i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q608,and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q609,upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q610,may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q611,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q612,yes,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q613,i believe i do,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q614,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q615,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q616,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q617,ever hear her you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q618,you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q619,proof indeed mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q620,yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q621,certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q622,it was her very particular friend you know,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q623,poor comfort one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q624,you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q625,so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q626,as to that i do not,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q627,oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q628,there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q629,i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q630,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q631,not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q632,all young people would have their little whims,Mrs. Weston,[]
Q633,all young people would have their little whims,Mrs. Weston,[]
Q634,hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for,Mr. Knightley,['Mr. Knightley']
Q635,i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q636,of course it must be declined,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q637,i am not fond of dinner visiting i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q638,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q639,you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q640,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q641,oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q642,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q643,and no great harm if it does the sooner every party breaks up the better,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q644,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q645,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q646,oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q647,i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly,Emma,['Emma']
Q648,this is coming as you should do like a gentleman i am quite glad to see you,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q649,how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q650,yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances now you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q651,nonsensical girl,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q652,one can suppose nothing else and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her,Mrs. Cole,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q653,i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening,Mrs. Cole,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q654,why do you smile,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q655,nay why do you,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q656,me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q657,very,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q658,i rather wonder that it was never made before,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q659,perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q660,or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q661,that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q662,you may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q663,i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q664,what do you say to mrs dixon,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q665,mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q666,if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon in them,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q667,mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q668,yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q669,and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q670,and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q671,he did i was there one of the party,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q672,were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q673,i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q674,the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q675,and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q676,no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q677,indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q678,i have made a most wretched discovery i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q679,perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q680,no that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q681,what is the matter,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q682,thank you for rousing me i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q683,this is the luxury of a large party one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bates and her niece came here,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q684,how they were invited were not they,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q685,oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q686,they walked i conclude how else could they come,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q687,very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q688,very likely nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q689,well you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q690,mr knightley and jane fairfax dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q691,my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q692,yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q693,nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q694,but the imprudence of such a match,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q695,i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q696,i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q697,imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q698,but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q699,my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q700,nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q701,well perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q702,if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q703,for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q704,then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q705,i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q706,very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q707,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q708,you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q709,i often feel concern that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q710,quite out of the question quite out of the question but you must often wish it i am sure,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q711,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q712,yes but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q713,that will do you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith', 'Mrs. Cole']"
Q714,i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith', 'Mrs. Cole']"
Q715,that fellow thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q716,miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Miss Bates']"
Q717,perhaps it is as well i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q718,oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q719,don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q720,oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q721,those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q722,well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q723,ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q724,are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q725,just as they always do very vulgar,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q726,they told me something but it is nothing of any consequence,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q727,they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q728,oh,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q729,he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q730,oh,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q731,they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q732,she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q733,she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q734,very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q735,for my companion tells me that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q736,and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q737,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q738,me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q739,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q740,well if you advise it but,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q741,if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q742,i do not believe any such thing i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q743,do come with me if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q744,should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am,Mrs. Ford,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q745,yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you,Harriet Smith,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q746,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q747,no more it is,Harriet Smith,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q748,no trouble in the world ma am,Mrs. Ford,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q749,oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise,Harriet Smith,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q750,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford,Emma,"['Harriet Smith', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q751,aye that will be much best i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s,Harriet Smith,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Ford']"
Q752,my dear miss woodhouse i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith how do you do miss smith very well i thank you and i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q753,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q754,very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse i am so glad to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q755,said i,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q756,said mr frank churchill,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q757,said i,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q758,said he,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q759,for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother s spectacles the rivet came out you know this morning so very obliging for my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q760,said i,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q761,then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always i have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us besides dear jane at present and she really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it i dare not let my mother know how little she eats so i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple dumplings however very often patty makes an excellent apple dumpling well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q762,how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Ford', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q763,what was i talking of,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q764,i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q765,said he,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q766,which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q767,said he,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q768,i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q769,said he directly,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q770,that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q771,said he,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q772,so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q773,pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q774,this is a pleasure coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q775,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q776,i have not been working uninterruptedly i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q777,whoever colonel campbell might employ the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q778,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q779,how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q780,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q781,conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q812,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q813,oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q814,said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very obliging of you,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q815,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q816,and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q817,oh no it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q818,is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing,Mr. Woodhouse,['Mrs. Weston']
Q819,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q820,it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q821,very true it was very bad,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q822,i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q823,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q824,there is no denying it i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q825,well miss woodhouse your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q826,the crown,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q827,yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q828,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q829,i was going to observe sir that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q830,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q831,from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q832,open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q833,ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q834,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q835,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q836,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q837,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q838,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q839,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q840,how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q841,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q842,my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q843,emma this paper is worse than i expected look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q844,my dear you are too particular what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club nights,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q845,i do not think it is so very small we shall not be many you know,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q846,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q847,i wish one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q848,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q849,well if you please if you think she will be of any use,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
Q850,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates,Emma,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q851,but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q852,aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both invite them both,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q853,both sir can the old lady,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q854,the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q855,oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q856,he has asked her my dear that s right i knew he would,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Weston']
Q857,very well if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me oh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkins s week s account much rather i confess pleasure in seeing dancing not i indeed i never look at it i do not know who does fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q858,oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q859,of all horrid things leave taking is the worst,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q860,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q861,ah,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q862,the uncertainty of when i may be able to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q863,our poor ball must be quite given up,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q864,ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q865,indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q866,if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q867,such a fortnight as it has been every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q868,as you do us such ample justice now i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q869,and you must be off this very morning,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q870,yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q871,not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q872,yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q873,in short perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q874,you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q875,it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q876,it was time to go,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q877,i shall hear about you all that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q878,i certainly must this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes,Emma,[]
Q879,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q880,i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more,Emma,[]
Q881,he is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily,Emma,[]
Q882,i must not dwell upon it i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure,Emma,[]
Q883,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q884,i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q885,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q886,there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet,Emma,['Emma']
Q887,elegantly dressed and very pleasing,Emma,[]
Q888,well miss woodhouse well miss woodhouse what do you think of her is not she very charming,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q889,oh yes very a very pleasing young woman,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q890,i think her beautiful quite beautiful,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q891,very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q892,i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q893,oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q894,i dare say i dare say she was very much attached to him,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q895,perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q896,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q897,my brother mr suckling s seat,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q898,and the staircase you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy months there,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q899,a charming place undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q900,so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q901,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q902,oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q903,yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q904,no i fancy not i never heard any county but surry called so,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q905,my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q906,no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q907,ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q908,many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q909,your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q910,my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q911,ah that s a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q912,i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q913,oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q914,said i,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q915,we cannot suppose that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q916,no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q917,but you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q918,i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q919,but every thing of that kind will soon be in so regular a train,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q920,well we shall see,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q921,we have been calling at randalls and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and she appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q922,having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q923,mrs weston s manners were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q924,and who do you think came in while we were there,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q925,knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q926,insufferable woman worse than i had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley i could not have believed it knightley never seen him in her life before and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind,Emma,[]
Q927,well my dear considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q928,i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q929,yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q930,but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q931,no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q932,well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies,Emma,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q933,my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry,Mr. Woodhouse,['Emma']
Q934,very pleasant and very elegantly dressed,Emma,[]
Q935,jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse i quite rave about jane fairfax a sweet interesting creature so mild and ladylike and with such talents i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax and her situation is so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,Mrs. Elton,['Emma']
Q936,we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax,Mrs. Elton,['Emma']
Q937,i cannot think there is any danger of it and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown,Emma,['Mrs. Elton']
Q938,oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express,Mrs. Elton,['Emma']
Q939,you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than,Emma,['Mrs. Elton']
Q940,my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties,Mrs. Elton,['Emma']
Q941,she is a riddle quite a riddle to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs elton s notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection,Emma,[]
Q942,she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere she is not to be with the dixons the decree is issued by somebody but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a separate puzzle,Emma,[]
Q943,we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q944,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q945,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q946,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q947,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q948,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q949,yes any body may know how highly i think of her,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q950,and yet and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q951,oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q952,that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q953,you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q954,so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q955,no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q956,no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q957,well and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q958,yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q959,in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau,Emma,"['Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q960,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q961,well mrs weston what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q962,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q963,i see how it is i see what a life i am to lead among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss,Mrs. Elton,[]
Q964,this is very true at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done,Emma,[]
Q965,i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet we scarcely got home in time i hope you turned directly,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q966,i went only to the post office and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q967,not a walk in the rain i should imagine,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q968,no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q969,that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q970,i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q971,indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q972,you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q973,i have often thought them the worst of the two business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q974,ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q975,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q976,i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings,Mr. Woodhouse,['Jane Fairfax']
Q977,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. Woodhouse']
Q978,my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well they are some of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to day i am sure my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield,Mr. Woodhouse,['Jane Fairfax']
Q979,my dear jane what is this i hear going to the post office in the rain this must not be i assure you you sad girl how could you do such a thing it is a sign i was not there to take care of you,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q980,oh do not tell me you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself to the post office indeed mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority,Mrs. Elton,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q981,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again,Mrs. Weston,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton']"
Q982,oh she shall not do such a thing again we will not allow her to do such a thing again there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation,Mrs. Elton,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q983,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before,Jane Fairfax,"['Mrs. Elton', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q984,my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is,Mrs. Elton,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q985,as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled,Mrs. Elton,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q986,excuse me i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama s,Jane Fairfax,"['Mrs. Elton', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q987,oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness to employ our men,Mrs. Elton,"['Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q988,the post office is a wonderful establishment the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q989,it is certainly very well regulated,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q990,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder,Jane Fairfax,['Mr. John Knightley']
Q991,the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well,Mr. John Knightley,['Jane Fairfax']
Q992,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q993,yes there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q994,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q995,i never saw any gentleman s handwriting,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q996,mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q997,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q998,if we were in the other room if i had my writing desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q999,he chose to say he was employed,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1000,well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1001,oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1002,must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1003,here is april come i get quite anxious about you june will soon be here,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1004,but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1005,but have you really heard of nothing,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1006,i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1007,oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1008,i not aware dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1009,but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1010,colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1011,trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1012,thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1013,but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1014,excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1015,oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1016,i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1017,something that would do aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1018,you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1019,i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1020,you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am,Jane Fairfax,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1021,and i am quite serious too i assure you in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1022,here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature he is i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown how do you like it selina s choice handsome i think but i do not know whether it is not over trimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will look well,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1023,i could not have believed it even of him,Mr. John Knightley,[]
Q1024,read it read it it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1025,well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1026,i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1027,you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1028,oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1029,you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1030,and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1031,i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1032,aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1033,indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1034,yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1035,yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1036,the evil of the distance from enscombe is that mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1037,no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1038,depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1039,oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1040,is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1041,mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill s illness,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1042,if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath or to clifton,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1043,she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1044,aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1045,frank was here in february for a fortnight,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1046,so i remember to have heard he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1047,my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1048,when frank left us it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1049,very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1050,you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1051,and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1052,i hope i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1053,only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before him i believe at least i am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1054,well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1055,i rather hope to satisfy you both for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1056,and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1057,that is very likely you think so do not you,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1058,i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1059,increase,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1060,certainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1061,difference no indeed i am not,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1062,there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1063,yes it is randalls that does it all,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1064,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home,Mr. John Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley']"
Q1065,no that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1066,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts,Emma,"['Mr. Knightley', 'Mr. John Knightley']"
Q1067,i think she must be here soon i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her it cannot be long i think before she comes,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1068,i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1069,but miss bates and miss fairfax we thought you were to bring them,Mr. Weston,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Emma', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Elton', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q1071,a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Weston']
Q1072,i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of them,Mrs. Elton,['Mrs. Weston']

Q1074,how do you like my gown how do you like my trimming how has wright done my hair,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1075,nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand we shall see if our styles suit a fine young man certainly is frank churchill i like him very well,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']

Q1101,and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']

Q1116,now you must recollect,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1117,no indeed i do not,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1118,dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1119,my dearest harriet you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well go on what else,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1120,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1121,and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1122,lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this,Emma,['Emma']
Q1123,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1124,this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1125,i do remember it i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1126,ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1127,well go on,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1128,oh that s all i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1129,my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1130,yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1131,but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1132,i shall be happier to burn it it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton,Harriet Smith,['Emma']

Q1137,i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1138,mr elton indeed oh no so superior to mr elton,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1139,harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1140,oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1141,i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1142,service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1143,it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1144,by the bye what became of mr perry s plan of setting up his carriage,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1145,i did not know that he ever had any such plan,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1146,nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1147,me impossible,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1148,indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q1152,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1153,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1154,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed,Miss Bates,"['Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q1170,i am glad you approve of what i have done but i thought you would such schemes as these are nothing without numbers one cannot have too large a party a large party secures its own amusement and she is a good natured woman after all one could not leave her out,Mr. Weston,['Emma']

Q1260,you were speaking,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1261,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill', 'Mr. Weston', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Miss Bates', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q1270,nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1271,i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1272,oh i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1273,they are blended i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']

Q1278,said i,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1279,for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1280,but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room i want her to lie down upon the bed,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"

Q1291,to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1292,mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1293,yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1294,you spent the evening with mrs elton,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1295,yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1296,said she,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1297,mr knightley was there too was he,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1298,no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1299,miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1300,i dare say she had,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1301,whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1302,thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1303,ah madam if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1304,you are so noble in your ideas,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1305,and when is miss fairfax to leave you,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1306,very soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1307,her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return,Emma,"['Miss Bates', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1308,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1309,aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s,Miss Bates,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates']"
Q1310,i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1311,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,Emma,"['Mr. Woodhouse', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1312,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time,Mr. Knightley,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1313,well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Mr. Knightley', 'Harriet Smith']"
Q1314,i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long,Mr. Woodhouse,"['Emma', 'Harriet Smith']"

Q1329,upon my honour it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley,Mr. Weston,['Emma']
Q1330,i was wrong in talking of its being broke to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls,Mr. Weston,['Emma']

Q1336,well my dear i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me,Mr. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q1337,i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1338,what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1339,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1340,so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1341,you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1342,he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1343,more than an attachment indeed an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1344,jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1345,you may well be amazed you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1346,well this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1347,engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally some part of his conduct we cannot excuse,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1348,i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1349,that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1350,mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1351,i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1352,from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1353,and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1354,there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1355,impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1356,nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1357,good god mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1358,he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1359,i am to hear from him soon he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1360,his sufferings do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1361,most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1362,ah he would have done as much for harriet,Emma,[]
Q1363,this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates s i fancy some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour he was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1364,and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1365,none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1366,well i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1367,i am quite easy on that head i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1368,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1369,true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1370,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Weston']"
Q1371,much indeed if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that,Emma,"['Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q1372,a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter,Emma,"['Mr. Weston', 'Mrs. Weston']"
Q1373,harriet poor harriet,Emma,[]
Q1374,but with common sense i am afraid i have had little to do,Emma,[]
Q1375,well miss woodhouse is not this the oddest news that ever was,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1376,what news do you mean,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1377,about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1378,what did mr weston tell you,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1379,oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1380,had you any idea of his being in love with her you perhaps might you who can see into every body s heart but nobody else,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1381,upon my word i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1382,me why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1383,i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1384,him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1385,harriet what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1386,i should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1387,harriet let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1388,to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1389,not quite for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1390,oh miss woodhouse how you do forget,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1391,my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1392,oh dear now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1393,good god this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what is to be done,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1394,you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1395,i do not wonder miss woodhouse that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1396,have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1397,yes i must say that i have,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1398,might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1399,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1400,i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful,Harriet Smith,['Emma']
Q1401,harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does,Emma,['Harriet Smith']
Q1402,oh god that i had never seen her,Emma,[]
Q1403,on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months she was energetic this was one of her expressions and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1404,poor girl she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1405,wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1406,said she,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1407,she continued,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1408,poor girl she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1409,yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1410,i am afraid that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1411,on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear said she she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1412,if i did not know her to be happy now which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1413,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1414,are you well my emma,Mrs. Weston,['Emma']
Q1415,oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible,Emma,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1416,you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1417,have i of what nature,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1418,oh the best nature in the world a wedding,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1419,if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1420,how is it possible,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1421,i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1422,you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but i seem to have been doomed to blindness,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1423,time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1424,the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1425,he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her she deserves a better fate,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1426,you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1427,emma are you indeed no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1428,mr knightley i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1429,i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1430,i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1431,i have no doubt of their being happy together i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1432,he is a most fortunate man so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1433,you speak as if you envied him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1434,and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1435,you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but i cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1436,oh then don t speak it don t speak it take a little time consider do not commit yourself,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1437,thank you you are going in i suppose,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1438,no i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1439,i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1440,as a friend emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1441,my dearest emma for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1442,you are silent absolutely silent at present i ask no more,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1443,i cannot make speeches emma if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1444,i shall be very glad to look it over but it seems long i will take it home with me at night,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1445,i would rather be talking to you but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1446,had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1447,humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1448,it will be natural for me to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1449,not at all i should wish it,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1450,he trifles here as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1451,and i have not forgotten how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1452,i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had you not been in the case i should still have distrusted him,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1453,very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1454,you had better go on,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1455,the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1456,i perfectly agree with you sir you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1457,this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1458,there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1459,nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1460,i hope he does smallridge what does this mean what is all this,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1461,she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1462,say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1463,i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1464,well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1465,i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1466,come he knows himself there,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1467,those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1468,you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1469,yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1470,ah there is one difficulty unprovided for i am sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent before you ask mine,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']

Q1475,upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short time oh if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worst,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax']"
Q1476,we do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsor oh no perry shall have all the credit,Mrs. Elton,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1477,i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse since the party to box hill very pleasant party but yet i think there was something wanting things did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax']"

Q1488,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday,Emma,"['Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1489,oh no the meeting is certainly to day,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1490,i do believe this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1491,your parish there was small,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1492,upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1493,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1494,ah you clever creature that s very true what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection not that i presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already but hush not a word if you please,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1495,very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1496,when i got to donwell knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1497,donwell my dear mr e you have not been to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1498,no no that s to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields too,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1499,which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you explain it,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1500,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it,Mrs. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Miss Bates', 'Mr. Elton']"
Q1501,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose,Mr. Elton,"['Emma', 'Mrs. Bates', 'Jane Fairfax', 'Mrs. Elton', 'Miss Bates']"
Q1502,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1503,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q1504,oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1505,you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q1506,pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1507,very,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q1508,and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1509,oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q1510,nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps but excuse me it must be thought of,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1511,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for,Jane Fairfax,['Emma']
Q1512,thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open good bye good bye,Emma,['Jane Fairfax']
Q1513,she has had the advantage you know of practising on me like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1514,that is she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1515,poor child at that rate what will become of her,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1516,nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1517,but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1518,do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1519,i am sure you were of use to me i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1520,how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1521,what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1522,mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1523,i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1524,and cannot you call me george now,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1525,impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1526,john does not even mention your friend here is his answer if you like to see it,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1527,john enters like a brother into my happiness but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1528,he writes like a sensible man i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1529,my emma he means no such thing he only means,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1530,he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1531,emma my dear emma,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1532,oh if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1533,ah i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1534,if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1535,yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1536,those matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1537,it is to be a secret i conclude these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them only let me be told when i may speak out i wonder whether jane has any suspicion,Mr. Weston,['Mrs. Weston']
Q1538,rather he than i,Mr. Elton,['Mrs. Elton']
Q1539,poor knightley poor fellow sad business for him,Mrs. Elton,['Mr. Elton']
Q1540,i have something to tell you emma some news,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1541,good or bad,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1542,i do not know which it ought to be called,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1543,oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1544,i am afraid i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1545,indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1546,there is one subject i hope but one on which we do not think alike does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1547,have you heard from her yourself this morning you have i believe and know the whole,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1548,no i have not i know nothing pray tell me,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1549,you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1550,it is so indeed i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1551,you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1552,you mistake me you quite mistake me it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1553,i mean that he has done it and been accepted,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1554,good god well,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1555,well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1556,it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1557,emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1558,you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1559,you ought to know your friend best but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1560,upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1561,do you dare say this do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1562,oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1563,i am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1564,i am perfectly satisfied and most sincerely wish them happy,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1565,you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1566,i hope so for at that time i was a fool,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1567,and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for,Mr. Knightley,['Emma']
Q1568,me ah poor harriet,Emma,['Mr. Knightley']
Q1569,it is frank and miss fairfax i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope,Mrs. Weston,"['Emma', 'Mr. Woodhouse']"
Q1570,i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs weston s letters i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you then said,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1571,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1572,is not she looking well better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1573,i can never think of it without extreme shame,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1574,the shame is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1575,i never had the smallest i assure you,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1576,that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1577,it is not now worth a regret,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1578,i have some hope of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1579,ah by the bye i hope mr knightley is well i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1580,did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1581,i have always admired her complexion but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1582,oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1583,i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1584,oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1585,not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1586,if not in our dispositions there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1587,true true no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1588,very beautiful indeed,Emma,['Mr. Frank Churchill']
Q1589,how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come,Mr. Frank Churchill,['Emma']
Q1590,perry my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax']"
Q1591,such an extraordinary dream of mine i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others,Mr. Frank Churchill,"['Emma', 'Jane Fairfax']"
Q1592,how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me they will sometimes obtrude but how you can court them,Jane Fairfax,"['Emma', 'Mr. Frank Churchill']"
