p00006_A,00006,A,perhaps but later
p00007_A,00007,A,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00008_A,00008,A,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00009_A,00009,A,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please

p00011_A,00011,A,why no there are six people present in my small room already please remain seated if you will excuse the informality
p00012_A,00012,A,cyril again you desert
p00013_A,00013,A,my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke
p00014_A,00014,A,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00015_A,00015,A,but not in an indian state
p00016_A,00016,A,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00017_A,00017,A,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00018_A,00018,A,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00019_A,00019,A,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00020_A,00020,A,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00021_A,00021,A,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00022_A,00022,A,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00023_A,00023,A,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00024_A,00024,A,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00025_A,00025,A,do not apologize you are always late
p00026_A,00026,A,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00027_A,00027,A,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00028_A,00028,A,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00029_A,00029,A,come and see my wife a little then
p00030_A,00030,A,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00031_A,00031,A,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00032_A,00032,A,some case i daresay
p00033_A,00033,A,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00034_A,00034,A,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00035_A,00035,A,aziz he is trying to pull your leg don t believe him the villain
p00036_A,00036,A,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00037_A,00037,A,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00038_A,00038,A,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00039_A,00039,A,oh that is going much too far
p00040_A,00040,A,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00041_A,00041,A,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00042_A,00042,A,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00043_A,00043,A,when miss quested stopped in the college fielding used to visit her rather too late in the evening the servants say
p00044_A,00044,A,but you understand my meaning
p00045_A,00045,A,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00046_A,00046,A,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00047_A,00047,A,no let us surprise them without warning far too much nonsense still goes on among our ladies they pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah indeed those of them who can write composed a document to that effect and now it ends in humbug you know how deeply they all respect fielding but not one of them has seen him my wife says she will but always when he calls there is some excuse she is not feeling well she is ashamed of the room she has no nice sweets to offer him only elephants ears and if i say elephants ears are mr fielding s favourite sweet she replies that he will know how badly hers are made so she cannot see him on their account for fifteen years my dear boy have i argued with my begum for fifteen years and never gained a point yet the missionaries inform us our women are down trodden if you want a subject for a poem take this the indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be
p00048_A,00048,A,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00049_A,00049,A,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00050_A,00050,A,why isn t cyril following let us turn back
p00051_A,00051,A,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00052_A,00052,A,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00053_A,00053,A,they are torturing him
p00054_A,00054,A,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00055_A,00055,A,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00056_A,00056,A,well look at my own experience this morning
p00057_A,00057,A,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00058_A,00058,A,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00059_A,00059,A,did you not know that when they were lent to central india over a canal scheme some rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in solid gold so that the water should run through his state
p00060_A,00060,A,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00061_A,00061,A,queen victoria was different
p00062_A,00062,A,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00063_A,00063,A,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00064_A,00064,A,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00065_A,00065,A,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00066_A,00066,A,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00067_A,00067,A,and does it
p00068_A,00068,A,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00069_A,00069,A,no no i do not admit that i have met others
p00070_A,00070,A,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00071_A,00071,A,she said in the most natural way she offered me a lozenge when the dust irritated my throat
p00072_A,00072,A,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00073_A,00073,A,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00074_A,00074,A,mrs lesley it is a tonga
p00075_A,00075,A,o tonga wallah club club why doesn t the fool go
p00076_A,00076,A,i say is he ill or isn t he ill
p00077_A,00077,A,saying nothing then i will write him a letter tell him i have called that is sufficient here is my card call me a tonga
p00078_A,00078,A,huzoor all are at the club
p00079_A,00079,A,madam madam madam
p00080_A,00080,A,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00081_A,00081,A,you have
p00082_A,00082,A,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00083_A,00083,A,of course but so few ladies take the trouble especially if thinking no one is there to see
p00084_A,00084,A,oh can i do you some service now or at any time
p00085_A,00085,A,may i know your name
p00086_A,00086,A,mrs mrs moore i am afraid i startled you i shall tell my community our friends about you that god is here very good very fine indeed i think you are newly arrived in india
p00087_A,00087,A,by the way you address me no but can i call you a carriage
p00088_A,00088,A,what was the name of the play
p00089_A,00089,A,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00090_A,00090,A,oh i am used to it
p00091_A,00091,A,i m a doctor snakes don t dare bite me please may i ask you a question now why do you come to india at this time of year just as the cold weather is ending
p00092_A,00092,A,it will soon be so unhealthy for you and why ever do you come to chandrapore
p00093_A,00093,A,oh no excuse me that is quite impossible our city magistrate s name is mr heaslop i know him intimately
p00094_A,00094,A,but mrs moore how can he be
p00095_A,00095,A,yes now i see and your first husband died
p00096_A,00096,A,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00097_A,00097,A,and the gentleman here is he ralph and stella s half brother
p00098_A,00098,A,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance

p00100_A,00100,A,would you care to see over the minto hospital one morning i have nothing else to offer at chandrapore
p00101_A,00101,A,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00102_A,00102,A,ah a very charming lady
p00103_A,00103,A,what what you didn t like her
p00104_A,00104,A,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00105_A,00105,A,there honestly is none we are by nature a most informal people
p00106_A,00106,A,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00107_A,00107,A,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00108_A,00108,A,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00109_A,00109,A,how is that oh explain to me
p00110_A,00110,A,do you ever remember our mosque mrs moore
p00111_A,00111,A,and how rough and rude i was and how good you were
p00112_A,00112,A,certainly miss quested so you and i will go together and leave mrs moore here and we will not be long yet we will not hurry because we know that will be her wish
p00113_A,00113,A,dear mrs moore what does anything matter so long as you are my guests i am very glad you are not coming which sounds strange but you are treating me with true frankness as a friend yes i am your friend so may i make another suggestion don t let so many people come with you this time i think you may find it more convenient exactly exactly is that all right
p00114_A,00114,A,oh oh
p00115_A,00115,A,i have taken them off
p00116_A,00116,A,i left them at the entrance

p00123_A,00123,A,cousin kate
p00124_A,00124,A,but you walk about yourself
p00125_A,00125,A,used to snakes
p00126_A,00126,A,i intended to start earlier but there was an unavoidable delay
p00127_A,00127,A,to visit my son he is the city magistrate here
p00128_A,00128,A,he s my son all the same
p00129_A,00129,A,i was married twice
p00130_A,00130,A,he did and so did my second husband
p00131_A,00131,A,no there are the younger ones ralph and stella in england
p00132_A,00132,A,quite right
p00133_A,00133,A,what are their names not also ronny ralph and stella surely
p00134_A,00134,A,i do
p00135_A,00135,A,thank you i have seen it already or i should have liked to come with you very much
p00136_A,00136,A,yes and mrs callendar
p00137_A,00137,A,possibly when one knows her better
p00138_A,00138,A,she was certainly intending to be kind but i did not find her exactly charming
p00139_A,00139,A,i don t think i understand people very well i only know whether i like or dislike them
p00140_A,00140,A,i am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence
p00141_A,00141,A,india s oh what an alarming idea
p00142_A,00142,A,rupees don t last for ever i m afraid
p00143_A,00143,A,good bye dr aziz
p00144_A,00144,A,get in get in you ll kill yourself as well as mr fielding i see no ruin
p00145_A,00145,A,i do i do
p00146_A,00146,A,and how happy we both were
p00147_A,00147,A,quite right i m sorry not to come too but i m a poor walker
p00148_A,00148,A,aziz where have you put miss quested to
p00149_A,00149,A,i want to see the real india
p00150_A,00150,A,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00151_A,00151,A,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00152_A,00152,A,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00153_A,00153,A,was he nice
p00154_A,00154,A,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00155_A,00155,A,and nasty
p00156_A,00156,A,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00157_A,00157,A,i suppose so
p00158_A,00158,A,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00159_A,00159,A,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00160_A,00160,A,what made you call it a ghost
p00161_A,00161,A,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00162_A,00162,A,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00163_A,00163,A,what a nice cheerful servant what a relief after antony
p00164_A,00164,A,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00165_A,00165,A,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00166_A,00166,A,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00167_A,00167,A,oh yes that s true
p00168_A,00168,A,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00169_A,00169,A,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00170_A,00170,A,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00171_A,00171,A,a snake it isn t a snake
p00172_A,00172,A,mrs moore may i put our difficulty to dr aziz i mean our anglo indian one
p00173_A,00173,A,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00174_A,00174,A,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00175_A,00175,A,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00176_A,00176,A,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00177_A,00177,A,i can t get rid of it
p00178_A,00178,A,mrs moore what is this echo
p00179_A,00179,A,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00180_A,00180,A,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00181_A,00181,A,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00182_A,00182,A,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00183_A,00183,A,i know but
p00184_A,00184,A,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00185_A,00185,A,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00186_A,00186,A,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00187_A,00187,A,ah yes so the young man there said
p00188_A,00188,A,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00189_A,00189,A,i believe that you have oh please it distresses me beyond words
p00190_A,00190,A,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00191_A,00191,A,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00192_A,00192,A,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00193_A,00193,A,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00194_A,00194,A,that s much the best feeling to have
p00195_A,00195,A,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00196_A,00196,A,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00197_A,00197,A,india s
p00198_A,00198,A,call what a ghost
p00199_A,00199,A,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00200_A,00200,A,we shall be all moslems together now as you promised
p00201_A,00201,A,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00202_A,00202,A,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00203_A,00203,A,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00204_A,00204,A,she has children you see
p00205_A,00205,A,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00206_A,00206,A,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00207_A,00207,A,only various shades of the dark
p00208_A,00208,A,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00209_A,00209,A,i forget
p00210_A,00210,A,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00211_A,00211,A,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00212_A,00212,A,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00213_A,00213,A,oh what of the echo
p00214_A,00214,A,i don t suppose you ever will
p00215_A,00215,A,don t you know
p00216_A,00216,A,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00217_A,00217,A,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00218_A,00218,A,i never said his name
p00219_A,00219,A,of course he is innocent
p00220_A,00220,A,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00221_A,00221,A,come india s not as bad as all that other side of the earth if you like but we stick to the same old moon
p00222_A,00222,A,listen mohammed latif says good morning next
p00223_A,00223,A,fielding how s one to see the real india
p00224_A,00224,A,i say old man do excuse me but i think perhaps you oughtn t to have left miss quested alone
p00225_A,00225,A,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p00226_A,00226,A,yes that s all right in england
p00227_A,00227,A,if you can t see you can t see can t you see that fellow s a bounder
p00228_A,00228,A,what should have upset his precious nerves
p00229_A,00229,A,well it s nothing i ve said i never even spoke to him
p00230_A,00230,A,fielding don t think i m taking it badly or anything of that sort i suppose you won t come on to the polo with us we should all be delighted
p00231_A,00231,A,let him go
p00232_A,00232,A,i came to bring miss quested away but her visit to the turtons has ended and there is no other arrangement so far mine are bachelor quarters now
p00233_A,00233,A,i wish to thank you for the help you have given miss quested she will not of course trespass on your hospitality further she has as a matter of fact decided to return to england i have just arranged about her passage for her i understand she would like to see you
p00234_A,00234,A,who was that
p00235_A,00235,A,yes indeed
p00236_A,00236,A,our schoolmaster government college
p00237_A,00237,A,das is really
p00238_A,00238,A,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00239_A,00239,A,oh lucky you
p00240_A,00240,A,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00241_A,00241,A,let me explain natives don t respect one any the more after meeting one you see
p00242_A,00242,A,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00243_A,00243,A,that occurs after so many meetings
p00244_A,00244,A,even from one s patients
p00245_A,00245,A,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00246_A,00246,A,how if he went to heaven
p00247_A,00247,A,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00248_A,00248,A,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00249_A,00249,A,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00250_A,00250,A,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00251_A,00251,A,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p00252_A,00252,A,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00253_A,00253,A,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00254_A,00254,A,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00255_A,00255,A,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00256_A,00256,A,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00257_A,00257,A,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00258_A,00258,A,to work mary to work
p00259_A,00259,A,come along mary get it over
p00260_A,00260,A,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00261_A,00261,A,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00262_A,00262,A,everything absolutely normal
p00263_A,00263,A,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00264_A,00264,A,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p00265_A,00265,A,she s saying her prayers
p00266_A,00266,A,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00267_A,00267,A,you won t
p00268_A,00268,A,mcbryde s an old woman
p00269_A,00269,A,miss quested what a name
p00270_A,00270,A,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00271_A,00271,A,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00272_A,00272,A,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00273_A,00273,A,harry is there any news from the city
p00274_A,00274,A,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00275_A,00275,A,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00276_A,00276,A,miss quested adela what d ye call yourself it s half past seven we ought to think of starting for that court when you feel inclined
p00277_A,00277,A,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00278_A,00278,A,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00279_A,00279,A,it s decent of the burra sahib do you know he s never given a bridge party before coming on top of the dinner too i wish i could have arranged something myself but when you know the natives better you ll realize it s easier for the burra sahib than for me they know him they know he can t be fooled i m still fresh comparatively no one can even begin to think of knowing this country until he has been in it twenty years hullo the mater here s your cloak well for an example of the mistakes one makes soon after i came out i asked one of the pleaders to have a smoke with me only a cigarette mind i found afterwards that he had sent touts all over the bazaar to announce the fact told all the litigants ever since then i ve dropped on him in court as hard as i could it s taught me a lesson and i hope him
p00280_A,00280,A,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00281_A,00281,A,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00282_A,00282,A,you oughtn t to have answered
p00283_A,00283,A,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00284_A,00284,A,what s happened to fielding where s my mother
p00285_A,00285,A,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00286_A,00286,A,what was that about caves
p00287_A,00287,A,out where
p00288_A,00288,A,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00289_A,00289,A,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00290_A,00290,A,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00291_A,00291,A,no but i know all about them naturally
p00292_A,00292,A,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00293_A,00293,A,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00294_A,00294,A,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00295_A,00295,A,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00296_A,00296,A,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00297_A,00297,A,as we are british i suppose it is
p00298_A,00298,A,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00299_A,00299,A,i know we shall
p00300_A,00300,A,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00301_A,00301,A,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00302_A,00302,A,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00303_A,00303,A,frightened adela
p00304_A,00304,A,wasn t the bridge we skidded
p00305_A,00305,A,i say adela what was it
p00306_A,00306,A,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00307_A,00307,A,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00308_A,00308,A,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00309_A,00309,A,dear old girl to say so
p00310_A,00310,A,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00311_A,00311,A,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00312_A,00312,A,well my dear girl this isn t much of a home coming i had no idea she had this up her sleeve
p00313_A,00313,A,you re over tired
p00314_A,00314,A,well sit down anyhow
p00315_A,00315,A,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00316_A,00316,A,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00317_A,00317,A,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00318_A,00318,A,heard what
p00319_A,00319,A,mother never said so
p00320_A,00320,A,she never mentioned that name once
p00321_A,00321,A,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00322_A,00322,A,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00323_A,00323,A,those words
p00324_A,00324,A,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00325_A,00325,A,you were not right she never said it
p00326_A,00326,A,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00327_A,00327,A,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00328_A,00328,A,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00329_A,00329,A,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00330_A,00330,A,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00331_A,00331,A,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00332_A,00332,A,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00333_A,00333,A,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00334_A,00334,A,good evening
p00335_A,00335,A,i thought there was to be no polo
p00336_A,00336,A,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00337_A,00337,A,the marabar caves
p00338_A,00338,A,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00339_A,00339,A,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00340_A,00340,A,have you been to them
p00341_A,00341,A,oh naturally
p00342_A,00342,A,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00343_A,00343,A,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00344_A,00344,A,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00345_A,00345,A,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00346_A,00346,A,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00347_A,00347,A,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00348_A,00348,A,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00349_A,00349,A,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00350_A,00350,A,i think we shall keep friends
p00351_A,00351,A,quite so
p00352_A,00352,A,good gracious no
p00353_A,00353,A,how do you do
p00354_A,00354,A,i think perhaps i ought to see your mother and discuss future plans
p00355_A,00355,A,a large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us
p00356_A,00356,A,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p00357_A,00357,A,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p00358_A,00358,A,what does our old gentleman of the car think
p00359_A,00359,A,have i really
p00360_A,00360,A,what animal
p00361_A,00361,A,can mrs moore be with me
p00362_A,00362,A,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00363_A,00363,A,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00364_A,00364,A,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00365_A,00365,A,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00366_A,00366,A,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00367_A,00367,A,my echo s better
p00368_A,00368,A,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00369_A,00369,A,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00370_A,00370,A,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00371_A,00371,A,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00372_A,00372,A,didn t she
p00373_A,00373,A,but ronny i heard her
p00374_A,00374,A,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00375_A,00375,A,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00376_A,00376,A,the idea more than the words
p00377_A,00377,A,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00378_A,00378,A,you see ronny i was right
p00379_A,00379,A,but she thinks it
p00380_A,00380,A,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00381_A,00381,A,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00382_A,00382,A,not allowed
p00383_A,00383,A,been there when
p00384_A,00384,A,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00385_A,00385,A,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00386_A,00386,A,who was he
p00387_A,00387,A,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00388_A,00388,A,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00389_A,00389,A,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00390_A,00390,A,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00391_A,00391,A,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00392_A,00392,A,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00393_A,00393,A,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00394_A,00394,A,yes rather i must in fact
p00395_A,00395,A,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00396_A,00396,A,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00397_A,00397,A,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00398_A,00398,A,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00399_A,00399,A,india isn t home
p00400_A,00400,A,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00401_A,00401,A,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00402_A,00402,A,i know
p00403_A,00403,A,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00404_A,00404,A,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00405_A,00405,A,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00406_A,00406,A,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00407_A,00407,A,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00408_A,00408,A,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00409_A,00409,A,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00410_A,00410,A,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00411_A,00411,A,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00412_A,00412,A,india likes gods
p00413_A,00413,A,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00414_A,00414,A,how do you make that out mother
p00415_A,00415,A,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00416_A,00416,A,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00417_A,00417,A,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00418_A,00418,A,look here both of you see india if you like and as you like i know i made myself rather ridiculous at fielding s but it s different now i wasn t quite sure of myself
p00419_A,00419,A,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00420_A,00420,A,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00421_A,00421,A,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00422_A,00422,A,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00423_A,00423,A,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00424_A,00424,A,we can go into that later can t we
p00425_A,00425,A,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00426_A,00426,A,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00427_A,00427,A,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00428_A,00428,A,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00429_A,00429,A,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00430_A,00430,A,who cares what she thinks
p00431_A,00431,A,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00432_A,00432,A,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00433_A,00433,A,feeble mother feeble
p00434_A,00434,A,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00435_A,00435,A,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00436_A,00436,A,between the acts
p00437_A,00437,A,can t mother
p00438_A,00438,A,very nice
p00439_A,00439,A,a doctor i don t know his name
p00440_A,00440,A,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00441_A,00441,A,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00442_A,00442,A,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00443_A,00443,A,aziz what a charming name
p00444_A,00444,A,yes quite after the first moment
p00445_A,00445,A,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00446_A,00446,A,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00447_A,00447,A,but my dear boy
p00448_A,00448,A,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00449_A,00449,A,how not true
p00450_A,00450,A,i don t know what you mean dear
p00451_A,00451,A,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00452_A,00452,A,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00453_A,00453,A,not talk about him why
p00454_A,00454,A,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00455_A,00455,A,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00456_A,00456,A,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00457_A,00457,A,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00458_A,00458,A,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00459_A,00459,A,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00460_A,00460,A,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00461_A,00461,A,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00462_A,00462,A,what do you mean
p00463_A,00463,A,your sentiments are those of a god
p00464_A,00464,A,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00465_A,00465,A,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00466_A,00466,A,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00467_A,00467,A,the desire to behave pleasantly satisfies god the sincere if impotent desire wins his blessing i think every one fails but there are so many kinds of failure good will and more good will and more good will though i speak with the tongues of
p00468_A,00468,A,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00469_A,00469,A,an accident
p00470_A,00470,A,a ghost
p00471_A,00471,A,here you are both back
p00472_A,00472,A,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00473_A,00473,A,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00474_A,00474,A,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00475_A,00475,A,why should i be in the witness box
p00476_A,00476,A,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00477_A,00477,A,i have changed my mind
p00478_A,00478,A,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00479_A,00479,A,i want my pack of patience cards
p00480_A,00480,A,red nine on black ten
p00481_A,00481,A,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00482_A,00482,A,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00483_A,00483,A,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00484_A,00484,A,most feeble
p00485_A,00485,A,it is owing to orders from the l g turton would never do this unless compelled those high officials are different they sympathize the viceroy sympathizes they would have us treated properly but they come too seldom and live too far away meanwhile
p00486_A,00486,A,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00487_A,00487,A,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00488_A,00488,A,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00489_A,00489,A,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00490_A,00490,A,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00491_A,00491,A,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p00492_A,00492,A,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00493_A,00493,A,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00494_A,00494,A,you will make yourself chip
p00495_A,00495,A,mr mahmoud ali
p00496_A,00496,A,mr ram chand
p00497_A,00497,A,it is only just five my husband will be up from his office in a moment and start the thing i have no idea what we have to do it s the first time we ve ever given a party like this at the club mr heaslop when i m dead and gone will you give parties like this it s enough to make the old type of burra sahib turn in his grave
p00498_A,00498,A,absolutely true
p00499_A,00499,A,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p00500_A,00500,A,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00501_A,00501,A,i didn t mean that
p00502_A,00502,A,well done das quite sound
p00503_A,00503,A,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00504_A,00504,A,you re superior to them anyway don t forget that you re superior to everyone in india except one or two of the ranis and they re on an equality is that what you wanted
p00505_A,00505,A,oh yes they re english speaking
p00506_A,00506,A,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00507_A,00507,A,i should think i did champagne too
p00508_A,00508,A,how about aspirin
p00509_A,00509,A,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00510_A,00510,A,yes my dear child
p00511_A,00511,A,this isn t a purdah party
p00512_A,00512,A,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00513_A,00513,A,but mrs turton
p00514_A,00514,A,oh really
p00515_A,00515,A,do kindly tell us who these ladies are
p00516_A,00516,A,perhaps we speak yours a little
p00517_A,00517,A,eastbourne piccadilly high park corner
p00518_A,00518,A,no of course not and anyhow they re not coming to the club
p00519_A,00519,A,she knows paris also
p00520_A,00520,A,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00521_A,00521,A,the shorter lady she is my wife she is mrs bhattacharya the taller lady she is my sister she is mrs das
p00522_A,00522,A,no of course not we are not such people
p00523_A,00523,A,whenever is convenient
p00524_A,00524,A,we shall enjoy it greatly it would be a real pleasure what about the time
p00525_A,00525,A,most certainly
p00526_A,00526,A,all hours
p00527_A,00527,A,we leave for calcutta to day
p00528_A,00528,A,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00529_A,00529,A,yes yes you come to us thursday
p00530_A,00530,A,but you ll be in calcutta
p00531_A,00531,A,you can t have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for our sake
p00532_A,00532,A,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00533_A,00533,A,much the best thing to be in this place
p00534_A,00534,A,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00535_A,00535,A,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00536_A,00536,A,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00537_A,00537,A,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday
p00538_A,00538,A,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00539_A,00539,A,i do so hate mysteries
p00540_A,00540,A,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00541_A,00541,A,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00542_A,00542,A,i don t know
p00543_A,00543,A,i shall walk
p00544_A,00544,A,ought i to join them
p00545_A,00545,A,but where am i to go in it
p00546_A,00546,A,a sort of interview have you any explanation of my extraordinary behaviour
p00547_A,00547,A,why indeed
p00548_A,00548,A,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00549_A,00549,A,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00550_A,00550,A,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00551_A,00551,A,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00552_A,00552,A,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00553_A,00553,A,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00554_A,00554,A,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00555_A,00555,A,will it
p00556_A,00556,A,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00557_A,00557,A,how can that be
p00558_A,00558,A,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00559_A,00559,A,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00560_A,00560,A,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00561_A,00561,A,because the dead don t live again
p00562_A,00562,A,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00563_A,00563,A,the guide
p00564_A,00564,A,perhaps it was the guide
p00565_A,00565,A,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00566_A,00566,A,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00567_A,00567,A,he may not even know i m here
p00568_A,00568,A,perfectly right
p00569_A,00569,A,mr fielding has ronny told you of this new misfortune ah me
p00570_A,00570,A,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00571_A,00571,A,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00572_A,00572,A,of course i ought to have thought of it myself my instincts never help me why didn t i rush up to him after the trial yes of course i will write him an apology but please will you dictate it shall i write another nothing matters if i can undo the harm i have caused i can do this right and that right but when the two are put together they come wrong that s the defect of my character i have never realized it until now i thought that if i was just and asked questions i would come through every difficulty
p00573_A,00573,A,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00574_A,00574,A,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00575_A,00575,A,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it
p00576_A,00576,A,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00577_A,00577,A,telepathy possibly
p00578_A,00578,A,i shall often you have been excessively kind now that i m going i realize it i wish i could do something for you in return but i see you ve all you want
p00579_A,00579,A,of course this death has been troubling me
p00580_A,00580,A,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00581_A,00581,A,so do i
p00582_A,00582,A,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00583_A,00583,A,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00584_A,00584,A,i m rather a hermit you know
p00585_A,00585,A,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00586_A,00586,A,do you care to meet one or two
p00587_A,00587,A,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00588_A,00588,A,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00589_A,00589,A,i won t ask the city magistrate to bring you i know he ll be busy at that time
p00590_A,00590,A,some misunderstanding
p00591_A,00591,A,i wouldn t worry about that
p00592_A,00592,A,that s a notion
p00593_A,00593,A,we english do
p00594_A,00594,A,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00595_A,00595,A,i suppose so
p00596_A,00596,A,good bye mrs moore
p00597_A,00597,A,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p00598_A,00598,A,you can t wander about like that where s the car you came in
p00599_A,00599,A,what madness there s supposed to be a riot on the police have struck no one knows what ll happen next why don t you keep to your own people
p00600_A,00600,A,i m coming back this way and don t argue excuse manners but i don t know anyone s position send my carriage back any time to morrow if you please
p00601_A,00601,A,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00602_A,00602,A,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00603_A,00603,A,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00604_A,00604,A,not much
p00605_A,00605,A,what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination
p00606_A,00606,A,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00607_A,00607,A,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00608_A,00608,A,you put it honestly anyhow
p00609_A,00609,A,it ll get us to heaven
p00610_A,00610,A,if heaven existed
p00611_A,00611,A,i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there
p00612_A,00612,A,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00613_A,00613,A,i don t go to that length
p00614_A,00614,A,she s an old lady
p00615_A,00615,A,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00616_A,00616,A,i fear not
p00617_A,00617,A,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else
p00618_A,00618,A,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00619_A,00619,A,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00620_A,00620,A,at once
p00621_A,00621,A,gladly in a minute
p00622_A,00622,A,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p00623_A,00623,A,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00624_A,00624,A,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p00625_A,00625,A,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00626_A,00626,A,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00627_A,00627,A,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00628_A,00628,A,i shall go round at once
p00629_A,00629,A,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00630_A,00630,A,i no longer want love
p00631_A,00631,A,but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air
p00632_A,00632,A,how could she have known what we don t
p00633_A,00633,A,write to me when you get to england
p00634_A,00634,A,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00635_A,00635,A,aziz was so fond of her too
p00636_A,00636,A,don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit
p00637_A,00637,A,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00638_A,00638,A,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00639_A,00639,A,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00640_A,00640,A,if one couldn t see the laughable side of these people one ld be done for
p00641_A,00641,A,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00642_A,00642,A,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p00643_A,00643,A,what can you expect from the fellow no grits no guts
p00644_A,00644,A,bust in front of the cow hospital did it and how did you come to be there
p00645_A,00645,A,oh lord oh lord when i live here and you live there not ten minutes from me and the cow hospital is right ever so far away the other side of you there then how did you come to be passing the cow hospital on the way to me now do some work for a change
p00646_A,00646,A,sir excuse me i did i mounted my bike and it bust in front of the cow hospital so i had to find a tonga
p00647_A,00647,A,i beg your pardon
p00648_A,00648,A,disaster may come but we shall at all events get there safe even if we do not get back it will i think create a good impression should two doctors arrive at the same time
p00649_A,00649,A,dr aziz dr aziz where you been i waited ten full minutes time at your house then i went
p00650_A,00650,A,post office do you not send your servants
p00651_A,00651,A,your servant spoke to me i saw your servant
p00652_A,00652,A,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00653_A,00653,A,it is fine to be young damn well oh very fine damn whom

p00682_A,00682,A,miss quested
p00683_A,00683,A,you can talk to miss quested about the peacock throne if you like she s artistic they say
p00684_A,00684,A,post impressionism indeed come along to tea this world is getting too much for me altogether
p00685_A,00685,A,besides the ladies i am expecting one of my assistants narayan godbole
p00686_A,00686,A,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00687_A,00687,A,why don t you fellows run a club in chandrapore aziz
p00688_A,00688,A,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p00689_A,00689,A,well are you
p00690_A,00690,A,you re sure i don t tire you by stopping
p00691_A,00691,A,anyhow you want to rest
p00692_A,00692,A,callendar doesn t trust anyone english or indian that s his character and i wish you weren t under him but you are and that s that
p00693_A,00693,A,who is this
p00694_A,00694,A,really i don t know why you pay me this great compliment aziz but i do appreciate it
p00695_A,00695,A,you would have allowed me to see her
p00696_A,00696,A,did she think they were your brothers
p00697_A,00697,A,and when the whole world behaves as such there will be no more purdah
p00698_A,00698,A,it s beginning at the wrong end isn t it i know but institutions and the governments don t
p00699_A,00699,A,how did you like the two ladies you met last thursday how do you like englishwomen generally
p00700_A,00700,A,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00701_A,00701,A,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00702_A,00702,A,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00703_A,00703,A,it must
p00704_A,00704,A,i don t care for children
p00705_A,00705,A,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00706_A,00706,A,good god why the girl s a prig
p00707_A,00707,A,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00708_A,00708,A,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00709_A,00709,A,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00710_A,00710,A,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00711_A,00711,A,i may have got it wrong i m out of club gossip but anyhow they re engaged to be married
p00712_A,00712,A,no you won t
p00713_A,00713,A,to whom
p00714_A,00714,A,thanks for telling me that yes i must try and be more careful if i m interested i m apt to forget myself still it doesn t do real harm
p00715_A,00715,A,it s often done so in the past
p00716_A,00716,A,if i do i do i shall survive it i travel light
p00717_A,00717,A,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00718_A,00718,A,very much
p00719_A,00719,A,i never can be in trouble
p00720_A,00720,A,godbole s pujah did it
p00721_A,00721,A,i m all right you re all right don t worry
p00722_A,00722,A,aziz can i have a drink
p00723_A,00723,A,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00724_A,00724,A,chandrapore the man s made a mistake
p00725_A,00725,A,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p00726_A,00726,A,aziz exactly where and how did you leave miss quested
p00727_A,00727,A,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00728_A,00728,A,is there a path off the top
p00729_A,00729,A,but you saw them get down safe
p00730_A,00730,A,then the guide came back to you
p00731_A,00731,A,i hope she wasn t ill
p00732_A,00732,A,yes that sounds sense
p00733_A,00733,A,aziz have you figured out what this picnic will cost you
p00734_A,00734,A,i told you he s no good
p00735_A,00735,A,aziz how monstrous
p00736_A,00736,A,my proverbs are a penny saved is a penny earned a stitch in time saves nine look before you leap and the british empire rests on them you will never kick us out you know until you cease employing m l s and such
p00737_A,00737,A,but you do you take them to a picnic
p00738_A,00738,A,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p00739_A,00739,A,you can t it s too late how are you to get round to the private entrance now come this way with me quick i ll put you into my carriage
p00740_A,00740,A,aziz are you awake
p00741_A,00741,A,i am useless at dreaming
p00742_A,00742,A,are you
p00743_A,00743,A,there ll be a general move at chandrapore
p00744_A,00744,A,they can t well move me down whatever their feelings
p00745_A,00745,A,you have won a great victory
p00746_A,00746,A,including knowing me
p00747_A,00747,A,yes certainly you must let off miss quested easily she must pay all your costs that is only fair but do not treat her like a conquered enemy
p00748_A,00748,A,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here
p00749_A,00749,A,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00750_A,00750,A,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one
p00751_A,00751,A,she ll apologize if that s the trouble look i ll make you an offer dictate to me whatever form of words you like and this time to morrow i ll bring it back signed this is not instead of any public apology she may make you in law it s an addition
p00752_A,00752,A,well good night good night it s time to go to sleep after that
p00753_A,00753,A,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00754_A,00754,A,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00755_A,00755,A,let us discuss that to morrow morning
p00756_A,00756,A,to whom
p00757_A,00757,A,i have not heard of other children
p00758_A,00758,A,i knew her so slightly
p00759_A,00759,A,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz
p00760_A,00760,A,i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit
p00761_A,00761,A,your unfairness is worse than my materialism
p00762_A,00762,A,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00763_A,00763,A,not very listen to mine at the conference it was settled
p00764_A,00764,A,they would say that
p00765_A,00765,A,don t bother miss quested has cleared out at last
p00766_A,00766,A,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00767_A,00767,A,as dismay and anxiety
p00768_A,00768,A,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00769_A,00769,A,as far as i do mind i travel light
p00770_A,00770,A,what enemies
p00771_A,00771,A,now what is the matter
p00772_A,00772,A,it simply doesn t affect me spies are as thick as mosquitoes but it s years before i shall meet the one that kills me you ve something else in your mind
p00773_A,00773,A,you have you re cross with me about something or other
p00774_A,00774,A,you little rotter well i m damned amusement indeed is it likely at such a time
p00775_A,00775,A,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00776_A,00776,A,you re not offended
p00777_A,00777,A,if you are this must be cleared up later on
p00778_A,00778,A,but the way i said it must be cleared up i was unintentionally rude unreserved regrets
p00779_A,00779,A,oh leave it alone like all gossip it s merely one of those half alive things that try to crowd out real life take no notice it ll vanish like poor old mrs moore s tombs
p00780_A,00780,A,we ll discuss m l at dinner
p00781_A,00781,A,bring das to me
p00782_A,00782,A,in other words probably never for i am going quite soon to england
p00783_A,00783,A,i am only going for a little time on official business my service is anxious to get me away from chandrapore for a bit it is obliged to value me highly but does not care for me the situation is somewhat humorous
p00784_A,00784,A,enough to see my friends
p00785_A,00785,A,willingly what subject
p00786_A,00786,A,let us talk about poetry you people are sadly circumstanced whatever are you to write about you cannot say for evermore we know it s faded yet you can t have patriotic poetry of the india my india type when it s nobody s india
p00787_A,00787,A,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00788_A,00788,A,i hoped you would be
p00789_A,00789,A,there is something in religion that may not be true but has not yet been sung
p00790_A,00790,A,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00791_A,00791,A,hindus are unable to sing
p00792_A,00792,A,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00793_A,00793,A,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00794_A,00794,A,an artistic and thoughtful little suburb of london
p00795_A,00795,A,when would you like the carriage
p00796_A,00796,A,but you haven t got your bicycle my carriage fetched you let it take you away
p00797_A,00797,A,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00798_A,00798,A,yes to my eternal confusion you know how fond i am of you
p00799_A,00799,A,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00800_A,00800,A,why have you not answered my letters is there a short cut down to our carriage we must give up our walk the weather s pestilential
p00801_A,00801,A,are you not coming down yourself how goes it aziz
p00802_A,00802,A,are you making anything out of your life here
p00803_A,00803,A,who is in charge of the guest house
p00804_A,00804,A,where is he then
p00805_A,00805,A,i wrote beforehand to the durbar and asked if a visit was convenient i was told it was and arranged my tour accordingly but the guest house servants appear to have no definite instructions we can t get any eggs also my wife wants to go out in the boat
p00806_A,00806,A,exactly and no oars
p00807_A,00807,A,all four
p00808_A,00808,A,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00809_A,00809,A,will there be any objection to english people watching the procession
p00810_A,00810,A,we had a very different reception both at mudkul and deora they were kindness itself at deora the maharajah and maharani wanted us to see everything
p00811_A,00811,A,jump in ralph
p00812_A,00812,A,who on earth is mr quested
p00813_A,00813,A,quested quested don t you know that my wife was mrs moore s daughter perhaps this explains your odd attitude
p00814_A,00814,A,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you
p00815_A,00815,A,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00816_A,00816,A,if you won t talk about the marabar to stella why won t you talk to ralph he is a wise boy really and same metaphor he rides a little behind her though with her
p00817_A,00817,A,no we won t think about it from her point of view mau has been a success it calmed her both of them suffer from restlessness she found something soothing some solution of her queer troubles here do you know anything about this krishna business
p00818_A,00818,A,gokul is the village where krishna was born well more or less born for there s the same hovering between it and another village as between bethlehem and nazareth what i want to discover is its spiritual side if it has one
p00819_A,00819,A,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00820_A,00820,A,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00821_A,00821,A,no further use for politeness
p00822_A,00822,A,away from us indians go to seed at once look at the king emperor high school look at you forgetting your medicine and going back to charms look at your poems

p00825_A,00825,A,oh your hindu friends will like that won t they
p00826_A,00826,A,it will indeed be arranged
p00827_A,00827,A,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00828_A,00828,A,of course of course you know me
p00829_A,00829,A,guess what i look like before you come out that will be a kind of game

p00832_A,00832,A,yes yes one minute
p00833_A,00833,A,no no one in my pocket here it is
p00834_A,00834,A,one minute again
p00835_A,00835,A,but i always thought that englishmen kept their rooms so tidy it seems that this is not so i need not be so ashamed everything ranged coldly on shelves was what i thought i say mr fielding is the stud going to go in
p00836_A,00836,A,what s that last sentence please will you teach me some new words and so improve my english let me put in your stud i see the shirt back s hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity
p00837_A,00837,A,we wear them to pass the police
p00838_A,00838,A,if i m biking in english dress starch collar hat with ditch they take no notice when i wear a fez they cry your lamp s out lord curzon did not consider this when he urged natives of india to retain their picturesque costumes hooray stud s gone in sometimes i shut my eyes and dream i have splendid clothes again and am riding into battle behind alamgir mr fielding must not india have been beautiful then with the mogul empire at its height and alamgir reigning at delhi upon the peacock throne
p00839_A,00839,A,meet me i know no ladies
p00840_A,00840,A,oh yes i remember an excessively aged lady but will you please repeat the name of her companion
p00841_A,00841,A,just as you wish
p00842_A,00842,A,is she a post impressionist
p00843_A,00843,A,i do not consider mrs moore my friend i only met her accidentally in my mosque a single meeting is too short to make a friend
p00844_A,00844,A,oho the deccani brahman
p00845_A,00845,A,i should think not do you know what deccani brahmans say that england conquered india from them from them mind and not from the moguls is not that like their cheek they have even bribed it to appear in text books for they are so subtle and immensely rich professor godbole must be quite unlike all other deccani brahmans from all i can hear say a most sincere chap
p00846_A,00846,A,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p00847_A,00847,A,mangoes mangoes
p00848_A,00848,A,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00849_A,00849,A,enquire from dr panna lal
p00850_A,00850,A,here s your home here s the celebrated hospitality of the east look at the flies look at the chunam coming off the walls isn t it jolly now i suppose you want to be off having seen an oriental interior
p00851_A,00851,A,i can rest the whole day thanks to worthy dr lal major callendar s spy i suppose you know but this time it didn t work i am allowed to have a slight temperature
p00852_A,00852,A,open it
p00853_A,00853,A,she was my wife you are the first englishman she has ever come before now put her photograph away
p00854_A,00854,A,oh it s nothing she was not a highly educated woman or even beautiful but put it away you would have seen her so why should you not see her photograph
p00855_A,00855,A,why not i believe in the purdah but i should have told her you were my brother and she would have seen you hamidullah saw her and several others
p00856_A,00856,A,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife
p00857_A,00857,A,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00858_A,00858,A,put her away she is of no importance she is dead i showed her to you because i have nothing else to show you may look round the whole of my bungalow now and empty everything i have no other secrets my three children live away with their grandmamma and that is all
p00859_A,00859,A,hamidullah liked them in england here we never look at them oh no much too careful let s talk of something else
p00860_A,00860,A,why are you not married
p00861_A,00861,A,excuse the following question have you any illegitimate children
p00862_A,00862,A,then your name will entirely die out
p00863_A,00863,A,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00864_A,00864,A,caring has nothing to do with it
p00865_A,00865,A,why don t you marry miss quested
p00866_A,00866,A,prig prig kindly explain isn t that a bad word
p00867_A,00867,A,but prig mr fielding how s that
p00868_A,00868,A,i thought her so nice and sincere
p00869_A,00869,A,has she indeed i am so glad
p00870_A,00870,A,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00871_A,00871,A,yes you re out of it my poor chap no miss quested for mr fielding however she was not beautiful she has practically no breasts if you come to think of it for the city magistrate they shall be sufficient perhaps and he for her for you i shall arrange a lady with breasts like mangoes
p00872_A,00872,A,i will not really and besides your position makes it dangerous for you you can t be too careful in every way mr fielding whatever you say or do in this damned country there is always some envious fellow on the look out you may be surprised to know that there were at least three spies sitting here when you came to enquire i was really a good deal upset that you talked in that fashion about god they will certainly report it
p00873_A,00873,A,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00874_A,00874,A,but speaking out may get you into trouble
p00875_A,00875,A,there listen to that but the end of it might be that you lost your job
p00876_A,00876,A,travel light you are a most extraordinary race is it your climate or what
p00877_A,00877,A,i know i gave him orders not to such are the tricks we play on unfortunate englishmen poor mr fielding but i will release you now oh dear with the exception of yourself and hamidullah i have no one to talk to in this place you like hamidullah don t you
p00878_A,00878,A,do you promise to come at once to us when you are in trouble
p00879_A,00879,A,jump on i must have you
p00880_A,00880,A,oh she s all right she went down to see miss derek well here s luck chin chin
p00881_A,00881,A,here s luck and here s to england oh yes that s quite likely i knew they d gone for a spin
p00882_A,00882,A,oh no why
p00883_A,00883,A,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00884_A,00884,A,up there

p00890_A,00890,A,i see you re worrying let s talk of other things miss quested was always to do what she wished it was our arrangement i see you are worrying on my account but really i don t mind i never notice trifles
p00891_A,00891,A,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00892_A,00892,A,he is plenty of good for himself his dishonesty will ruin me
p00893_A,00893,A,i am delighted with him really he has made my guests comfortable besides it is my duty to employ him he is my cousin if money goes money comes if money stays death comes did you ever hear that useful urdu proverb probably not for i have just invented it
p00894_A,00894,A,oh kick you out why should i trouble over that dirty job leave it to the politicians no when i was a student i got excited over your damned countrymen certainly but if they ll let me get on with my profession and not be too rude to me officially i really don t ask for more
p00895_A,00895,A,my children and my name
p00896_A,00896,A,cyril cyril don t leave me

p00898_A,00898,A,good night then dear fellow are you content with our day s work cyril
p00899_A,00899,A,except that i ate too much i say panna lal and callendar ll get the sack
p00900_A,00900,A,and you ll get promotion
p00901_A,00901,A,in any case we spend our holidays together and visit kashmir possibly persia for i shall have plenty of money paid to me on account of the injury sustained by my character while with me you shall never spend a single pie this is what i have always wished and as the result of my misfortunes it has come
p00902_A,00902,A,i know my dear chap i know your voice need not become so solemn and anxious i know what you are going to say next let oh let miss quested off paying so that the english may say the approval of your compatriots no longer interests me i have become anti british and ought to have done so sooner it would have saved me numerous misfortunes
p00903_A,00903,A,i say shall we go and pour water on to mohammed latif s face he is so funny when this is done to him asleep
p00904_A,00904,A,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00905_A,00905,A,i am looking though it gets a bit dark i see cyril fielding to be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend but in some ways a fool you think that by letting miss quested off easily i shall make a better reputation for myself and indians generally no no it will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion officially i have decided to have nothing more to do with british india as a matter of fact i shall seek service in some moslem state such as hyderabad bhopal where englishmen cannot insult me any more don t counsel me otherwise
p00906_A,00906,A,i don t want to hear your long talks
p00907_A,00907,A,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology
p00908_A,00908,A,will she sign that
p00909_A,00909,A,good night i suppose it is
p00910_A,00910,A,i put up with all things in you so what is to be done
p00911_A,00911,A,cyril i have had an idea which will satisfy your tender mind i shall consult mrs moore her opinion will solve everything i can trust her so absolutely if she advises me to pardon this girl i shall do so she will counsel me nothing against my real and true honour as you might
p00912_A,00912,A,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00913_A,00913,A,to those other children
p00914_A,00914,A,just as i have two boys and a girl so has mrs moore she told me in the mosque
p00915_A,00915,A,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00916_A,00916,A,is emotion a sack of potatoes so much the pound to be measured out am i a machine i shall be told i can use up my emotions by using them next
p00917_A,00917,A,if you are right there is no point in any friendship it all comes down to give and take or give and return which is disgusting and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic
p00918_A,00918,A,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00919_A,00919,A,i do not believe him
p00920_A,00920,A,give in to the east you can trust me cyril can t you see that i m grateful to you for your help and want to reward you
p00921_A,00921,A,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00922_A,00922,A,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00923_A,00923,A,it s all over the town and may injure your reputation you know everyone is by no means your supporter i have tried all i could to silence such a story
p00924_A,00924,A,it is those who stop in the country not those who leave it whom such a story injures imagine my dismay and anxiety i could scarcely get a wink of sleep first my name was coupled with her and now it is yours
p00925_A,00925,A,as what
p00926_A,00926,A,have i not lived all my life in india do i not know what produces a bad impression here
p00927_A,00927,A,you mind for miss quested s sake though i can see from your face
p00928_A,00928,A,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00929_A,00929,A,i have given you list after list of the people who cannot be trusted in this city in your position i should have the sense to know i was surrounded by enemies you observe i speak in a low voice it is because i see your sais is new how do i know he isn t a spy every third servant is a spy
p00930_A,00930,A,do you contradict my last remark
p00931_A,00931,A,i ve not don t be ridiculous
p00932_A,00932,A,so you and madamsell adela used to amuse one another in the evening naughty boy
p00933_A,00933,A,oh i beg your pardon i m sure the licentious oriental imagination was at work
p00934_A,00934,A,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00935_A,00935,A,most certainly i am not
p00936_A,00936,A,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00937_A,00937,A,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this
p00938_A,00938,A,mohammed latif has taken to intriguing we are already much displeased with him will it satisfy you if we send him back to his family without a present
p00939_A,00939,A,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das
p00940_A,00940,A,he will have invited other friends

p00942_A,00942,A,what is the nature of the business will it leave you much spare time
p00943_A,00943,A,i expected you to make such a reply you are a faithful friend shall we now talk about something else
p00944_A,00944,A,poetry let us discuss why poetry has lost the power of making men brave my mother s father was also a poet and fought against you in the mutiny i might equal him if there was another mutiny as it is i am a doctor who has won a case and has three children to support and whose chief subject of conversation is official plans
p00945_A,00945,A,i like this conversation it may lead to something interesting
p00946_A,00946,A,i was a child when you knew me first everyone was my friend then the friend a persian expression for god but i do not want to be a religious poet either
p00947_A,00947,A,why when you yourself are an atheist

p00974_A,00974,A,as i fell into our largest mau tank under circumstances our other friends will relate i thought how brave miss quested was and decided to tell her so despite my imperfect english through you i am happy here with my children instead of in a prison of that i make no doubt my children shall be taught to speak of you with the greatest affection and respect
p00975_A,00975,A,i want to do kind actions all round and wipe out the wretched business of the marabar for ever i have been so disgracefully hasty thinking you meant to get hold of my money as bad a mistake as the cave itself
p00976_A,00976,A,how so

p00979_A,00979,A,my dear chap officially they call it gokul ashtami all the state offices are closed but how else should it concern you and me
p00980_A,00980,A,it is useless discussing hindus with me living with them teaches me no more when i think i annoy them i do not when i think i don t annoy them i do perhaps they will sack me for tumbling on to their dolls house on the other hand perhaps they will double my salary time will prove why so curious about them

p01014_A,01014,A,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean
p01015_A,01015,A,oh my happiness that s quite another problem i want to consult you about this anglo indian difficulty can you give me any advice
p01016_A,01016,A,i am told we all get rude after a year
p01017_A,01017,A,no i m all right thanks are you married dr aziz
p01018_A,01018,A,thank you

p01021_A,01021,A,have you one wife or more than one
p01022_A,01022,A,oh please do not mention a little thing like that is there anything else i may tell you about my country
p01023_A,01023,A,then back with water streaming over you and perhaps rather a pain inside but i did not mind all my friends were paining with me we have a proverb in urdu what does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy together which comes in conveniently after mangoes miss quested do wait for mangoes why not settle altogether in india
p01024_A,01024,A,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01025_A,01025,A,yes all that is settled i invite you all to see me in the marabar caves
p01026_A,01026,A,i know
p01027_A,01027,A,good bye mrs moore
p01028_A,01028,A,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p01029_A,01029,A,what a shame you leave india so soon oh do reconsider your decision do stay
p01030_A,01030,A,send back your servant he is unnecessary then we shall all be moslems together
p01031_A,01031,A,i am to blame i am the host
p01032_A,01032,A,mohammed latif by the way what is in these caves brother why are we all going to see them
p01033_A,01033,A,good morning good morning put on your topis put on your topis at once the early sun is highly dangerous for heads i speak as a doctor
p01034_A,01034,A,not for my thick head
p01035_A,01035,A,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01036_A,01036,A,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01037_A,01037,A,this breakfast did you think i should treat you so strangely
p01038_A,01038,A,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p01039_A,01039,A,ralph and stella yes i know everything about them but we must not forget to visit our caves one of the dreams of my life is accomplished in having you both here as my guests you cannot imagine how you have honoured me i feel like the emperor babur
p01040_A,01040,A,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01041_A,01041,A,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start
p01042_A,01042,A,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01043_A,01043,A,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p01044_A,01044,A,miss quested fine but foolish you keep your religion i mine that is the best nothing embraces the whole of india nothing nothing and that was akbar s mistake
p01045_A,01045,A,on which my heartiest congratulations
p01046_A,01046,A,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p01047_A,01047,A,you are certain to be happy with any relative of mrs moore s
p01048_A,01048,A,you are absolutely unlike the others i assure you you will never be rude to my people
p01049_A,01049,A,then you are told a lie come along
p01050_A,01050,A,pretty sure they should come on some interesting old carvings soon

p01052_A,01052,A,yes indeed do come and see my wife
p01053_A,01053,A,she is not in chandrapore just now
p01054_A,01054,A,yes indeed three
p01055_A,01055,A,why naturally i adore them i suppose so
p01056_A,01056,A,an indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us this morning at nine it has never come we waited and waited and waited we can t think what happened
p01057_A,01057,A,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p01058_A,01058,A,oh do you think so mr fielding
p01059_A,01059,A,good bye mr fielding and thank you so much what lovely college buildings

p01062_A,01062,A,mr fielding have you seen miss quested
p01063_A,01063,A,miss derek is most unsatisfactory and restless always in a hurry always wanting something new she will do anything in the world except go back to the indian lady who pays her
p01064_A,01064,A,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01065_A,01065,A,i know
p01066_A,01066,A,a mystery is a muddle
p01067_A,01067,A,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01068_A,01068,A,good bye miss quested

p01077_A,01077,A,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01078_A,01078,A,still they are ornamented in some way
p01079_A,01079,A,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01080_A,01080,A,describe them to this lady then

p01082_A,01082,A,did he since when

p01085_A,01085,A,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p01086_A,01086,A,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01087_A,01087,A,oh no oh no
p01088_A,01088,A,oh no
p01089_A,01089,A,no i should not quite say that
p01090_A,01090,A,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01091_A,01091,A,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly

p01094_A,01094,A,then tell me everything you will or i shall never understand india are they the hills i sometimes see in the evening what are these caves
p01095_A,01095,A,are they large caves
p01096_A,01096,A,do describe them professor godbole
p01097_A,01097,A,something like the caves at elephanta
p01098_A,01098,A,good bye professor godbole it s a shame we never heard you sing
p01099_A,01099,A,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01100_A,01100,A,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01101_A,01101,A,no not large
p01102_A,01102,A,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01103_A,01103,A,not heard of them the marabar caves in the marabar hills
p01104_A,01104,A,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p01105_A,01105,A,come along up and join us mr heaslop sit down till your mother turns up he may not understand that allow me
p01106_A,01106,A,i m sorry what s up
p01107_A,01107,A,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p01108_A,01108,A,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01109_A,01109,A,i may sing now
p01110_A,01110,A,may i now take my leave now i take my leave i must tell you how glad i am to hear that after all you succeeded in reaching the marabar i feared my unpunctuality had prevented you but you went a far pleasanter method in miss derek s car i hope the expedition was a successful one
p01111_A,01111,A,oh yes
p01112_A,01112,A,oh yes that is all round the college
p01113_A,01113,A,i cannot say i was not present
p01114_A,01114,A,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01115_A,01115,A,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01116_A,01116,A,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01117_A,01117,A,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01118_A,01118,A,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01119_A,01119,A,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01120_A,01120,A,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01121_A,01121,A,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01122_A,01122,A,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01123_A,01123,A,thanks so much what was that
p01124_A,01124,A,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01125_A,01125,A,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01126_A,01126,A,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01127_A,01127,A,i am most frightfully cut up
p01128_A,01128,A,yes alas
p01129_A,01129,A,a name a name for a school
p01130_A,01130,A,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01131_A,01131,A,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01132_A,01132,A,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01133_A,01133,A,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01134_A,01134,A,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01135_A,01135,A,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01136_A,01136,A,yes yes
p01137_A,01137,A,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01138_A,01138,A,but he comes in some other song i hope
p01139_A,01139,A,oh no he refuses to come i say to him come come come come come come he neglects to come
p01140_A,01140,A,what do i hear what most improbable statement have i heard an english lady useless no no no no no
p01141_A,01141,A,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p01142_A,01142,A,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p01143_A,01143,A,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p01144_A,01144,A,all over oh yes the danger is past let us smoke cigarettes let us do anything we please oh yes enjoy ourselves oh my merciful god
p01145_A,01145,A,exactly too big for a goat
p01146_A,01146,A,sahib says hyena
p01147_A,01147,A,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01148_A,01148,A,ah now i begin to understand
p01149_A,01149,A,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p01150_A,01150,A,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p01151_A,01151,A,he may show you some aspect of the country i can t and he s a real loyalist i thought you might care for a bit of a change
p01152_A,01152,A,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p01153_A,01153,A,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p01154_A,01154,A,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p01155_A,01155,A,my fault that i told him to come this way because the road s better mr lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills

p01224_A,01224,A,aziz aziz my dear boy we must be going we are already late get well quickly for i do not know what our little circle would do without you
p01225_A,01225,A,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01226_A,01226,A,add mine to them
p01227_A,01227,A,gentlemen you will excuse i have come to enquire by major callendar s orders
p01228_A,01228,A,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01229_A,01229,A,it is only my duty
p01230_A,01230,A,yes that is true
p01231_A,01231,A,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01232_A,01232,A,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p01233_A,01233,A,here he lies
p01234_A,01234,A,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01235_A,01235,A,we know how busy you are
p01236_A,01236,A,and how much illness there is in the city
p01237_A,01237,A,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01238_A,01238,A,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01239_A,01239,A,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01240_A,01240,A,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01241_A,01241,A,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01242_A,01242,A,it is only a boy
p01243_A,01243,A,i think not much
p01244_A,01244,A,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01245_A,01245,A,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01246_A,01246,A,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01247_A,01247,A,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01248_A,01248,A,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01249_A,01249,A,even boys must learn
p01250_A,01250,A,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01251_A,01251,A,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01252_A,01252,A,forgive my mistakes
p01253_A,01253,A,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01254_A,01254,A,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p01255_A,01255,A,oh that is true how true
p01256_A,01256,A,does mr fielding think it s true
p01257_A,01257,A,no no the existence of providence
p01258_A,01258,A,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01259_A,01259,A,and does not morality also decline
p01260_A,01260,A,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01261_A,01261,A,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01262_A,01262,A,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01263_A,01263,A,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01264_A,01264,A,ah ah has some evidence come
p01265_A,01265,A,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01266_A,01266,A,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01267_A,01267,A,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01268_A,01268,A,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01269_A,01269,A,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01270_A,01270,A,hullo my dear fielding so i run you down at last can you come out at once to dilkusha
p01271_A,01271,A,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01272_A,01272,A,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01273_A,01273,A,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01274_A,01274,A,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01275_A,01275,A,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01276_A,01276,A,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01277_A,01277,A,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01278_A,01278,A,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01279_A,01279,A,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01280_A,01280,A,may is no month to allow an old lady to travel in
p01281_A,01281,A,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01282_A,01282,A,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01283_A,01283,A,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01284_A,01284,A,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01285_A,01285,A,i don t believe in god
p01286_A,01286,A,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01287_A,01287,A,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01288_A,01288,A,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01289_A,01289,A,i guess they do i got in first
p01290_A,01290,A,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01291_A,01291,A,none chuck em out
p01292_A,01292,A,it s all a mistake
p01293_A,01293,A,it will come
p01294_A,01294,A,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01295_A,01295,A,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01296_A,01296,A,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01297_A,01297,A,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01298_A,01298,A,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p01299_A,01299,A,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01300_A,01300,A,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01301_A,01301,A,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01302_A,01302,A,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01303_A,01303,A,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01304_A,01304,A,i ll see him first if you prefer
p01305_A,01305,A,thank goodness that s over
p01306_A,01306,A,he couldn t very well after my behaviour to him at the club heaslop doesn t come out badly besides fate has treated him pretty roughly to day he has had a cable to the effect that his mother s dead poor old soul
p01307_A,01307,A,she died at sea
p01308_A,01308,A,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01309_A,01309,A,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01310_A,01310,A,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01311_A,01311,A,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p01312_A,01312,A,well i don t believe in providence
p01313_A,01313,A,but how then can you believe in god
p01314_A,01314,A,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01315_A,01315,A,oh that is true how true
p01316_A,01316,A,i beg pardon but some might say your leg kicks
p01317_A,01317,A,aziz has a high opinion of you he only did not speak because of his illness
p01318_A,01318,A,bad bad you have destroyed me
p01319_A,01319,A,hurry up sir we pull you in a procession
p01320_A,01320,A,and he is such a horrible servant antony you can go we don t want you
p01321_A,01321,A,mistress tells you to go
p01322_A,01322,A,master told me to come
p01323_A,01323,A,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01324_A,01324,A,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english
p01325_A,01325,A,tell me another time brother when i have more leisure for now as i have already explained we have to give pleasure to non moslems three will be europeans one a hindu which must not be forgotten every attention must be paid to professor godbole lest he feel that he is inferior to my other guests
p01326_A,01326,A,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01327_A,01327,A,you spick lie
p01328_A,01328,A,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01329_A,01329,A,merciful god
p01330_A,01330,A,oh what a surprise
p01331_A,01331,A,why haven t you gone to the marabar
p01332_A,01332,A,dr aziz it is my highly painful duty to arrest you
p01333_A,01333,A,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01334_A,01334,A,i am under instructions not to say
p01335_A,01335,A,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde
p01336_A,01336,A,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01337_A,01337,A,hullo some mistake
p01338_A,01338,A,on what charge do you arrest him
p01339_A,01339,A,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01340_A,01340,A,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01341_A,01341,A,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p01342_A,01342,A,the worst thing in my whole career has happened miss quested has been insulted in one of the marabar caves
p01343_A,01343,A,she escaped by god s grace
p01344_A,01344,A,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01345_A,01345,A,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01346_A,01346,A,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01347_A,01347,A,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01348_A,01348,A,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01349_A,01349,A,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01350_A,01350,A,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01351_A,01351,A,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01352_A,01352,A,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01353_A,01353,A,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01354_A,01354,A,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01355_A,01355,A,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01356_A,01356,A,oh no oh no no
p01357_A,01357,A,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01358_A,01358,A,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01359_A,01359,A,then she s mad
p01360_A,01360,A,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01361_A,01361,A,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01362_A,01362,A,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01363_A,01363,A,i shall certainly come sir and i am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over me may i venture to ask where miss quested is
p01364_A,01364,A,i believe dr aziz to be innocent
p01365_A,01365,A,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01366_A,01366,A,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01367_A,01367,A,i have accepted re election sir do you regard it as necessary i should come i should be glad to be excused indeed i have a dinner engagement this evening
p01368_A,01368,A,what is the charge precisely
p01369_A,01369,A,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01370_A,01370,A,did she say any more
p01371_A,01371,A,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01372_A,01372,A,was a guide not with her
p01373_A,01373,A,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01374_A,01374,A,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01375_A,01375,A,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01376_A,01376,A,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01377_A,01377,A,i don t follow
p01378_A,01378,A,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01379_A,01379,A,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01380_A,01380,A,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01381_A,01381,A,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01382_A,01382,A,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01383_A,01383,A,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01384_A,01384,A,i know but she tells it to you
p01385_A,01385,A,i wish you wouldn t
p01386_A,01386,A,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01387_A,01387,A,well when he s done with them
p01388_A,01388,A,i say he s innocent
p01389_A,01389,A,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01390_A,01390,A,so i have just told you
p01391_A,01391,A,i see what you mean
p01392_A,01392,A,can i visit aziz
p01393_A,01393,A,to whom do i apply for an order
p01394_A,01394,A,that sounds comfortable
p01395_A,01395,A,that s his wife
p01396_A,01396,A,he told me
p01397_A,01397,A,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01398_A,01398,A,have a look at them
p01399_A,01399,A,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01400_A,01400,A,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01401_A,01401,A,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01402_A,01402,A,i hardly think that would do surely
p01403_A,01403,A,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01404_A,01404,A,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01405_A,01405,A,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01406_A,01406,A,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01407_A,01407,A,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01408_A,01408,A,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01409_A,01409,A,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01410_A,01410,A,possibly my wife might ask her that much

p01419_A,01419,A,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01420_A,01420,A,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01421_A,01421,A,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01422_A,01422,A,city magistrate

p01435_A,01435,A,mrs blakiston was saying if only there were a few tommies
p01436_A,01436,A,right you are burra sahib angels exactly

p01439_A,01439,A,stand up you swine
p01440_A,01440,A,no one s out of danger in this country as long as they have a temperature
p01441_A,01441,A,take me some time to do that
p01442_A,01442,A,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01443_A,01443,A,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01444_A,01444,A,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01445_A,01445,A,squat down callendar tell us all about it

p01448_A,01448,A,why should it
p01449_A,01449,A,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01450_A,01450,A,i wish to god i hadn t given my jewel of an assistant leave i ld cut my tongue out first to feel i m responsible that s what hits me to refuse and then give in under pressure that is what i did my sons that is what i did i understood an englishman was to accompany the expedition that is why i gave in
p01451_A,01451,A,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01452_A,01452,A,we shall do we shall do
p01453_A,01453,A,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01454_A,01454,A,no what about him
p01455_A,01455,A,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01456_A,01456,A,do come quietly mary
p01457_A,01457,A,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01458_A,01458,A,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01459_A,01459,A,then what do you mean
p01460_A,01460,A,that s ridiculous
p01461_A,01461,A,does anyone here present want to
p01462_A,01462,A,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01463_A,01463,A,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01464_A,01464,A,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01465_A,01465,A,how is your mother old boy
p01466_A,01466,A,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01467_A,01467,A,i do i do i m satisfied
p01468_A,01468,A,not one of them s all right
p01469_A,01469,A,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01470_A,01470,A,my old das is all right
p01471_A,01471,A,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01472_A,01472,A,hear hear
p01473_A,01473,A,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p01474_A,01474,A,he s a crank a crank
p01475_A,01475,A,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01476_A,01476,A,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01477_A,01477,A,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01478_A,01478,A,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01479_A,01479,A,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01480_A,01480,A,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01481_A,01481,A,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01482_A,01482,A,you went alone into one of those caves
p01483_A,01483,A,the prisoner followed you didn t he
p01484_A,01484,A,i beg your pardon
p01485_A,01485,A,what is that what are you saying speak up please
p01486_A,01486,A,what nature of mistake
p01487_A,01487,A,i must come before someone
p01488_A,01488,A,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01489_A,01489,A,why should he write to me
p01490_A,01490,A,is it
p01491_A,01491,A,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01492_A,01492,A,i know where you mean
p01493_A,01493,A,that is quite correct
p01494_A,01494,A,i am not i am not quite sure
p01495_A,01495,A,i cannot be sure
p01496_A,01496,A,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01497_A,01497,A,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01498_A,01498,A,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01499_A,01499,A,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01500_A,01500,A,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p01501_A,01501,A,all right i said don t apologize
p01502_A,01502,A,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01503_A,01503,A,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01504_A,01504,A,at last some sense is being talked
p01505_A,01505,A,that s better
p01506_A,01506,A,even when the lady is so uglier than the gentleman
p01507_A,01507,A,turn that man out
p01508_A,01508,A,i must have better arrangements than this made for my patient why isn t she given a seat on the platform she gets no air
p01509_A,01509,A,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01510_A,01510,A,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01511_A,01511,A,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01512_A,01512,A,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01513_A,01513,A,are you all right yourselves
p01514_A,01514,A,and the prisoner followed you
p01515_A,01515,A,excuse me we object to the presence of so many european ladies and gentlemen upon the platform they will have the effect of intimidating our witnesses their place is with the rest of the public in the body of the hall we have no objection to miss quested remaining on the platform since she has been unwell we shall extend every courtesy to her throughout despite the scientific truths revealed to us by the district superintendent of police but we do object to the others
p01516_A,01516,A,i agree to that it was only to miss quested that i gave permission to sit up here her friends should be so excessively kind as to climb down
p01517_A,01517,A,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01518_A,01518,A,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01519_A,01519,A,i should object a platform confers authority
p01520_A,01520,A,thank you very much sir thank you mr heaslop thank you ladies all
p01521_A,01521,A,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01522_A,01522,A,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01523_A,01523,A,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01524_A,01524,A,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01525_A,01525,A,not buddhist i think jain
p01526_A,01526,A,all the marabar caves are jain
p01527_A,01527,A,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01528_A,01528,A,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01529_A,01529,A,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01530_A,01530,A,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01531_A,01531,A,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01532_A,01532,A,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01533_A,01533,A,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01534_A,01534,A,this is no way to defend your case
p01535_A,01535,A,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01536_A,01536,A,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01537_A,01537,A,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01538_A,01538,A,i apologize for my colleague he is an intimate friend of our client and his feelings have carried him away
p01539_A,01539,A,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01540_A,01540,A,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01541_A,01541,A,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01542_A,01542,A,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01543_A,01543,A,are you mad
p01544_A,01544,A,right i withdraw
p01545_A,01545,A,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01546_A,01546,A,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01547_A,01547,A,dr aziz never
p01548_A,01548,A,i withdraw everything
p01549_A,01549,A,give me time to consider
p01550_A,01550,A,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01551_A,01551,A,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01552_A,01552,A,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01553_A,01553,A,sir i intend these for you sir
p01554_A,01554,A,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01555_A,01555,A,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01556_A,01556,A,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p01557_A,01557,A,oh my god
p01558_A,01558,A,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01559_A,01559,A,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01560_A,01560,A,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01561_A,01561,A,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01562_A,01562,A,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01563_A,01563,A,ah you were boasting she had reached aden in court
p01564_A,01564,A,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01565_A,01565,A,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p01566_A,01566,A,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01567_A,01567,A,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p01568_A,01568,A,at last
p01569_A,01569,A,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01570_A,01570,A,does he tell me to come out to him
p01571_A,01571,A,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01572_A,01572,A,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p01573_A,01573,A,twenty thousand rupees
p01574_A,01574,A,to what duties miss quested are you returning in your own country after your taste of the tropics observe i don t say to what do you turn but to what do you re turn every life ought to contain both a turn and a re turn this celebrated pioneer will make my question clear he turns to the east he re turns to the west you can see it from the cute position of his hands one of which holds a string of sausages
p01575_A,01575,A,my dear das why when you tried to send me to prison should i try to send mr bhattacharya a poem eh that is naturally entirely a joke i will write him the best i can but i thought your magazine was for hindus
p01576_A,01576,A,there is no such person in existence as the general indian
p01577_A,01577,A,i know but will it last
p01578_A,01578,A,half a sec here you are is not this better than a poem
p01579_A,01579,A,you are full of compliments to day
p01580_A,01580,A,oh well about this poem how did you hear i sometimes scribbled
p01581_A,01581,A,how did he hear
p01582_A,01582,A,it is not for hindus but indians generally
p01583_A,01583,A,there was not but there may be when you have written a poem you are our hero the whole city is behind you irrespective of creed
p01584_A,01584,A,i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul
p01585_A,01585,A,happy the man who can compose both
p01586_A,01586,A,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p01587_A,01587,A,excuse my mistakes realize my limitations life is not easy as we know it on the earth
p01588_A,01588,A,professor godbole often mentioned it before his departure for mau
p01589_A,01589,A,he too was a poet do you not divine each other
p01590_A,01590,A,i name this child shri krishna
p01591_A,01591,A,throw stones

p01618_A,01618,A,excellent news
p01619_A,01619,A,i have brought you some salve but how to put it on in your present nervous state becomes a problem

p01621_A,01621,A,they have not gone in the direction of mau i hope on a night like this the people become most fanatical
p01622_A,01622,A,like what
p01623_A,01623,A,how can you tell you strange fellow

p01625_A,01625,A,but you are heaslop s brother also and alas the two nations cannot be friends
p01626_A,01626,A,did your mother speak to you about me
p01627_A,01627,A,yes your mother was my best friend in all the world this is our monsoon the best weather how i wish she could have seen them our rains now is the time when all things are happy young and old they are happy out there with their savage noise though we cannot follow them the tanks are all full so they dance and this is india i wish you were not with officials then i would show you my country but i cannot perhaps i will just take you out on the water now for one short half hour
p01628_A,01628,A,what what do you mean

p01630_A,01630,A,i can t tell you what that is i m sure his highness is dead i think we should go back at once shall we go back now
p01631_A,01631,A,i d rather not go nearer they have such strange customs and might hurt you
p00000_B,00000,B,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00001_B,00001,B,but you understand my meaning
p00002_B,00002,B,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00003_B,00003,B,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00004_B,00004,B,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00005_B,00005,B,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00006_B,00006,B,some case i daresay
p00007_B,00007,B,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p00008_B,00008,B,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00009_B,00009,B,no no i do not admit that i have met others
p00010_B,00010,B,no let us surprise them without warning far too much nonsense still goes on among our ladies they pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah indeed those of them who can write composed a document to that effect and now it ends in humbug you know how deeply they all respect fielding but not one of them has seen him my wife says she will but always when he calls there is some excuse she is not feeling well she is ashamed of the room she has no nice sweets to offer him only elephants ears and if i say elephants ears are mr fielding s favourite sweet she replies that he will know how badly hers are made so she cannot see him on their account for fifteen years my dear boy have i argued with my begum for fifteen years and never gained a point yet the missionaries inform us our women are down trodden if you want a subject for a poem take this the indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be
p00011_B,00011,B,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00012_B,00012,B,oh that is going much too far
p00013_B,00013,B,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00014_B,00014,B,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00015_B,00015,B,to such a remark there is certainly no reply have you heard this naughty rumour that mohammed latif has got hold of
p00016_B,00016,B,do not apologize you are always late
p00017_B,00017,B,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00018_B,00018,B,and mine
p00019_B,00019,B,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00020_B,00020,B,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00021_B,00021,B,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00022_B,00022,B,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00023_B,00023,B,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00024_B,00024,B,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00025_B,00025,B,aunt they live most comfortably with my wife s mother where she was living when she died i can see them whenever i like they are such very very small children
p00026_B,00026,B,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00027_B,00027,B,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00028_B,00028,B,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00029_B,00029,B,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00030_B,00030,B,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please
p00031_B,00031,B,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00032_B,00032,B,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00033_B,00033,B,once is enough
p00034_B,00034,B,why talk about the english brrrr why be either friends with the fellows or not friends let us shut them out and be jolly queen victoria and mrs bannister were the only exceptions and they re dead
p00035_B,00035,B,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00036_B,00036,B,but not in an indian state
p00037_B,00037,B,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00038_B,00038,B,but the sahib has left me some message
p00039_B,00039,B,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00040_B,00040,B,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00041_B,00041,B,does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier world of yours
p00042_B,00042,B,i do not believe him
p00043_B,00043,B,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00044_B,00044,B,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00045_B,00045,B,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00046_B,00046,B,oh not yet hookah is so jolly now
p00047_B,00047,B,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00048_B,00048,B,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00049_B,00049,B,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00050_B,00050,B,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00051_B,00051,B,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00052_B,00052,B,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00053_B,00053,B,oh my god
p00054_B,00054,B,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00055_B,00055,B,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00056_B,00056,B,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00057_B,00057,B,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00058_B,00058,B,come and see my wife a little then
p00059_B,00059,B,and does it
p00060_B,00060,B,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00061_B,00061,B,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00062_B,00062,B,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00063_B,00063,B,well look at my own experience this morning
p00064_B,00064,B,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00065_B,00065,B,i do not for my own part i find such profound differences among our rulers red nose mumbles turton talks distinctly mrs turton takes bribes mrs red nose does not and cannot because so far there is no mrs red nose
p00066_B,00066,B,down with the civil surgeon rescue nureddin
p00067_B,00067,B,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00068_B,00068,B,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00069_B,00069,B,queen victoria was different
p00070_B,00070,B,so have i all ladies are far from alike
p00071_B,00071,B,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00072_B,00072,B,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00073_B,00073,B,perhaps but later
p00074_B,00074,B,ours take the gifts the gods provide anyhow
p00075_B,00075,B,sit down

p00108_B,00108,B,an indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us this morning at nine it has never come we waited and waited and waited we can t think what happened
p00109_B,00109,B,but you walk about yourself
p00110_B,00110,B,what are their names not also ronny ralph and stella surely
p00111_B,00111,B,no there are the younger ones ralph and stella in england
p00112_B,00112,B,rupees don t last for ever i m afraid
p00113_B,00113,B,i left them at the entrance
p00114_B,00114,B,mrs mrs moore i am afraid i startled you i shall tell my community our friends about you that god is here very good very fine indeed i think you are newly arrived in india
p00115_B,00115,B,how is that oh explain to me
p00116_B,00116,B,may i know your name
p00117_B,00117,B,it will soon be so unhealthy for you and why ever do you come to chandrapore
p00118_B,00118,B,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00119_B,00119,B,what was the name of the play
p00120_B,00120,B,good bye mrs moore
p00121_B,00121,B,i m a doctor snakes don t dare bite me please may i ask you a question now why do you come to india at this time of year just as the cold weather is ending
p00122_B,00122,B,oh no excuse me that is quite impossible our city magistrate s name is mr heaslop i know him intimately
p00123_B,00123,B,oh she s all right she went down to see miss derek well here s luck chin chin
p00124_B,00124,B,of course but so few ladies take the trouble especially if thinking no one is there to see
p00125_B,00125,B,by the way you address me no but can i call you a carriage
p00126_B,00126,B,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00127_B,00127,B,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00128_B,00128,B,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance
p00129_B,00129,B,and how rough and rude i was and how good you were
p00130_B,00130,B,oh can i do you some service now or at any time
p00131_B,00131,B,would you care to see over the minto hospital one morning i have nothing else to offer at chandrapore
p00132_B,00132,B,what what you didn t like her
p00133_B,00133,B,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00134_B,00134,B,but mrs moore how can he be
p00135_B,00135,B,dear mrs moore what does anything matter so long as you are my guests i am very glad you are not coming which sounds strange but you are treating me with true frankness as a friend yes i am your friend so may i make another suggestion don t let so many people come with you this time i think you may find it more convenient exactly exactly is that all right
p00136_B,00136,B,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00137_B,00137,B,yes now i see and your first husband died
p00138_B,00138,B,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p00139_B,00139,B,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00140_B,00140,B,you have
p00141_B,00141,B,ah a very charming lady
p00142_B,00142,B,then you are an oriental indians are not allowed into the chandrapore club even as guests
p00143_B,00143,B,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00144_B,00144,B,oh i am used to it
p00145_B,00145,B,no indeed how funny it sounds their names are quite different and will surprise you listen please i am about to tell you my children s names the first is called ahmed the second is called karim the third she is the eldest jamila three children are enough do not you agree with me
p00146_B,00146,B,and the gentleman here is he ralph and stella s half brother
p00147_B,00147,B,mine would god would give me more when he saw i gave always be giving like the nawab bahadur my father was the same that is why he died poor so we would sit giving for ever on a carpet instead of chairs that is the chief change between now and then but i think we would never punish anyone poor criminal give him another chance it only makes a man worse to go to prison and be corrupted we punish no one no one and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands and all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day when there shall be justice as before fifty rupees a hundred a thousand till peace comes ah why didn t we live in that time but are you admiring mr fielding s house do look how the pillars are painted blue and the verandah s pavilions what do you call them that are above us inside are blue also look at the carving on the pavilions think of the hours it took their little roofs are curved to imitate bamboo so pretty and the bamboos waving by the tank outside mrs moore mrs moore
p00148_B,00148,B,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00149_B,00149,B,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00150_B,00150,B,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00151_B,00151,B,ah very likely
p00152_B,00152,B,call what a ghost
p00153_B,00153,B,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p00154_B,00154,B,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00155_B,00155,B,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00156_B,00156,B,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00157_B,00157,B,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00158_B,00158,B,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00159_B,00159,B,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00160_B,00160,B,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00161_B,00161,B,that s much the best feeling to have
p00162_B,00162,B,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00163_B,00163,B,don t you know
p00164_B,00164,B,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00165_B,00165,B,only various shades of the dark
p00166_B,00166,B,very nice
p00167_B,00167,B,ah dearest grasmere
p00168_B,00168,B,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00169_B,00169,B,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00170_B,00170,B,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00171_B,00171,B,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00172_B,00172,B,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00173_B,00173,B,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00174_B,00174,B,of course he is innocent
p00175_B,00175,B,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00176_B,00176,B,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00177_B,00177,B,a horrid stuffy place really
p00178_B,00178,B,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00179_B,00179,B,oh what of the echo
p00180_B,00180,B,india s
p00181_B,00181,B,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00182_B,00182,B,she has children you see
p00183_B,00183,B,i don t suppose you ever will
p00184_B,00184,B,later and later let me think we don t see the other side of the moon out here no
p00185_B,00185,B,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00186_B,00186,B,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00187_B,00187,B,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00188_B,00188,B,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00189_B,00189,B,yes that is so
p00190_B,00190,B,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00191_B,00191,B,ah that s true well by marrying mr heaslop i shall become what is known as an anglo indian
p00192_B,00192,B,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00193_B,00193,B,what made you call it a ghost
p00194_B,00194,B,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00195_B,00195,B,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00196_B,00196,B,was he nice
p00197_B,00197,B,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00198_B,00198,B,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00199_B,00199,B,mrs moore what is this echo
p00200_B,00200,B,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00201_B,00201,B,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00202_B,00202,B,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00203_B,00203,B,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00204_B,00204,B,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00205_B,00205,B,you see ronny i was right
p00206_B,00206,B,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00207_B,00207,B,perhaps i ought to
p00208_B,00208,B,i suppose so
p00209_B,00209,B,get in dr aziz you make us giddy if they re so foolish as to miss the train that s their loss not ours
p00210_B,00210,B,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00211_B,00211,B,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00212_B,00212,B,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00213_B,00213,B,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00214_B,00214,B,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00215_B,00215,B,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00216_B,00216,B,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00217_B,00217,B,oh yes that s true
p00218_B,00218,B,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00219_B,00219,B,i can t get rid of it
p00220_B,00220,B,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00221_B,00221,B,dr aziz what s happened to your hills the train has forgotten to stop
p00222_B,00222,B,we aren t even seeing the other side of the world that s our complaint
p00223_B,00223,B,try seeing indians
p00224_B,00224,B,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p00225_B,00225,B,i don t know he was all right when i left
p00226_B,00226,B,i m afraid i can t thanks all the same i m awfully sorry you feel i ve been remiss i didn t mean to be
p00227_B,00227,B,fancy if i d fallen or got angry
p00228_B,00228,B,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p00229_B,00229,B,i really can t see the harm
p00230_B,00230,B,i m sorry what s up
p00231_B,00231,B,oh well come along now and take your ladies away the catastrophe over
p00232_B,00232,B,i shall go round at once
p00233_B,00233,B,she stopped as she smokes by her own wish old man
p00234_B,00234,B,my old das is all right
p00235_B,00235,B,our schoolmaster government college
p00236_B,00236,B,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p00237_B,00237,B,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00238_B,00238,B,but i want to see them
p00239_B,00239,B,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00240_B,00240,B,oh lucky you
p00241_B,00241,B,even from one s patients
p00242_B,00242,B,that occurs after so many meetings
p00243_B,00243,B,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00244_B,00244,B,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00245_B,00245,B,how if he went to heaven
p00246_B,00246,B,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00247_B,00247,B,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00248_B,00248,B,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00249_B,00249,B,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00250_B,00250,B,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00251_B,00251,B,i suppose he is guilty can i possibly have made a mistake
p00252_B,00252,B,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00253_B,00253,B,you won t
p00254_B,00254,B,you re bound to win
p00255_B,00255,B,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00256_B,00256,B,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00257_B,00257,B,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00258_B,00258,B,miss quested what a name
p00259_B,00259,B,harry is there any news from the city
p00260_B,00260,B,i should think i did champagne too
p00261_B,00261,B,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00262_B,00262,B,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00263_B,00263,B,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00264_B,00264,B,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00265_B,00265,B,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00266_B,00266,B,quite so not till monday
p00267_B,00267,B,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00268_B,00268,B,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00269_B,00269,B,everything absolutely normal
p00270_B,00270,B,india does wonders for the judgment especially during the hot weather it has even done wonders for fielding
p00271_B,00271,B,she s saying her prayers
p00272_B,00272,B,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00273_B,00273,B,i don t hate them i don t know why
p00274_B,00274,B,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00275_B,00275,B,come along mary get it over
p00276_B,00276,B,will all ladies leave the smoking room now please and remember what i have said we look to you to help us through a difficult time and you can help us by behaving as if everything is normal it is all i ask can i rely on you
p00277_B,00277,B,do come quietly mary
p00278_B,00278,B,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00279_B,00279,B,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00280_B,00280,B,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00281_B,00281,B,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00282_B,00282,B,but she thinks it
p00283_B,00283,B,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00284_B,00284,B,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00285_B,00285,B,didn t she
p00286_B,00286,B,oh naturally
p00287_B,00287,B,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00288_B,00288,B,the marabar caves
p00289_B,00289,B,oh no ronny it has red bars on its wings
p00290_B,00290,B,i know but
p00291_B,00291,B,have you been to them
p00292_B,00292,B,but ronny i heard her
p00293_B,00293,B,good evening
p00294_B,00294,B,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00295_B,00295,B,i thought there was to be no polo
p00296_B,00296,B,have i really
p00297_B,00297,B,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00298_B,00298,B,not a bit
p00299_B,00299,B,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00300_B,00300,B,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00301_B,00301,B,my echo s better
p00302_B,00302,B,i don t know the animals any better than the birds here too big for a goat
p00303_B,00303,B,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00304_B,00304,B,quite so
p00305_B,00305,B,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00306_B,00306,B,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00307_B,00307,B,oughtn t we to get back to the bungalow
p00308_B,00308,B,the idea more than the words
p00309_B,00309,B,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00310_B,00310,B,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00311_B,00311,B,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00312_B,00312,B,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00313_B,00313,B,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00314_B,00314,B,we didn t skid we ran into an animal
p00315_B,00315,B,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00316_B,00316,B,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00317_B,00317,B,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00318_B,00318,B,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00319_B,00319,B,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00320_B,00320,B,so am i i m useless at everything
p00321_B,00321,B,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00322_B,00322,B,i think we shall keep friends
p00323_B,00323,B,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00324_B,00324,B,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00325_B,00325,B,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00326_B,00326,B,what animal
p00327_B,00327,B,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00328_B,00328,B,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00329_B,00329,B,you re over tired
p00330_B,00330,B,by jove she s right the paint s gone
p00331_B,00331,B,so you won t go saying he s innocent again will you for every servant i ve got is a spy they all hate us it ll be all right after the verdict for i will say this for them they do accept the accomplished fact but at present they re pouring out money like water to catch us tripping and a remark like yours is the very thing they look out for it would enable them to say it was a put up job on the part of us officials you see what i mean
p00332_B,00332,B,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00333_B,00333,B,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00334_B,00334,B,she never mentioned that name once
p00335_B,00335,B,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00336_B,00336,B,no but i know all about them naturally
p00337_B,00337,B,well sit down anyhow
p00338_B,00338,B,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00339_B,00339,B,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00340_B,00340,B,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00341_B,00341,B,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00342_B,00342,B,i know we shall
p00343_B,00343,B,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00344_B,00344,B,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00345_B,00345,B,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00346_B,00346,B,who cares what she thinks
p00347_B,00347,B,not allowed
p00348_B,00348,B,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p00349_B,00349,B,i say adela what was it
p00350_B,00350,B,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00351_B,00351,B,heard what
p00352_B,00352,B,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00353_B,00353,B,you were not right she never said it
p00354_B,00354,B,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00355_B,00355,B,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00356_B,00356,B,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00357_B,00357,B,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00358_B,00358,B,out where
p00359_B,00359,B,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00360_B,00360,B,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00361_B,00361,B,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00362_B,00362,B,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00363_B,00363,B,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00364_B,00364,B,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00365_B,00365,B,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00366_B,00366,B,those words
p00367_B,00367,B,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p00368_B,00368,B,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00369_B,00369,B,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00370_B,00370,B,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00371_B,00371,B,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p00372_B,00372,B,dear old girl to say so
p00373_B,00373,B,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00374_B,00374,B,mother never said so
p00375_B,00375,B,as we are british i suppose it is
p00376_B,00376,B,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00377_B,00377,B,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00378_B,00378,B,but you ll find her irritable we are an irritable family well you ll see for yourself no doubt my own nerves are out of order and i expected more from mother when i came in from the office than she felt able to give she is sure to make a special effort for you still i don t want your home coming to be a disappointing one don t expect too much
p00379_B,00379,B,come along and let s tell the mater all this
p00380_B,00380,B,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00381_B,00381,B,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00382_B,00382,B,my duties here are evidently finished i don t want to see india now now for my passage back
p00383_B,00383,B,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00384_B,00384,B,red nine on black ten
p00385_B,00385,B,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00386_B,00386,B,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00387_B,00387,B,why should i be in the witness box
p00388_B,00388,B,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00389_B,00389,B,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00390_B,00390,B,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00391_B,00391,B,i want my pack of patience cards
p00392_B,00392,B,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00393_B,00393,B,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00394_B,00394,B,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00395_B,00395,B,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00396_B,00396,B,crocodiles down in it too how terrible what a terrible river what a wonderful river
p00397_B,00397,B,but my dear boy
p00398_B,00398,B,not talk about him why
p00399_B,00399,B,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00400_B,00400,B,between the acts
p00401_B,00401,B,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00402_B,00402,B,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00403_B,00403,B,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00404_B,00404,B,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00405_B,00405,B,your sentiments are those of a god
p00406_B,00406,B,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00407_B,00407,B,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00408_B,00408,B,i don t know what you mean dear
p00409_B,00409,B,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00410_B,00410,B,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00411_B,00411,B,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00412_B,00412,B,pretty dear
p00413_B,00413,B,most feeble
p00414_B,00414,B,ah yes so the young man there said
p00415_B,00415,B,a doctor i don t know his name
p00416_B,00416,B,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00417_B,00417,B,a ghost
p00418_B,00418,B,how not true
p00419_B,00419,B,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00420_B,00420,B,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00421_B,00421,B,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00422_B,00422,B,she has started the machinery it will work to its end
p00423_B,00423,B,yes quite after the first moment
p00424_B,00424,B,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00425_B,00425,B,i suppose so i suppose so
p00426_B,00426,B,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00427_B,00427,B,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00428_B,00428,B,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00429_B,00429,B,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00430_B,00430,B,an accident
p00431_B,00431,B,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00432_B,00432,B,what do you mean
p00433_B,00433,B,can t mother
p00434_B,00434,B,i have changed my mind
p00435_B,00435,B,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00436_B,00436,B,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00437_B,00437,B,how do you make that out mother
p00438_B,00438,B,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00439_B,00439,B,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00440_B,00440,B,been there when
p00441_B,00441,B,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00442_B,00442,B,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00443_B,00443,B,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00444_B,00444,B,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00445_B,00445,B,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00446_B,00446,B,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00447_B,00447,B,yes rather i must in fact
p00448_B,00448,B,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00449_B,00449,B,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00450_B,00450,B,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00451_B,00451,B,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00452_B,00452,B,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00453_B,00453,B,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00454_B,00454,B,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00455_B,00455,B,she is certainly ageing and i ought not to be vexed with anything she says
p00456_B,00456,B,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00457_B,00457,B,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00458_B,00458,B,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00459_B,00459,B,you oughtn t to have answered
p00460_B,00460,B,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00461_B,00461,B,feeble mother feeble
p00462_B,00462,B,who was he
p00463_B,00463,B,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00464_B,00464,B,very well get them
p00465_B,00465,B,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00466_B,00466,B,india isn t home
p00467_B,00467,B,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00468_B,00468,B,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00469_B,00469,B,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00470_B,00470,B,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00471_B,00471,B,we can go into that later can t we
p00472_B,00472,B,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00473_B,00473,B,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00474_B,00474,B,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00475_B,00475,B,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00476_B,00476,B,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00477_B,00477,B,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00478_B,00478,B,i know
p00479_B,00479,B,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00480_B,00480,B,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00481_B,00481,B,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00482_B,00482,B,india likes gods
p00483_B,00483,B,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00484_B,00484,B,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00485_B,00485,B,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00486_B,00486,B,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p00487_B,00487,B,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00488_B,00488,B,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00489_B,00489,B,i do not expect i shall make myself cheap i do not see why we should make ourselves cheap i do not see why we should the invitation is worded very graciously till tuesday then gentlemen all when i hope we may meet in the flower gardens of the club
p00490_B,00490,B,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00491_B,00491,B,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00492_B,00492,B,pepper civil surgeon said so they hope to destroy us one by one they shall fail
p00493_B,00493,B,you will make yourself chip
p00494_B,00494,B,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00495_B,00495,B,mr ram chand
p00496_B,00496,B,mr mahmoud ali
p00497_B,00497,B,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00498_B,00498,B,the educated indians will be no good to us if there s a row it s simply not worth while conciliating them that s why they don t matter most of the people you see are seditious at heart and the rest ld run squealing the cultivator he s another story the pathan he s a man if you like but these people don t imagine they re india
p00499_B,00499,B,i didn t mean that
p00500_B,00500,B,absolutely true
p00501_B,00501,B,all right i said don t apologize
p00502_B,00502,B,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00503_B,00503,B,this isn t a purdah party

p00505_B,00505,B,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00506_B,00506,B,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00507_B,00507,B,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00508_B,00508,B,but now we can talk how delightful
p00509_B,00509,B,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00510_B,00510,B,but mrs turton
p00511_B,00511,B,oh really
p00512_B,00512,B,how about aspirin
p00513_B,00513,B,yes my dear child
p00514_B,00514,B,do kindly tell us who these ladies are
p00515_B,00515,B,you re superior to them anyway don t forget that you re superior to everyone in india except one or two of the ranis and they re on an equality is that what you wanted
p00516_B,00516,B,why fancy she understands
p00517_B,00517,B,oh yes they re english speaking
p00518_B,00518,B,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00519_B,00519,B,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00520_B,00520,B,the shorter lady she is my wife she is mrs bhattacharya the taller lady she is my sister she is mrs das
p00521_B,00521,B,i believe that you have oh please it distresses me beyond words
p00522_B,00522,B,i wonder whether you would allow us to call on you some day
p00523_B,00523,B,all hours
p00524_B,00524,B,all days are convenient
p00525_B,00525,B,we shall enjoy it greatly it would be a real pleasure what about the time
p00526_B,00526,B,oh do you oh but if you do we shall find you gone
p00527_B,00527,B,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00528_B,00528,B,we leave for calcutta to day
p00529_B,00529,B,but you ll be in calcutta
p00530_B,00530,B,no no we shall not we expect you thursday
p00531_B,00531,B,no of course not we are not such people
p00532_B,00532,B,don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit
p00533_B,00533,B,i ll see him first if you prefer
p00534_B,00534,B,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else
p00535_B,00535,B,i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there
p00536_B,00536,B,what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination
p00537_B,00537,B,what madness there s supposed to be a riot on the police have struck no one knows what ll happen next why don t you keep to your own people
p00538_B,00538,B,you put it honestly anyhow
p00539_B,00539,B,where you like how should i know your arrangements
p00540_B,00540,B,but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air
p00541_B,00541,B,i m rather a hermit you know
p00542_B,00542,B,i won t ask the city magistrate to bring you i know he ll be busy at that time
p00543_B,00543,B,you can t wander about like that where s the car you came in
p00544_B,00544,B,thank goodness that s over
p00545_B,00545,B,i suppose so
p00546_B,00546,B,you can t it s too late how are you to get round to the private entrance now come this way with me quick i ll put you into my carriage
p00547_B,00547,B,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00548_B,00548,B,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00549_B,00549,B,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00550_B,00550,B,i wouldn t worry about that
p00551_B,00551,B,i fear not
p00552_B,00552,B,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00553_B,00553,B,i don t go to that length
p00554_B,00554,B,how could she have known what we don t
p00555_B,00555,B,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00556_B,00556,B,she s an old lady
p00557_B,00557,B,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00558_B,00558,B,we english do
p00559_B,00559,B,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00560_B,00560,B,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00561_B,00561,B,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00562_B,00562,B,if heaven existed
p00563_B,00563,B,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00564_B,00564,B,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00565_B,00565,B,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00566_B,00566,B,aziz was so fond of her too
p00567_B,00567,B,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00568_B,00568,B,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00569_B,00569,B,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00570_B,00570,B,i think he should come in this time do ask him to come
p00571_B,00571,B,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00572_B,00572,B,good bye miss quested
p00573_B,00573,B,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00574_B,00574,B,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p00575_B,00575,B,it ll get us to heaven
p00576_B,00576,B,i no longer want love
p00577_B,00577,B,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00578_B,00578,B,not much
p00579_B,00579,B,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00580_B,00580,B,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00581_B,00581,B,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00582_B,00582,B,do you care to meet one or two
p00583_B,00583,B,write to me when you get to england
p00584_B,00584,B,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00585_B,00585,B,i don t know
p00586_B,00586,B,of course this death has been troubling me
p00587_B,00587,B,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00588_B,00588,B,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00589_B,00589,B,how can that be
p00590_B,00590,B,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00591_B,00591,B,someone who was in another cave and followed me when the guide was looking away possibly
p00592_B,00592,B,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p00593_B,00593,B,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00594_B,00594,B,does he tell me to come out to him
p00595_B,00595,B,and nasty
p00596_B,00596,B,much the best thing to be in this place
p00597_B,00597,B,yes ronny is always hard worked
p00598_B,00598,B,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00599_B,00599,B,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00600_B,00600,B,i do so hate mysteries
p00601_B,00601,B,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00602_B,00602,B,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00603_B,00603,B,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00604_B,00604,B,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00605_B,00605,B,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00606_B,00606,B,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00607_B,00607,B,so do i
p00608_B,00608,B,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00609_B,00609,B,because the dead don t live again
p00610_B,00610,B,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00611_B,00611,B,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00612_B,00612,B,ought i to join them
p00613_B,00613,B,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p00614_B,00614,B,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it
p00615_B,00615,B,exactly what mr heaslop tells me if one doesn t worry how s one to understand
p00616_B,00616,B,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00617_B,00617,B,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00618_B,00618,B,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00619_B,00619,B,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday
p00620_B,00620,B,but where am i to go in it
p00621_B,00621,B,telepathy possibly
p00622_B,00622,B,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00623_B,00623,B,i shall walk
p00624_B,00624,B,i shall often you have been excessively kind now that i m going i realize it i wish i could do something for you in return but i see you ve all you want
p00625_B,00625,B,will it
p00626_B,00626,B,do i like anyone though
p00627_B,00627,B,oh that would be very nice
p00628_B,00628,B,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00629_B,00629,B,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00630_B,00630,B,the guide
p00631_B,00631,B,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00632_B,00632,B,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00633_B,00633,B,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00634_B,00634,B,why indeed
p00635_B,00635,B,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00636_B,00636,B,perhaps it was the guide
p00637_B,00637,B,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00638_B,00638,B,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00639_B,00639,B,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00640_B,00640,B,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00641_B,00641,B,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00642_B,00642,B,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00643_B,00643,B,sir excuse me i did i mounted my bike and it bust in front of the cow hospital so i had to find a tonga
p00644_B,00644,B,i beg your pardon
p00645_B,00645,B,i must tell that to mahmoud ali it ll make him laugh
p00646_B,00646,B,oh lord oh lord when i live here and you live there not ten minutes from me and the cow hospital is right ever so far away the other side of you there then how did you come to be passing the cow hospital on the way to me now do some work for a change
p00647_B,00647,B,bust in front of the cow hospital did it and how did you come to be there
p00648_B,00648,B,dr lal
p00649_B,00649,B,how unhappy i am how unhappy i am
p00650_B,00650,B,i go or not as i please
p00651_B,00651,B,and so much my dear rafi for your cholera
p00652_B,00652,B,but dr lal consider how could i send my servant when you were coming you come we go my house is left alone my servant comes back perhaps and all my portable property has been carried away by bad characters in the meantime would you have that the cook is deaf i can never count on my cook and the boy is only a little boy never never do i and hassan leave the house at the same time together it is my fixed rule
p00653_B,00653,B,i am so awfully sorry i was compelled to go to the post office

p00663_B,00663,B,i beg pardon but some might say your leg kicks
p00664_B,00664,B,yet you promise me and then fabricate this tale of a telegram go forward dapple
p00665_B,00665,B,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00666_B,00666,B,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p00667_B,00667,B,dr aziz
p00668_B,00668,B,i don t know
p00669_B,00669,B,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this
p00670_B,00670,B,tell him also i have nothing to say to him but he is indeed a wise boy and has always one indian friend i partly love him because he brought me back to you to say good bye for this is good bye cyril though to think about it will spoil our ride and make us sad
p00671_B,00671,B,just as i have two boys and a girl so has mrs moore she told me in the mosque
p00672_B,00672,B,hamidullah liked them in england here we never look at them oh no much too careful let s talk of something else
p00673_B,00673,B,don t trouble i ll bike
p00674_B,00674,B,cyril i have had an idea which will satisfy your tender mind i shall consult mrs moore her opinion will solve everything i can trust her so absolutely if she advises me to pardon this girl i shall do so she will counsel me nothing against my real and true honour as you might
p00675_B,00675,B,in my usual health
p00676_B,00676,B,i can rest the whole day thanks to worthy dr lal major callendar s spy i suppose you know but this time it didn t work i am allowed to have a slight temperature
p00677_B,00677,B,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife
p00678_B,00678,B,i thought you might end in england
p00679_B,00679,B,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00680_B,00680,B,but you haven t children
p00681_B,00681,B,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00682_B,00682,B,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00683_B,00683,B,i don t want to hear your long talks
p00684_B,00684,B,millions of paths my dear fellow
p00685_B,00685,B,clear out all you turtons and burtons we wanted to know you ten years back now it s too late if we see you and sit on your committees it s for political reasons don t you make any mistake clear out clear out i say why are we put to so much suffering we used to blame you now we blame ourselves we grow wiser until england is in difficulties we keep silent but in the next european war aha aha then is our time
p00686_B,00686,B,but i always thought that englishmen kept their rooms so tidy it seems that this is not so i need not be so ashamed everything ranged coldly on shelves was what i thought i say mr fielding is the stud going to go in
p00687_B,00687,B,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00688_B,00688,B,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00689_B,00689,B,why don t you marry miss quested
p00690_B,00690,B,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00691_B,00691,B,caring has nothing to do with it
p00692_B,00692,B,oh yes i remember an excessively aged lady but will you please repeat the name of her companion
p00693_B,00693,B,exactly got a cigarette
p00694_B,00694,B,before you go for you are evidently in a great hurry will you please unlock that drawer do you see a piece of brown paper at the top
p00695_B,00695,B,and pray what is wrong with my attitude
p00696_B,00696,B,has she indeed i am so glad

p00698_B,00698,B,do i mispronounce that well known name is he not your wife s brother
p00699_B,00699,B,he is a most powerful man
p00700_B,00700,B,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das
p00701_B,00701,B,how much do you make out of yours
p00702_B,00702,B,i know nothing at all about the religion here i should never think of watching it myself
p00703_B,00703,B,one minute again
p00704_B,00704,B,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00705_B,00705,B,take mine take mine
p00706_B,00706,B,perhaps some day just now i see mrs moore and what s her name coming
p00707_B,00707,B,she would have wanted me if she was ill to attend her
p00708_B,00708,B,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00709_B,00709,B,to those other children
p00710_B,00710,B,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00711_B,00711,B,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00712_B,00712,B,explain in detail
p00713_B,00713,B,do you contradict my last remark
p00714_B,00714,B,oh rather most helpful
p00715_B,00715,B,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00716_B,00716,B,poetry let us discuss why poetry has lost the power of making men brave my mother s father was also a poet and fought against you in the mutiny i might equal him if there was another mutiny as it is i am a doctor who has won a case and has three children to support and whose chief subject of conversation is official plans
p00717_B,00717,B,i expected you to make such a reply you are a faithful friend shall we now talk about something else
p00718_B,00718,B,yes yes one minute
p00719_B,00719,B,i do not consider mrs moore my friend i only met her accidentally in my mosque a single meeting is too short to make a friend
p00720_B,00720,B,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00721_B,00721,B,not the least i ll send an embrocation over to the guest house i heard you were settled in there
p00722_B,00722,B,let them sing it
p00723_B,00723,B,it is useless discussing hindus with me living with them teaches me no more when i think i annoy them i do not when i think i don t annoy them i do perhaps they will sack me for tumbling on to their dolls house on the other hand perhaps they will double my salary time will prove why so curious about them
p00724_B,00724,B,i ve not don t be ridiculous
p00725_B,00725,B,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00726_B,00726,B,most certainly i am not
p00727_B,00727,B,but speaking out may get you into trouble
p00728_B,00728,B,jolly good poems i m getting published bombay side
p00729_B,00729,B,prig prig kindly explain isn t that a bad word
p00730_B,00730,B,what is hampstead
p00731_B,00731,B,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00732_B,00732,B,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology
p00733_B,00733,B,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00734_B,00734,B,what s that last sentence please will you teach me some new words and so improve my english let me put in your stud i see the shirt back s hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity
p00735_B,00735,B,perhaps your letter never reached the minister in question
p00736_B,00736,B,when you called me a little rotter
p00737_B,00737,B,no so let us have a talk let us dream plans for the future

p00746_B,00746,B,i will not really and besides your position makes it dangerous for you you can t be too careful in every way mr fielding whatever you say or do in this damned country there is always some envious fellow on the look out you may be surprised to know that there were at least three spies sitting here when you came to enquire i was really a good deal upset that you talked in that fashion about god they will certainly report it
p00747_B,00747,B,there goes a queer chap i trust he won t come to grief

p00765_B,00765,B,i am looking though it gets a bit dark i see cyril fielding to be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend but in some ways a fool you think that by letting miss quested off easily i shall make a better reputation for myself and indians generally no no it will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion officially i have decided to have nothing more to do with british india as a matter of fact i shall seek service in some moslem state such as hyderabad bhopal where englishmen cannot insult me any more don t counsel me otherwise
p00766_B,00766,B,oh it s nothing she was not a highly educated woman or even beautiful but put it away you would have seen her so why should you not see her photograph

p00817_B,00817,B,it s all over the town and may injure your reputation you know everyone is by no means your supporter i have tried all i could to silence such a story
p00818_B,00818,B,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00819_B,00819,B,cyril you sometimes make a sensible remark that will do for poetry for the present let us now return to your english visit
p00820_B,00820,B,oh i beg your pardon i m sure the licentious oriental imagination was at work
p00821_B,00821,B,will she sign that
p00822_B,00822,B,oho the deccani brahman
p00823_B,00823,B,as what

p00825_B,00825,B,and there she lives in comfort you will enjoy seeing her dear me i ve got a headache this evening perhaps i am going to have cholera with your permission i ll leave early
p00826_B,00826,B,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00827_B,00827,B,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00828_B,00828,B,who on earth do you suppose i ve married
p00829_B,00829,B,but you haven t got your bicycle my carriage fetched you let it take you away
p00830_B,00830,B,aziz how monstrous
p00831_B,00831,B,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00832_B,00832,B,your unfairness is worse than my materialism
p00833_B,00833,B,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00834_B,00834,B,there ll be a general move at chandrapore
p00835_B,00835,B,willingly what subject

p00837_B,00837,B,then the guide came back to you
p00838_B,00838,B,miss quested will be greatly pleased i am glad you have seen her courage at last
p00839_B,00839,B,i do worry on your account i consider they have been impolite she had no right to dash away from your party and miss derek had no right to abet her
p00840_B,00840,B,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00841_B,00841,B,an artistic and thoughtful little suburb of london

p00847_B,00847,B,yes to my eternal confusion you know how fond i am of you
p00848_B,00848,B,i hae ma doots
p00849_B,00849,B,i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit
p00850_B,00850,B,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00851_B,00851,B,anyhow you want to rest
p00852_B,00852,B,exactly and no oars
p00853_B,00853,B,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00854_B,00854,B,i am only going for a little time on official business my service is anxious to get me away from chandrapore for a bit it is obliged to value me highly but does not care for me the situation is somewhat humorous
p00855_B,00855,B,miss quested
p00856_B,00856,B,i shall not really be intimate with this fellow nor with anyone
p00857_B,00857,B,callendar doesn t trust anyone english or indian that s his character and i wish you weren t under him but you are and that s that
p00858_B,00858,B,it simply doesn t affect me spies are as thick as mosquitoes but it s years before i shall meet the one that kills me you ve something else in your mind
p00859_B,00859,B,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00860_B,00860,B,who on earth is mr quested
p00861_B,00861,B,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00862_B,00862,B,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00863_B,00863,B,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00864_B,00864,B,many thanks
p00865_B,00865,B,are you making anything out of your life here
p00866_B,00866,B,have you a spare one
p00867_B,00867,B,that s a notion
p00868_B,00868,B,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one
p00869_B,00869,B,and when the whole world behaves as such there will be no more purdah
p00870_B,00870,B,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00871_B,00871,B,you know me by sight then
p00872_B,00872,B,i m sorry to say mrs moore s dead
p00873_B,00873,B,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00874_B,00874,B,you re not offended
p00875_B,00875,B,yes that sounds sense
p00876_B,00876,B,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00877_B,00877,B,because not a soul s been near us since we arrived
p00878_B,00878,B,there is something in religion that may not be true but has not yet been sung
p00879_B,00879,B,not if you re wearing it yourself
p00880_B,00880,B,besides the ladies i am expecting one of my assistants narayan godbole

p00882_B,00882,B,who is in charge of the guest house
p00883_B,00883,B,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you
p00884_B,00884,B,but you saw them get down safe
p00885_B,00885,B,you have you re cross with me about something or other

p00887_B,00887,B,bring das to me
p00888_B,00888,B,thanks for telling me that yes i must try and be more careful if i m interested i m apt to forget myself still it doesn t do real harm
p00889_B,00889,B,i hope she wasn t ill
p00890_B,00890,B,yes and what do they say free our women and india will be free try it my lad free your own lady in the first place and see who ll wash ahmed karim and jamila s faces a nice situation

p00892_B,00892,B,if you won t talk about the marabar to stella why won t you talk to ralph he is a wise boy really and same metaphor he rides a little behind her though with her
p00893_B,00893,B,hindus are unable to sing
p00894_B,00894,B,i have not heard of other children
p00895_B,00895,B,are you not coming down yourself how goes it aziz

p00899_B,00899,B,who do you want instead of the english the japanese
p00900_B,00900,B,oh leave it alone like all gossip it s merely one of those half alive things that try to crowd out real life take no notice it ll vanish like poor old mrs moore s tombs

p00905_B,00905,B,i knew her so slightly
p00906_B,00906,B,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz
p00907_B,00907,B,if i do i do i shall survive it i travel light
p00908_B,00908,B,no you won t

p00935_B,00935,B,as far as i do mind i travel light
p00936_B,00936,B,why don t you fellows run a club in chandrapore aziz
p00937_B,00937,B,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here

p00939_B,00939,B,what s that
p00940_B,00940,B,is there a path off the top
p00941_B,00941,B,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00942_B,00942,B,including knowing me
p00943_B,00943,B,i told you he s no good
p00944_B,00944,B,i m coming back this way and don t argue excuse manners but i don t know anyone s position send my carriage back any time to morrow if you please

p00946_B,00946,B,i ve stamped on my last collar stud
p00947_B,00947,B,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00948_B,00948,B,yes certainly you must let off miss quested easily she must pay all your costs that is only fair but do not treat her like a conquered enemy
p00949_B,00949,B,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00950_B,00950,B,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00951_B,00951,B,you would have allowed me to see her
p00952_B,00952,B,not very listen to mine at the conference it was settled
p00953_B,00953,B,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00954_B,00954,B,to whom
p00955_B,00955,B,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00956_B,00956,B,now what is the matter
p00957_B,00957,B,this really is the end and i gave her the final blow
p00958_B,00958,B,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00959_B,00959,B,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00960_B,00960,B,you little rotter well i m damned amusement indeed is it likely at such a time
p00961_B,00961,B,i don t know perhaps she might tell you she won t tell me she has ideas i don t share indeed when i m away from her i think them ridiculous when i m with her i suppose because i m fond of her i feel different i feel half dead and half blind my wife s after something you and i and miss quested are roughly speaking not after anything we jog on as decently as we can you a little in front a laudable little party but my wife is not with us
p00962_B,00962,B,all four
p00963_B,00963,B,oh your hindu friends will like that won t they
p00964_B,00964,B,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00965_B,00965,B,let us discuss that to morrow morning
p00966_B,00966,B,you re five feet nine inches high
p00967_B,00967,B,what s happened
p00968_B,00968,B,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00969_B,00969,B,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p00970_B,00970,B,gokul is the village where krishna was born well more or less born for there s the same hovering between it and another village as between bethlehem and nazareth what i want to discover is its spiritual side if it has one
p00971_B,00971,B,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00972_B,00972,B,away from us indians go to seed at once look at the king emperor high school look at you forgetting your medicine and going back to charms look at your poems
p00973_B,00973,B,we ll discuss m l at dinner
p00974_B,00974,B,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00975_B,00975,B,they can t well move me down whatever their feelings
p00976_B,00976,B,it s often done so in the past
p00977_B,00977,B,it will indeed be arranged
p00978_B,00978,B,you are coming to dinner with me as arranged i don t stand this you are coming to dinner with me you come
p00979_B,00979,B,don t bother miss quested has cleared out at last
p00980_B,00980,B,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00981_B,00981,B,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00982_B,00982,B,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00983_B,00983,B,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00984_B,00984,B,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00985_B,00985,B,as dismay and anxiety
p00986_B,00986,B,my proverbs are a penny saved is a penny earned a stitch in time saves nine look before you leap and the british empire rests on them you will never kick us out you know until you cease employing m l s and such
p00987_B,00987,B,when would you like the carriage
p00988_B,00988,B,but the way i said it must be cleared up i was unintentionally rude unreserved regrets
p00989_B,00989,B,what a shame you leave india so soon oh do reconsider your decision do stay
p00990_B,00990,B,you are absolutely unlike the others i assure you you will never be rude to my people
p00991_B,00991,B,yes all that is settled i invite you all to see me in the marabar caves
p00992_B,00992,B,she is not in chandrapore just now
p00993_B,00993,B,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p00994_B,00994,B,yes indeed three
p00995_B,00995,B,perhaps it is a circular train and goes back to chandrapore without a break who knows
p00996_B,00996,B,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p00997_B,00997,B,on which my heartiest congratulations

p01003_B,01003,B,then you are told a lie come along
p01004_B,01004,B,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01005_B,01005,B,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01006_B,01006,B,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01007_B,01007,B,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p01008_B,01008,B,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english

p01015_B,01015,B,i am to blame i am the host
p01016_B,01016,B,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start
p01017_B,01017,B,ralph and stella yes i know everything about them but we must not forget to visit our caves one of the dreams of my life is accomplished in having you both here as my guests you cannot imagine how you have honoured me i feel like the emperor babur

p01030_B,01030,B,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean

p01047_B,01047,B,oh do you feel that dr aziz i hope you re not right there will have to be something universal in this country i don t say religion for i m not religious but something or how else are barriers to be broken down take my own case i don t know whether you happen to have heard but i m going to marry mr heaslop

p01064_B,01064,B,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p01065_B,01065,B,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01066_B,01066,B,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01067_B,01067,B,oh do you think so mr fielding

p01078_B,01078,B,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly
p01079_B,01079,B,oh no
p01080_B,01080,B,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p01081_B,01081,B,never be angry with me i am as far as my limitations permit your true friend besides it is my holy festival
p01082_B,01082,B,no i should not quite say that
p01083_B,01083,B,oh no oh no
p01084_B,01084,B,did he since when
p01085_B,01085,B,mangoes mangoes

p01089_B,01089,B,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01090_B,01090,B,why did you not tell me your silence plunged me into a pretty pickle
p01091_B,01091,B,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01092_B,01092,B,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01093_B,01093,B,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01094_B,01094,B,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01095_B,01095,B,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01096_B,01096,B,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01097_B,01097,B,no not large
p01098_B,01098,B,i may sing now
p01099_B,01099,B,something like the caves at elephanta
p01100_B,01100,B,no i ve not even heard of them
p01101_B,01101,B,are they large caves
p01102_B,01102,B,do describe them professor godbole
p01103_B,01103,B,we hear nothing interesting up at the club only tennis and ridiculous gossip
p01104_B,01104,B,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01105_B,01105,B,don t trouble to come mother we re just starting
p01106_B,01106,B,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p01107_B,01107,B,what should have upset his precious nerves
p01108_B,01108,B,let him go
p01109_B,01109,B,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01110_B,01110,B,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01111_B,01111,B,i am most frightfully cut up
p01112_B,01112,B,thanks so much what was that
p01113_B,01113,B,yes alas
p01114_B,01114,B,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01115_B,01115,B,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01116_B,01116,B,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01117_B,01117,B,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01118_B,01118,B,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01119_B,01119,B,a name a name for a school
p01120_B,01120,B,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01121_B,01121,B,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01122_B,01122,B,yes yes
p01123_B,01123,B,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01124_B,01124,B,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01125_B,01125,B,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01126_B,01126,B,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01127_B,01127,B,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01128_B,01128,B,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01129_B,01129,B,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01130_B,01130,B,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01131_B,01131,B,i cannot say i was not present
p01132_B,01132,B,oh yes
p01133_B,01133,B,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01134_B,01134,B,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01135_B,01135,B,oh yes that is all round the college
p01136_B,01136,B,that is good then you saw the tank of the dagger dagger fell from his hand and to commemorate miracle he built tank
p01137_B,01137,B,but he comes in some other song i hope
p01138_B,01138,B,oh no he refuses to come i say to him come come come come come come he neglects to come
p01139_B,01139,B,what was that about caves
p01140_B,01140,B,my fault that i told him to come this way because the road s better mr lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills
p01141_B,01141,B,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p01142_B,01142,B,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p01143_B,01143,B,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p01144_B,01144,B,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p01145_B,01145,B,he may show you some aspect of the country i can t and he s a real loyalist i thought you might care for a bit of a change
p01146_B,01146,B,not at all
p01147_B,01147,B,wasn t the bridge we skidded
p01148_B,01148,B,what s the damage
p01149_B,01149,B,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p01150_B,01150,B,all over oh yes the danger is past let us smoke cigarettes let us do anything we please oh yes enjoy ourselves oh my merciful god
p01151_B,01151,B,exactly you wish to borrow this electric torch
p01152_B,01152,B,i have sahib i have
p01153_B,01153,B,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p01154_B,01154,B,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01155_B,01155,B,ah now i begin to understand
p01156_B,01156,B,how do you do
p01157_B,01157,B,a large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us
p01158_B,01158,B,i believe it was a buffalo
p01159_B,01159,B,by jove sir your lady is right
p01160_B,01160,B,you give me five minutes time i ll take you any dam anywhere
p01161_B,01161,B,frightened adela
p01162_B,01162,B,excellent a hyena mr harris
p01163_B,01163,B,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p01164_B,01164,B,an animal
p01165_B,01165,B,exactly too big for a goat
p01166_B,01166,B,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p01167_B,01167,B,nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle i shall despatch him with all possible speed meanwhile repair my car
p01168_B,01168,B,sahib says hyena
p01169_B,01169,B,we ran into a hyena
p01170_B,01170,B,really i had no idea
p01171_B,01171,B,it s just a trick and they happened to pull it off now one sees why they had mahmoud ali just to make a scene on the chance it is his speciality
p01172_B,01172,B,we ve had a breakdown
p01173_B,01173,B,can you give us a lift
p01174_B,01174,B,i m afraid it s very upsetting for you
p01175_B,01175,B,well that s good
p01176_B,01176,B,how absolutely rotten
p01177_B,01177,B,mr heaslop how disgraceful dragging in your dear mother
p01178_B,01178,B,isn t it all queer
p01179_B,01179,B,but how putrid
p01180_B,01180,B,yes indeed
p01181_B,01181,B,not the least i don t mind it
p01182_B,01182,B,don t worry about me i m much better than i was i don t feel the least faint i shall be all right and thank you all thank you thank you for your kindness
p01183_B,01183,B,take me too
p01184_B,01184,B,i will sit in front
p01185_B,01185,B,i would scarcely call her wrong a native state a hindu state the wife of a ruler of a hindu state may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady and let it not be for a moment supposed that i suggest anything against the character of her highness the maharani of mudkul but i fear she will be uneducated i fear she will be superstitious indeed how could she be otherwise what opportunity of education has such a lady had oh superstition is terrible terrible oh it is the great defect in our indian character oh it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off and though i have little experience of hindu states and none of this particular one namely mudkul the ruler i fancy has a salute of but eleven guns yet i cannot imagine that they have been as successful as british india where we see reason and orderliness spreading in every direction like a most health giving flood
p01186_B,01186,B,heh what about me
p01187_B,01187,B,now what s all this i m not an omnibus i ve a harmonium and two dogs in here with me as it is i ll take three of you if one ll sit in front and nurse a pug no more
p01188_B,01188,B,i don t believe in these people letting you down if i didn t snatch like the devil i should be nowhere he doesn t want the car silly fool surely it s to the credit of his state i should be seen about in it at chandrapore during my leave he ought to look at it that way anyhow he s got to look at it that way my maharani s different my maharani s a dear that s her fox terrier poor little devil i fished them out both with the driver imagine taking dogs to a chiefs conference as sensible as taking chiefs perhaps the harmonium the harmonium s my little mistake i own they rather had me over the harmonium i meant it to stop on the train oh lor they always sack me before that happens and then i get another job the whole of india seethes with maharanis and ranis and begums who clamour for such as me
p01189_B,01189,B,then hop in i ve no notion who you are
p01190_B,01190,B,heh no what about my dinner i can t be left alone all the night

p01221_B,01221,B,forgive my mistakes
p01222_B,01222,B,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01223_B,01223,B,all illness proceeds from hindus
p01224_B,01224,B,don t talk to him like that he doesn t want it and he doesn t want three chairs he s not three englishmen rafi come here sit down again i m delighted you could come with mr hamidullah my dear boy it will help me to recover seeing you

p01227_B,01227,B,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01228_B,01228,B,and how much illness there is in the city
p01229_B,01229,B,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01230_B,01230,B,here he lies
p01231_B,01231,B,we know how busy you are
p01232_B,01232,B,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01233_B,01233,B,it is only my duty
p01234_B,01234,B,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01235_B,01235,B,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01236_B,01236,B,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01237_B,01237,B,yes that is true
p01238_B,01238,B,h morrhoids
p01239_B,01239,B,it is only a boy
p01240_B,01240,B,i think not much
p01241_B,01241,B,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01242_B,01242,B,even boys must learn
p01243_B,01243,B,it is not the end of time it is scarcely ten thirty ha ha gentlemen if i may be allowed to say a few words what an interesting talk also thankfulness and gratitude to mr fielding in the first place teaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his experience and judgment
p01244_B,01244,B,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01245_B,01245,B,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01246_B,01246,B,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01247_B,01247,B,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01248_B,01248,B,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01249_B,01249,B,nor you the advantage of conducting their cases in the courts any longer
p01250_B,01250,B,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01251_B,01251,B,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01252_B,01252,B,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01253_B,01253,B,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p01254_B,01254,B,oh that is true how true
p01255_B,01255,B,does mr fielding think it s true
p01256_B,01256,B,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01257_B,01257,B,i guess they do i got in first
p01258_B,01258,B,none chuck em out
p01259_B,01259,B,it will come
p01260_B,01260,B,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01261_B,01261,B,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01262_B,01262,B,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01263_B,01263,B,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p01264_B,01264,B,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01265_B,01265,B,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p01266_B,01266,B,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01267_B,01267,B,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01268_B,01268,B,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01269_B,01269,B,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01270_B,01270,B,at once
p01271_B,01271,B,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p01272_B,01272,B,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01273_B,01273,B,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01274_B,01274,B,she died at sea
p01275_B,01275,B,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01276_B,01276,B,well i don t believe in providence
p01277_B,01277,B,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01278_B,01278,B,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01279_B,01279,B,gladly in a minute
p01280_B,01280,B,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01281_B,01281,B,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01282_B,01282,B,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01283_B,01283,B,yes definitely
p01284_B,01284,B,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01285_B,01285,B,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01286_B,01286,B,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01287_B,01287,B,ah ah has some evidence come
p01288_B,01288,B,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01289_B,01289,B,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01290_B,01290,B,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01291_B,01291,B,it was insulting of him not to come in
p01292_B,01292,B,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01293_B,01293,B,we hear sir that your mother has died may we ask where the cable came from
p01294_B,01294,B,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01295_B,01295,B,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01296_B,01296,B,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01297_B,01297,B,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01298_B,01298,B,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01299_B,01299,B,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01300_B,01300,B,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01301_B,01301,B,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01302_B,01302,B,the heat i suppose
p01303_B,01303,B,no no the existence of providence
p01304_B,01304,B,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01305_B,01305,B,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01306_B,01306,B,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01307_B,01307,B,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01308_B,01308,B,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01309_B,01309,B,oh this is unbearable
p01310_B,01310,B,and does not morality also decline
p01311_B,01311,B,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01312_B,01312,B,but how then can you believe in god
p01313_B,01313,B,i don t believe in god
p01314_B,01314,B,oh that is true how true
p01315_B,01315,B,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01316_B,01316,B,come along we tire the invalid in either case
p01317_B,01317,B,i quite understand
p01318_B,01318,B,godbole s pujah did it
p01319_B,01319,B,i don t know whether this suits you but anyhow you re safe
p01320_B,01320,B,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01321_B,01321,B,master told me to come
p01322_B,01322,B,well your ladies won t have you do get rid of him dr aziz
p01323_B,01323,B,mistress tells you to go
p01324_B,01324,B,you spick lie
p01325_B,01325,B,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01326_B,01326,B,merciful god
p01327_B,01327,B,i spick a lie oh jolly good isn t he a funny old man we will have great jokes with him later he does all sorts of little things he is not nearly as stupid as you think and awfully poor it s lucky ours is a large family but you get inside make yourselves at home yes you lie down excuse me now i must meet our other two guests
p01328_B,01328,B,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01329_B,01329,B,we re monkeys don t worry mr fielding mr fielding
p01330_B,01330,B,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01331_B,01331,B,aziz can i have a drink
p01332_B,01332,B,on what charge do you arrest him
p01333_B,01333,B,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01334_B,01334,B,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p01335_B,01335,B,hullo some mistake
p01336_B,01336,B,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01337_B,01337,B,i am under instructions not to say
p01338_B,01338,B,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01339_B,01339,B,ah thank god he comes
p01340_B,01340,B,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01341_B,01341,B,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde
p01342_B,01342,B,i shall certainly come sir and i am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over me may i venture to ask where miss quested is
p01343_B,01343,B,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01344_B,01344,B,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01345_B,01345,B,oh no oh no no
p01346_B,01346,B,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01347_B,01347,B,may i conclude my statement
p01348_B,01348,B,may i make a statement sir
p01349_B,01349,B,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01350_B,01350,B,then she s mad
p01351_B,01351,B,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01352_B,01352,B,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01353_B,01353,B,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01354_B,01354,B,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01355_B,01355,B,it is no good we all build upon sand and the more modern the country gets the worse ll be the crash in the old eighteenth century when cruelty and injustice raged an invisible power repaired their ravages everything echoes now there s no stopping the echo the original sound may be harmless but the echo is always evil
p01356_B,01356,B,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01357_B,01357,B,she escaped by god s grace
p01358_B,01358,B,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01359_B,01359,B,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01360_B,01360,B,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01361_B,01361,B,worse and worse appalling
p01362_B,01362,B,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01363_B,01363,B,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01364_B,01364,B,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01365_B,01365,B,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01366_B,01366,B,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01367_B,01367,B,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01368_B,01368,B,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01369_B,01369,B,wife indeed i know those wives
p01370_B,01370,B,i hardly think that would do surely
p01371_B,01371,B,city magistrate
p01372_B,01372,B,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01373_B,01373,B,yes one can t very well worry poor heaslop photographs of women ah
p01374_B,01374,B,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01375_B,01375,B,sort of all white thing the burra sahib would do we shall all have to hang together old man i m afraid i m your junior in years i know but very much your senior in service you don t happen to know this poisonous country as well as i do and you must take it from me that the general situation is going to be nasty at chandrapore during the next few weeks very nasty indeed
p01376_B,01376,B,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01377_B,01377,B,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01378_B,01378,B,his own people seem in touch with him all right
p01379_B,01379,B,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01380_B,01380,B,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01381_B,01381,B,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01382_B,01382,B,a bit too finespun anyhow callendar won t hear of you seeing her i m sorry to say he gave a bad account just now he says that she is by no means out of danger i must put this report through now fielding
p01383_B,01383,B,what difference does that make
p01384_B,01384,B,innocence or guilt why mix yourself up what s the good
p01385_B,01385,B,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01386_B,01386,B,well she tells her own story doesn t she
p01387_B,01387,B,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01388_B,01388,B,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01389_B,01389,B,have a look at them
p01390_B,01390,B,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01391_B,01391,B,i wouldn t keep you waiting good heavens you take precedence of any indian visitor of course i meant what s the good why mix yourself up with pitch
p01392_B,01392,B,how can i not
p01393_B,01393,B,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01394_B,01394,B,how do you know that
p01395_B,01395,B,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01396_B,01396,B,possibly my wife might ask her that much
p01397_B,01397,B,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01398_B,01398,B,it s all a mistake
p01399_B,01399,B,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01400_B,01400,B,that sounds comfortable
p01401_B,01401,B,i don t follow
p01402_B,01402,B,that s his wife
p01403_B,01403,B,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01404_B,01404,B,so i have just told you
p01405_B,01405,B,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01406_B,01406,B,i see what you mean
p01407_B,01407,B,well when he s done with them
p01408_B,01408,B,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01409_B,01409,B,was a guide not with her
p01410_B,01410,B,can i visit aziz
p01411_B,01411,B,i wish you wouldn t
p01412_B,01412,B,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01413_B,01413,B,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01414_B,01414,B,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01415_B,01415,B,i know but she tells it to you
p01416_B,01416,B,to whom do i apply for an order
p01417_B,01417,B,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01418_B,01418,B,did she say any more
p01419_B,01419,B,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01420_B,01420,B,i say he s innocent
p01421_B,01421,B,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01422_B,01422,B,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01423_B,01423,B,he told me
p01424_B,01424,B,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01425_B,01425,B,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01426_B,01426,B,why don t one think more of other people
p01427_B,01427,B,then they ve started
p01428_B,01428,B,mr mcbryde s down there disguised as a holy man
p01429_B,01429,B,any more questions necessary questions
p01430_B,01430,B,that s exactly the sort of thing that must not be said mrs callendar be more careful than that please in these times
p01431_B,01431,B,i well i
p01432_B,01432,B,is the where is he
p01433_B,01433,B,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p01434_B,01434,B,and a jolly suggestion the army s got to come in sooner or later a special train was in his mind inseparable from troops this would never have happened if barabas hill was under military control station a bunch of gurkhas at the entrance of the cave was all that was wanted
p01435_B,01435,B,english no good native troops for this country give me the sporting type of native give me gurkhas give me rajputs give me jats give me the punjabi give me sikhs give me marathas bhils afridis and pathans and really if it comes to that i don t mind if you give me the scums of the bazaars properly led mind i d lead them anywhere
p01436_B,01436,B,exactly what i said the native s all right if you get him alone lesley lesley you remember the one i had a knock with on your maidan last month well he was all right any native who plays polo is all right what you ve got to stamp on is these educated classes and mind i do know what i m talking about this time
p01437_B,01437,B,don t start carrying arms about i want everything to go on precisely as usual until there s cause for the contrary get the womenfolk off to the hills but do it quietly and for heaven s sake no more talk of special trains never mind what you think or feel possibly i have feelings too one isolated indian has attempted is charged with an attempted crime act upon that fact until there are more facts assume every indian is an angel
p01438_B,01438,B,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01439_B,01439,B,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01440_B,01440,B,how s the old lady
p01441_B,01441,B,why should it
p01442_B,01442,B,does anyone here present want to
p01443_B,01443,B,squat down callendar tell us all about it
p01444_B,01444,B,sorry old man
p01445_B,01445,B,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01446_B,01446,B,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01447_B,01447,B,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01448_B,01448,B,take me some time to do that
p01449_B,01449,B,heaslop s just behind me
p01450_B,01450,B,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01451_B,01451,B,no what about him
p01452_B,01452,B,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p01453_B,01453,B,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01454_B,01454,B,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01455_B,01455,B,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01456_B,01456,B,i do i do i m satisfied
p01457_B,01457,B,that s ridiculous
p01458_B,01458,B,then what do you mean
p01459_B,01459,B,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01460_B,01460,B,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01461_B,01461,B,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01462_B,01462,B,how is your mother old boy
p01463_B,01463,B,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01464_B,01464,B,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01465_B,01465,B,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01466_B,01466,B,some have never got up
p01467_B,01467,B,das is really
p01468_B,01468,B,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01469_B,01469,B,not one of them s all right
p01470_B,01470,B,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01471_B,01471,B,stand up you swine
p01472_B,01472,B,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01473_B,01473,B,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01474_B,01474,B,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01475_B,01475,B,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01476_B,01476,B,i must come before someone
p01477_B,01477,B,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01478_B,01478,B,i cannot be sure
p01479_B,01479,B,may i have half a minute before i reply to that mr mcbryde
p01480_B,01480,B,that is quite correct
p01481_B,01481,B,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01482_B,01482,B,is it
p01483_B,01483,B,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01484_B,01484,B,i know where you mean
p01485_B,01485,B,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01486_B,01486,B,why should he write to me
p01487_B,01487,B,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01488_B,01488,B,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01489_B,01489,B,you went alone into one of those caves
p01490_B,01490,B,i beg your pardon
p01491_B,01491,B,i didn t catch that answer you are on that landing or whatever we term it and you have entered a cave i suggest to you that the prisoner followed you what do you mean please
p01492_B,01492,B,what nature of mistake
p01493_B,01493,B,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01494_B,01494,B,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01495_B,01495,B,and the prisoner followed you
p01496_B,01496,B,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01497_B,01497,B,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01498_B,01498,B,he s a crank a crank
p01499_B,01499,B,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p01500_B,01500,B,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p01501_B,01501,B,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01502_B,01502,B,exactly and remember it afterwards you men you re weak weak weak why they ought to crawl from here to the caves on their hands and knees whenever an englishwoman s in sight they oughtn t to be spoken to they ought to be spat at they ought to be ground into the dust we ve been far too kind with our bridge parties and the rest weak weak
p01503_B,01503,B,at last some sense is being talked
p01504_B,01504,B,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01505_B,01505,B,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01506_B,01506,B,turn that man out
p01507_B,01507,B,do you feel faint adela
p01508_B,01508,B,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01509_B,01509,B,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01510_B,01510,B,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01511_B,01511,B,that s better
p01512_B,01512,B,are you all right yourselves
p01513_B,01513,B,now we ve got im
p01514_B,01514,B,we shall do we shall do
p01515_B,01515,B,oh cut the cackle and let s have the verdict
p01516_B,01516,B,well done das quite sound
p01517_B,01517,B,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01518_B,01518,B,i should object a platform confers authority
p01519_B,01519,B,even when it s one foot high so come along all
p01520_B,01520,B,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01521_B,01521,B,are you mad
p01522_B,01522,B,give me time to consider
p01523_B,01523,B,prisoner s dupes
p01524_B,01524,B,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01525_B,01525,B,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01526_B,01526,B,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01527_B,01527,B,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01528_B,01528,B,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01529_B,01529,B,all the marabar caves are jain
p01530_B,01530,B,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01531_B,01531,B,this is no way to defend your case
p01532_B,01532,B,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01533_B,01533,B,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01534_B,01534,B,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01535_B,01535,B,do so this trial is a farce i am going aziz aziz farewell for ever
p01536_B,01536,B,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01537_B,01537,B,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01538_B,01538,B,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01539_B,01539,B,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01540_B,01540,B,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01541_B,01541,B,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01542_B,01542,B,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01543_B,01543,B,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01544_B,01544,B,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01545_B,01545,B,i withdraw everything
p01546_B,01546,B,dr aziz never
p01547_B,01547,B,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01548_B,01548,B,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01549_B,01549,B,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01550_B,01550,B,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01551_B,01551,B,right i withdraw
p01552_B,01552,B,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p01553_B,01553,B,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01554_B,01554,B,no sir this is an honour for us
p01555_B,01555,B,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01556_B,01556,B,cyril again you desert
p01557_B,01557,B,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p01558_B,01558,B,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01559_B,01559,B,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01560_B,01560,B,perfectly right
p01561_B,01561,B,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01562_B,01562,B,at last
p01563_B,01563,B,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01564_B,01564,B,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01565_B,01565,B,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01566_B,01566,B,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01567_B,01567,B,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01568_B,01568,B,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01569_B,01569,B,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01570_B,01570,B,he wants you of course
p01571_B,01571,B,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01572_B,01572,B,twenty thousand rupees
p01573_B,01573,B,aziz are you awake
p01574_B,01574,B,i see
p01575_B,01575,B,there was not but there may be when you have written a poem you are our hero the whole city is behind you irrespective of creed
p01576_B,01576,B,happy the man who can compose both
p01577_B,01577,B,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p01578_B,01578,B,it is not for hindus but indians generally
p01579_B,01579,B,i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul
p01580_B,01580,B,professor godbole often mentioned it before his departure for mau
p01581_B,01581,B,he too was a poet do you not divine each other
p01582_B,01582,B,there is no such person in existence as the general indian
p01583_B,01583,B,i know but will it last
p01584_B,01584,B,you are full of compliments to day
p01585_B,01585,B,my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke
p01586_B,01586,B,no no what nonsense excellent
p01587_B,01587,B,half a sec here you are is not this better than a poem
p01588_B,01588,B,oh well about this poem how did you hear i sometimes scribbled
p01589_B,01589,B,how did he hear
p01590_B,01590,B,one old englishwoman and one little little wasp it does not seem much still it is more than i am myself
p01591_B,01591,B,put powdered glass in their pan
p01592_B,01592,B,ahmed come here for such wickedness
p01593_B,01593,B,i m only ralph moore
p01594_B,01594,B,quested quested don t you know that my wife was mrs moore s daughter perhaps this explains your odd attitude
p01595_B,01595,B,no pain
p01596_B,01596,B,can you always tell whether a stranger is your friend
p01597_B,01597,B,what what do you mean
p01598_B,01598,B,they have not gone in the direction of mau i hope on a night like this the people become most fanatical
p01599_B,01599,B,excellent news
p01600_B,01600,B,certainly not it returns to my dispensary at once now do you want me to treat your stings or do you prefer an english doctor there is one at asirgarh asirgarh is forty miles away and the ringnod dam broken now you see how you are placed i think i had better see mr fielding about you this is really great nonsense your present behaviour
p01601_B,01601,B,state doctor ridden over to enquire very little english
p01602_B,01602,B,but there s no rajah nothing
p01603_B,01603,B,i d rather not go nearer they have such strange customs and might hurt you
p01604_B,01604,B,like what
p01605_B,01605,B,aha you know my name i see yes i am aziz no of course your great friend miss quested did me no harm at the marabar
p01606_B,01606,B,what the devil have my hands to do with you this is a most strange remark i am a qualified doctor who will not hurt you
p01607_B,01607,B,come here please allow me to look
p01608_B,01608,B,i have brought you some salve but how to put it on in your present nervous state becomes a problem
p01609_B,01609,B,i can t tell you what that is i m sure his highness is dead i think we should go back at once shall we go back now
