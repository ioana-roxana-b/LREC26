p00000_A,00000,A,i can tell you nothing aunt juley i know no more than you do we met we only met the father and mother abroad last spring i know so little that i didn t even know their son s name it s all so
p00001_A,00001,A,in that case it is far too sudden
p00002_A,00002,A,who knows aunt juley who knows
p00003_A,00003,A,but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely
p00004_A,00004,A,who knows
p00005_A,00005,A,but margaret dear
p00006_A,00006,A,i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street
p00007_A,00007,A,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret
p00008_A,00008,A,the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know
p00009_A,00009,A,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do
p00010_A,00010,A,exactly germans are too thorough
p00011_A,00011,A,of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone and that reminds me helen s letter
p00012_A,00012,A,oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down
p00013_A,00013,A,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather
p00014_A,00014,A,i gathered nothing
p00015_A,00015,A,then in that case
p00016_A,00016,A,in that case i can make no plans don t you see
p00017_A,00017,A,on the contrary
p00018_A,00018,A,i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby
p00019_A,00019,A,then in that case my dear why go down i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you
p00020_A,00020,A,aunt juley i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering
p00021_A,00021,A,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them
p00022_A,00022,A,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk
p00023_A,00023,A,dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters
p00024_A,00024,A,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say
p00025_A,00025,A,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to
p00026_A,00026,A,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off
p00027_A,00027,A,i think probably it must but slowly
p00028_A,00028,A,can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different
p00029_A,00029,A,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me
p00030_A,00030,A,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong
p00031_A,00031,A,so uncivilised
p00032_A,00032,A,oh i used an affected word i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen
p00033_A,00033,A,i want a house its name is howards lodge do you know where it is
p00034_A,00034,A,mr wilcox she s wanting howards end
p00035_A,00035,A,excuse me asking but are you the younger mr wilcox or the elder
p00036_A,00036,A,the younger can i do anything for you
p00037_A,00037,A,i am miss schlegel s aunt i ought to introduce myself oughtn t i my name is mrs munt

p00041_A,00041,A,my niece is not with you by any chance
p00042_A,00042,A,no i came over with my father he has gone on north in your train you ll see miss schlegel at lunch you re coming up to lunch i hope
p00043_A,00043,A,i should like to come up
p00044_A,00044,A,in front or behind which do you prefer it may be windy in front
p00045_A,00045,A,in front if i may then we can talk
p00046_A,00046,A,but excuse me one moment i can t think what they re doing with that parcel hi hi you there are you going to keep me waiting all day parcel for wilcox howards end just look sharp this station s abominably organised if i had my way the whole lot of em should get the sack may i help you in
p00047_A,00047,A,this is very good of you very good indeed it is just what i should have wished
p00048_A,00048,A,very good of you to say so i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train
p00049_A,00049,A,you see we heard from helen this morning
p00050_A,00050,A,extremely sorry mrs munt
p00051_A,00051,A,not at all mr wilcox
p00052_A,00052,A,and do you object to going through the village it is rather a longer spin but i have one or two commissions
p00053_A,00053,A,i should love going through the village naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you you can well imagine that the news was a great shock to us
p00054_A,00054,A,what news
p00055_A,00055,A,mr wilcox margaret has told me everything everything i have seen helen s letter
p00056_A,00056,A,i beg your pardon i didn t catch
p00057_A,00057,A,about helen helen of course helen is a very exceptional person i am sure you will let me say this feeling towards her as you do indeed all the schlegels are exceptional i come in no spirit of interference but it was a great shock
p00058_A,00058,A,i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads
p00059_A,00059,A,margaret could not come herself on account of poor tibby so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk
p00060_A,00060,A,i m sorry to be so dense but i still haven t quite understood
p00061_A,00061,A,helen mr wilcox my niece and you
p00062_A,00062,A,miss schlegel and myself
p00063_A,00063,A,i trust there has been no misunderstanding her letter certainly read that way
p00064_A,00064,A,what way
p00065_A,00065,A,that you and she
p00066_A,00066,A,i think i catch your meaning what an extraordinary mistake
p00067_A,00067,A,then you didn t the least
p00068_A,00068,A,scarcely as i am already engaged to another lady oh good god don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s
p00069_A,00069,A,but you are paul
p00070_A,00070,A,i m not
p00071_A,00071,A,then why did you say so at the station
p00072_A,00072,A,i said nothing of the sort i beg your pardon i did not my name is charles do you mean to tell me that paul do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece
p00073_A,00073,A,yes they care for one another very much indeed i dare say they will tell you about it by and by we heard this morning
p00074_A,00074,A,the idiot the idiot the little fool
p00075_A,00075,A,if that is your attitude mr wilcox i prefer to walk
p00076_A,00076,A,i beg you will do no such thing i take you up this moment to the house let me tell you the thing s impossible and must be stopped
p00077_A,00077,A,i quite agree sir the thing is impossible and i will come up and stop it my niece is a very exceptional person and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her considering she has only known your brother since wednesday and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel
p00078_A,00078,A,could you possibly lower your voice the shopman will overhear i warn you paul hasn t a penny it s useless
p00079_A,00079,A,no need to warn us mr wilcox i assure you the warning is all the other way my niece has been very foolish and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me
p00080_A,00080,A,he has to make his way out in nigeria he couldn t think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate and is in other ways why hasn t he told us of course he s ashamed he knows he s been a fool and so he has a downright fool whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news
p00081_A,00081,A,if i were a man mr wilcox for that last remark i d box your ears you re not fit to clean my niece s boots to sit in the same room with her and you dare you actually dare i decline to argue with such a person
p00082_A,00082,A,all i know is she s spread the thing and he hasn t and my father s away and i
p00083_A,00083,A,and all that i know is
p00084_A,00084,A,don t let them know they are never to know
p00085_A,00085,A,oh my darling helen
p00086_A,00086,A,paul paul paul is there any truth in this
p00087_A,00087,A,i didn t i don t
p00088_A,00088,A,charles dear charles dear charles one doesn t ask plain questions there aren t such things miss schlegel would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room whichever you think best paul do find evie and tell her lunch for six but i m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it
p00089_A,00089,A,mother are you aware that paul has been playing the fool again
p00090_A,00090,A,why be so polite to servants they don t understand it
p00091_A,00091,A,i understand at least i understand as much as ever is understood of these things tell me now what happened on the monday morning
p00092_A,00092,A,it was over at once
p00093_A,00093,A,how helen
p00094_A,00094,A,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times
p00095_A,00095,A,was paul there
p00096_A,00096,A,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness
p00097_A,00097,A,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife
p00098_A,00098,A,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew
p00099_A,00099,A,knew what
p00100_A,00100,A,everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think
p00101_A,00101,A,oh she must have overheard you
p00102_A,00102,A,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that
p00103_A,00103,A,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end
p00104_A,00104,A,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes
p00105_A,00105,A,don t you feel it now
p00106_A,00106,A,do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst
p00107_A,00107,A,to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within
p00108_A,00108,A,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p00109_A,00109,A,whom is margaret talking to would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in
p00110_A,00110,A,i expect so
p00111_A,00111,A,you girls are so wonderful in always having oh dear one mustn t talk
p00112_A,00112,A,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p00113_A,00113,A,on the what dear
p00114_A,00114,A,on the drum aunt juley
p00115_A,00115,A,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p00116_A,00116,A,margaret is helen all right
p00117_A,00117,A,oh yes
p00118_A,00118,A,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00119_A,00119,A,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00120_A,00120,A,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00121_A,00121,A,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p00122_A,00122,A,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p00123_A,00123,A,tibby love you must go
p00124_A,00124,A,it isn t of any consequence
p00125_A,00125,A,my sister is so careless
p00126_A,00126,A,not at all
p00127_A,00127,A,if you would give me your address
p00128_A,00128,A,oh not at all not at all
p00129_A,00129,A,that is where we live if you preferred you could call for the umbrella after the concert but i didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault
p00130_A,00130,A,it s a fine programme this afternoon is it not
p00131_A,00131,A,what what the pomp and circumstance will not be fine
p00132_A,00132,A,oh margaret you tiresome girl here have i been persuading herr liesecke to stop for pomp and circumstance and you are undoing all my work i am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in music oh you musn t run down our english composers margaret
p00133_A,00133,A,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00134_A,00134,A,frieda you despise english music you know you do and english art and english literature except shakespeare and he s a german very well frieda you may go
p00135_A,00135,A,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00136_A,00136,A,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
p00137_A,00137,A,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus
p00138_A,00138,A,might i couldn t i
p00139_A,00139,A,we live quite near i am going there now could you walk round with me and we ll find your umbrella
p00140_A,00140,A,thank you
p00141_A,00141,A,how tired one gets after music
p00142_A,00142,A,do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive
p00143_A,00143,A,yes horribly
p00144_A,00144,A,but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive
p00145_A,00145,A,do you go there much
p00146_A,00146,A,i do in a way remember the passage tibby but when every instrument is so beautiful it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another i am sure that you and helen take me to the very nicest concerts not a dull note from beginning to end i only wish that our german friends had stayed till it finished
p00147_A,00147,A,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p00148_A,00148,A,a specially loud part of course i do not go in for being musical i only care for music a very different thing but still i will say this for myself i do know when i like a thing and when i don t some people are the same about pictures they can go into a picture gallery miss conder can and say straight off what they feel all round the wall i never could do that but music is so different from pictures to my mind when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything there was a thing something about a faun in french which helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
p00149_A,00149,A,do you agree do you think music is so different from pictures
p00150_A,00150,A,i i should have thought so kind of
p00151_A,00151,A,so should i now my sister declares they re just the same we have great arguments over it she says i m dense i say she s sloppy now doesn t it seem absurd to you what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music it s very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process but what s gained i d like to know oh it s all rubbish radically false if monet s really debussy and debussy s really monet neither gentleman is worth his salt that s my opinion now this very symphony that we ve just been having she won t let it alone she labels it with meanings from start to finish turns it into literature i wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music yet i don t know there s my brother behind us he treats music as music and oh my goodness he makes me angrier than any one simply furious with him i daren t even argue but of course the real villain is wagner he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts i do feel that music is in a very serious state just now though extraordinarily interesting every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses like wagner who stir up all the wells of thought at once for a moment it s splendid such a splash as never was but afterwards such a lot of mud and the wells as it were they communicate with each other too easily now and not one of them will run quite clear that s what wagner s done
p00152_A,00152,A,helen let us in
p00153_A,00153,A,all right
p00154_A,00154,A,you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella
p00155_A,00155,A,taken a what oh what s that do come in how do you do
p00156_A,00156,A,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p00157_A,00157,A,don t you talk meg you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat yes she did aunt juley it is a positive fact she thought it was a muff oh heavens i ve knocked the in and out card down where s frieda tibby why don t you ever no i can t remember what i was going to say that wasn t it but do tell the maids to hurry tea up what about this umbrella no it s all gone along the seams it s an appalling umbrella it must be mine
p00158_A,00158,A,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p00159_A,00159,A,whatever have i done
p00160_A,00160,A,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p00161_A,00161,A,oh do stop
p00162_A,00162,A,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00163_A,00163,A,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p00164_A,00164,A,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00165_A,00165,A,why he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well
p00166_A,00166,A,better that he had
p00167_A,00167,A,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p00168_A,00168,A,all right auntie tibby
p00169_A,00169,A,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p00170_A,00170,A,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p00171_A,00171,A,oh it s no good looking superior i mean what i say
p00172_A,00172,A,leave tibby alone
p00173_A,00173,A,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00174_A,00174,A,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00175_A,00175,A,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p00176_A,00176,A,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00177_A,00177,A,a touch of the w s perhaps
p00178_A,00178,A,who are the w s
p00179_A,00179,A,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00180_A,00180,A,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00181_A,00181,A,that house being the w s house i presume
p00182_A,00182,A,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p00183_A,00183,A,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p00184_A,00184,A,if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go even at queen victoria s dinner party if something had been just a little different perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin
p00185_A,00185,A,with an india shawl over her shoulders
p00186_A,00186,A,fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin
p00187_A,00187,A,how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art

p00222_A,00222,A,when s your birthday len
p00223_A,00223,A,i ve told you again and again the eleventh of november next now get off my knee a bit some one must get supper i suppose it really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted it makes one feel so wild when i ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife all right all right you shall be my wife and i ve bought you the ring to wear and i ve taken this flat furnished and it s far more than i can afford and yet you aren t content and i ve also not told the truth when i ve written home he d stop it my brother d stop it i m going against the whole world jacky that s what i am jacky i don t take any heed of what any one says i just go straight forward i do that s always been my way i m not one of your weak knock kneed chaps if a woman s in trouble i don t leave her in the lurch that s not my street no thank you i ll tell you another thing too i care a good deal about improving myself by means of literature and art and so getting a wider outlook for instance when you came in i was reading ruskin s stones of venice i don t say this to boast but just to show you the kind of man i am i can tell you i enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon
p00224_A,00224,A,but you do love me don t you
p00225_A,00225,A,you in bed
p00226_A,00226,A,all right
p00227_A,00227,A,i must clean my boots ready for the morning i rather want to get this chapter done
p00228_A,00228,A,what what s that
p00229_A,00229,A,oh but helen isn t a girl with no interests she has plenty of other things and other people to think about she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them
p00230_A,00230,A,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow
p00231_A,00231,A,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us i didn t tell you at the time it might have made you angry and you had enough to worry you but i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them she didn t answer it
p00232_A,00232,A,how very rude
p00233_A,00233,A,i wonder or was it sensible
p00234_A,00234,A,no margaret most rude
p00235_A,00235,A,in either case one can class it as reassuring
p00236_A,00236,A,but you will be careful won t you
p00237_A,00237,A,oh certainly fiendishly careful
p00238_A,00238,A,careful over what aunt juley
p00239_A,00239,A,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p00240_A,00240,A,of course i don t mind it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there s nothing to be grave about at all
p00241_A,00241,A,i m not grave
p00242_A,00242,A,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p00243_A,00243,A,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p00244_A,00244,A,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00245_A,00245,A,hark i hear bruno entering the hall
p00246_A,00246,A,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00247_A,00247,A,come helen
p00248_A,00248,A,helen cannot deceive me she does mind
p00249_A,00249,A,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p00250_A,00250,A,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be
p00251_A,00251,A,mr wilcox possibly
p00252_A,00252,A,i knew it and there s mr wilcox
p00253_A,00253,A,it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans
p00254_A,00254,A,it s as well to be prepared
p00255_A,00255,A,because because i d sooner risk it
p00256_A,00256,A,but imagine the evenings turn the electric light on here or there and it s almost the same room one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you ll see them and the next you yours and they ll see you impossible to sit out on the balconies impossible to water the plants or even speak imagine going out of the front door and they come out opposite at the same moment and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you d rather risk it
p00257_A,00257,A,i hope to risk things all my life
p00258_A,00258,A,oh margaret most dangerous
p00259_A,00259,A,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money
p00260_A,00260,A,oh shame what a shocking speech
p00261_A,00261,A,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none
p00262_A,00262,A,but this is something quite new
p00263_A,00263,A,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin
p00264_A,00264,A,i call that rather cynical
p00265_A,00265,A,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them
p00266_A,00266,A,that s more like socialism
p00267_A,00267,A,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality
p00268_A,00268,A,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh
p00269_A,00269,A,what is it
p00270_A,00270,A,helen was looking up at the wilcoxes flat
p00271_A,00271,A,why shouldn t she
p00272_A,00272,A,i beg your pardon i interrupted you what was it you were saying about reality
p00273_A,00273,A,i had worked round to myself as usual
p00274_A,00274,A,do tell me this at all events are you for the rich or for the poor
p00275_A,00275,A,too difficult ask me another am i for poverty or for riches for riches hurrah for riches
p00276_A,00276,A,for riches
p00277_A,00277,A,yes for riches money for ever
p00278_A,00278,A,so am i and so i am afraid are most of my acquaintances at swanage but i am surprised that you agree with us
p00279_A,00279,A,thank you so much aunt juley while i have talked theories you have done the flowers
p00280_A,00280,A,not at all dear i wish you would let me help you in more important things
p00281_A,00281,A,well would you be very kind would you come round with me to the registry office there s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no
p00282_A,00282,A,staring most rudely
p00283_A,00283,A,helen you must tell me whether this thing worries you
p00284_A,00284,A,if what
p00285_A,00285,A,the ws coming
p00286_A,00286,A,really i shan t mind if paul points at our house and says there lives the girl who tried to catch me but she might
p00287_A,00287,A,if even that worries you we could arrange something there s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease thanks to our money we might even go away for a little
p00288_A,00288,A,well i am going away frieda s just asked me to stettin and i shan t be back till after the new year will that do or must i fly the country altogether really meg what has come over you to make such a fuss
p00289_A,00289,A,helen his mother has forgiven you
p00290_A,00290,A,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p00291_A,00291,A,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00292_A,00292,A,most certainly her love has died
p00293_A,00293,A,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p00294_A,00294,A,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p00295_A,00295,A,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p00296_A,00296,A,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini
p00297_A,00297,A,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her
p00298_A,00298,A,yes i know thanks very much
p00299_A,00299,A,i thought i did right to tell you
p00300_A,00300,A,what s that
p00301_A,00301,A,oh mrs wilcox i have made the baddest blunder i am more more ashamed and sorry than i can say i knew he was going to india in november but i forgot
p00302_A,00302,A,he sailed on the 17th for nigeria in africa
p00303_A,00303,A,i knew i know i have been too absurd all through i am very much ashamed i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me
p00304_A,00304,A,it doesn t matter miss schlegel it is good of you to have come round so promptly
p00305_A,00305,A,she has just gone to germany
p00306_A,00306,A,she gone as well yes certainly it is quite safe safe absolutely now
p00307_A,00307,A,you ve been worrying too how perfectly extraordinary i can see that you have you felt as i do helen mustn t meet him again
p00308_A,00308,A,i did think it best
p00309_A,00309,A,now why
p00310_A,00310,A,that s a most difficult question i think you put it best in your letter it was an instinct which may be wrong
p00311_A,00311,A,it wasn t that your son still
p00312_A,00312,A,oh no he often my paul is very young you see
p00313_A,00313,A,then what was it
p00314_A,00314,A,an instinct which may be wrong
p00315_A,00315,A,in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn t live together that s dreadfully probable i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another
p00316_A,00316,A,these are indeed other words i had nothing so coherent in my head i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister
p00317_A,00317,A,ah i have always been wanting to ask you how did you know helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things did paul tell you
p00318_A,00318,A,there is nothing to be gained by discussing that
p00319_A,00319,A,mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it
p00320_A,00320,A,i was certainly against taking mrs matheson s flat i knew it was opposite your house
p00321_A,00321,A,but it s all right now
p00322_A,00322,A,i think so
p00323_A,00323,A,you only think you aren t sure i do love these little muddles tidied up
p00324_A,00324,A,oh yes i m sure i always sound uncertain over things it is my way of speaking
p00325_A,00325,A,that s all right and i m sure too i must say good bye now you will be getting up
p00326_A,00326,A,no please stop a little longer i am taking a day in bed now and then i do
p00327_A,00327,A,i thought of you as one of the early risers
p00328_A,00328,A,at howards end yes there is nothing to get up for in london
p00329_A,00329,A,nothing to get up for when there are all the autumn exhibitions and ysaye playing in the afternoon not to mention people
p00330_A,00330,A,the truth is i am a little tired first came the wedding and then paul went off and instead of resting yesterday i paid a round of calls
p00331_A,00331,A,a wedding
p00332_A,00332,A,we took the flat chiefly on that account and also that paul could get his african outfit the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s and she most kindly offered it to us so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly s people which we had not yet done fussell the father is in the indian army retired the brother is in the army the mother is dead charles and albert fussell have known one another some time they belong to the same club and are both devoted to golf dolly plays golf too though i believe not so well and they first met in a mixed foursome we all like her and are very much pleased they were married on the 11th a few days before paul sailed charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man so he made a great point of having it on the 11th the fussells would have preferred it after christmas but they were very nice about it there is dolly s photograph in that double frame
p00333_A,00333,A,are you quite certain that i m not interrupting mrs wilcox
p00334_A,00334,A,yes quite
p00335_A,00335,A,then i will stay i m enjoying this
p00336_A,00336,A,they have gone to naples for their honeymoon
p00337_A,00337,A,lucky people
p00338_A,00338,A,i can hardly imagine charles in italy
p00339_A,00339,A,doesn t he care for travelling
p00340_A,00340,A,he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable his father gave him a car for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end
p00341_A,00341,A,i suppose you have a garage there
p00342_A,00342,A,yes my husband built a little one only last month to the west of the house not far from the wych elm in what used to be the paddock for the pony
p00343_A,00343,A,where s the pony gone
p00344_A,00344,A,the pony oh dead ever so long ago
p00345_A,00345,A,the wych elm i remember helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree
p00346_A,00346,A,oh it might interest you there are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk about four feet from the ground the country people put them in long ago and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark it will cure the toothache the teeth are almost grown over now and no one comes to the tree
p00347_A,00347,A,i should i love folklore and all festering superstitions
p00348_A,00348,A,do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it
p00349_A,00349,A,of course it did it would cure anything once
p00350_A,00350,A,certainly i remember cases you see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it i was born there good bye miss schlegel good bye thank you for coming you have cheered me up
p00351_A,00351,A,i m so glad
p00352_A,00352,A,i i wonder whether you ever think about yourself
p00353_A,00353,A,i think of nothing else
p00354_A,00354,A,i wonder i wondered at heidelberg
p00355_A,00355,A,i m sure
p00356_A,00356,A,i almost think you forget you re a girl
p00357_A,00357,A,i m twenty nine that s not so wildly girlish what makes you say that do you mean that i have been gauche and rude
p00358_A,00358,A,i only meant that i am fifty one and that to me both of you read it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly
p00359_A,00359,A,oh i ve got it inexperience i m no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her
p00360_A,00360,A,yes you have got it inexperience is the word
p00361_A,00361,A,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p00362_A,00362,A,i hope that your sister is safe in germany by now
p00363_A,00363,A,people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses at least our cousins do but aren t particularly rich the town isn t interesting except for a clock that rolls its eyes and the view of the oder which truly is something special oh mrs wilcox you would love the oder the river or rather rivers there seem to be dozens of them are intense blue and the plain they run through an intensest green
p00364_A,00364,A,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p00365_A,00365,A,so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo
p00366_A,00366,A,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p00367_A,00367,A,they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously
p00368_A,00368,A,is anything gained by that
p00369_A,00369,A,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p00370_A,00370,A,i am not sure that i agree do you
p00371_A,00371,A,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p00372_A,00372,A,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p00373_A,00373,A,i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side
p00374_A,00374,A,the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side
p00375_A,00375,A,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p00376_A,00376,A,you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs
p00377_A,00377,A,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p00378_A,00378,A,then you ought to discussion keeps a house alive it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone
p00379_A,00379,A,it cannot stand without them it cannot stand without them and i sometimes think but i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here
p00380_A,00380,A,never mind us or her do say
p00381_A,00381,A,i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men
p00382_A,00382,A,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00383_A,00383,A,are they i never follow any arguments i am only too thankful not to have a vote myself
p00384_A,00384,A,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00385_A,00385,A,i don t know i don t know
p00386_A,00386,A,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00387_A,00387,A,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p00388_A,00388,A,what an interesting life you all lead in london
p00389_A,00389,A,no we don t we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys mrs wilcox really we have something quiet and stable at the bottom we really have all my friends have don t pretend you enjoyed lunch for you loathed it but forgive me by coming again alone or by asking me to you
p00390_A,00390,A,i am used to young people i hear a great deal of chatter at home for we like you entertain a great deal with us it is more sport and politics but i enjoyed my lunch very much miss schlegel dear and am not pretending and only wish i could have joined in more for one thing i m not particularly well just to day for another you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me charles is the same dolly the same but we are all in the same boat old and young i never forget that
p00391_A,00391,A,first of all we must make a list and tick off the people s names my aunt always does and this fog may thicken up any moment have you any ideas
p00392_A,00392,A,i thought we would go to harrods or the haymarket stores everything is sure to be there i am not a good shopper the din is so confusing and your aunt is quite right one ought to make a list take my notebook then and write your own name at the top of the page
p00393_A,00393,A,because i ve odd ideas about christmas because i have all that money can buy i want more people but no more things
p00394_A,00394,A,i should like to give you something worth your acquaintance miss schlegel in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight it has so happened that i have been left alone and you have stopped me from brooding i am too apt to brood
p00395_A,00395,A,if that is so if i have happened to be of use to you which i didn t know you cannot pay me back with anything tangible
p00396_A,00396,A,i suppose not but one would like to perhaps i shall think of something as we go about we always give the servants money
p00397_A,00397,A,yes do you yes much easier no i do like christmas on the whole in its clumsy way it does approach peace and goodwill but oh it is clumsier every year
p00398_A,00398,A,is it i am only used to country christmases
p00399_A,00399,A,we are usually in london and play the game with vigour carols at the abbey clumsy midday meal clumsy dinner for the maids followed by christmas tree and dancing of poor children with songs from helen the drawing room does very well for that we put the tree in the powder closet and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted and with the looking glass behind it looks quite pretty i wish we might have a powder closet in our next house of course the tree has to be very small and the presents don t hang on it no the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper
p00400_A,00400,A,you spoke of your next house miss schlegel then are you leaving wickham place
p00401_A,00401,A,yes in two or three years when the lease expires we must
p00402_A,00402,A,have you been there long
p00403_A,00403,A,all our lives
p00404_A,00404,A,you will be very sorry to leave it
p00405_A,00405,A,i suppose so we scarcely realise it yet my father
p00406_A,00406,A,my husband and our daughter are motoring
p00407_A,00407,A,but couldn t you get it renewed
p00408_A,00408,A,i beg your pardon
p00409_A,00409,A,the lease i mean
p00410_A,00410,A,oh the lease have you been thinking of that all the time how very kind of you
p00411_A,00411,A,surely something could be done
p00412_A,00412,A,no values have risen too enormously they mean to pull down wickham place and build flats like yours
p00413_A,00413,A,but how horrible
p00414_A,00414,A,landlords are horrible
p00415_A,00415,A,it is monstrous miss schlegel it isn t right i had no idea that this was hanging over you i do pity you from the bottom of my heart to be parted from your house your father s house it oughtn t to be allowed it is worse than dying i would rather die than oh poor girls can what they call civilisation be right if people mayn t die in the room where they were born my dear i am so sorry howards end was nearly pulled down once it would have killed me
p00416_A,00416,A,i howards end must be a very different house to ours we are fond of ours but there is nothing distinctive about it as you saw it is an ordinary london house we shall easily find another
p00417_A,00417,A,so you think
p00418_A,00418,A,again my lack of experience i suppose i can t say anything when you take up that line mrs wilcox i wish i could see myself as you see me foreshortened into a backfisch quite the ingenue very charming wonderfully well read for my age but incapable
p00419_A,00419,A,come down with me to howards end now i want you to see it you have never seen it i want to hear what you say about it for you do put things so wonderfully
p00420_A,00420,A,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p00421_A,00421,A,a thousand thanks miss schlegel for all your help
p00422_A,00422,A,not at all
p00423_A,00423,A,well naturally he he isn t a road hog
p00424_A,00424,A,he was exceeding the speed limit i conclude he must expect to suffer with the lower animals i will come if i still may
p00425_A,00425,A,you are coming to sleep dear too it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful you are coming to stop i cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise these fogs never spread far i dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire and you will never repent joining them
p00426_A,00426,A,i shall never repent joining you
p00427_A,00427,A,mother mother
p00428_A,00428,A,evie evie my pet
p00429_A,00429,A,father i say look who s here
p00430_A,00430,A,evie dearest girl why aren t you in yorkshire
p00431_A,00431,A,why ruth what in the name of all that s wonderful are you doing here ruth
p00432_A,00432,A,oh henry dear here s a lovely surprise but let me introduce but i think you know miss schlegel
p00433_A,00433,A,oh yes but how s yourself ruth
p00434_A,00434,A,fit as a fiddle
p00435_A,00435,A,so are we and so was our car which ran a1 as far as ripon but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver
p00436_A,00436,A,miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
p00437_A,00437,A,i was saying that this fool of a driver as the policeman himself admits
p00438_A,00438,A,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00439_A,00439,A,but as we ve insured against third party risks it won t so much matter
p00440_A,00440,A,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00441_A,00441,A,henry why do people who have enough money try to get more money i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars a more inward light not so much for myself as for baby
p00442_A,00442,A,why didn t you tell me you knew of it
p00443_A,00443,A,the post s come father
p00444_A,00444,A,thanks put it down
p00445_A,00445,A,has the breakfast been all right
p00446_A,00446,A,yes thanks
p00447_A,00447,A,charles says do you want the times
p00448_A,00448,A,no i ll read it later
p00449_A,00449,A,ring if you want anything father won t you
p00450_A,00450,A,i ve all i want
p00451_A,00451,A,father s eaten nothing
p00452_A,00452,A,he s going to read his letters first i think i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday
p00453_A,00453,A,no indeed
p00454_A,00454,A,i must make a note of that i am surprised that the rector allowed it
p00455_A,00455,A,perhaps it may not be the rector s affair
p00456_A,00456,A,whose else could it be
p00457_A,00457,A,butter dolly
p00458_A,00458,A,thank you evie dear charles
p00459_A,00459,A,yes dear
p00460_A,00460,A,i didn t know one could pollard elms i thought one only pollarded willows
p00461_A,00461,A,oh no one can pollard elms
p00462_A,00462,A,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p00463_A,00463,A,another point i must speak to chalkeley
p00464_A,00464,A,yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
p00465_A,00465,A,it s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men he is responsible
p00466_A,00466,A,yes rather
p00467_A,00467,A,morning hullo my new car s been driven
p00468_A,00468,A,has it sir
p00469_A,00469,A,one minute i m busy well crane who s been driving it do you suppose
p00470_A,00470,A,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p00471_A,00471,A,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00472_A,00472,A,wait dear wait a minute who had the key of the garage while you were away crane
p00473_A,00473,A,the gardener sir
p00474_A,00474,A,do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor
p00475_A,00475,A,no sir no one s had the motor out sir
p00476_A,00476,A,then how do you account for the mud on the axle
p00477_A,00477,A,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p00478_A,00478,A,now dolly i can attend to you miss schlegel what does she want
p00479_A,00479,A,she wants howards end
p00480_A,00480,A,howards end now crane just don t forget to put on the stepney wheel
p00481_A,00481,A,no sir
p00482_A,00482,A,now mind you don t forget for i come little woman
p00483_A,00483,A,but you haven t listened charles
p00484_A,00484,A,what s wrong
p00485_A,00485,A,i keep on telling you howards end miss schlegel s got it
p00486_A,00486,A,got what what the dickens are you talking about
p00487_A,00487,A,now charles you promised not to say those naughty
p00488_A,00488,A,look here i m in no mood for foolery it s no morning for it either
p00489_A,00489,A,i tell you i keep on telling you miss schlegel she s got it your mother s left it to her and you ve all got to move out
p00490_A,00490,A,howards end
p00491_A,00491,A,dolly go back at once my father s much annoyed with you charles come in at once to father he s had a letter that s too awful
p00492_A,00492,A,schlegels again
p00493_A,00493,A,come in all three of you dolly why have you disobeyed me
p00494_A,00494,A,oh mr wilcox
p00495_A,00495,A,i told you not to go out to the garage i ve heard you all shouting in the garden i won t have it come in into the dining room every one of you we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants here charles here read these see what you make
p00496_A,00496,A,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p00497_A,00497,A,certainly i was coming out to you when dolly
p00498_A,00498,A,well let s sit down
p00499_A,00499,A,come evie don t waste time sit down
p00500_A,00500,A,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p00501_A,00501,A,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p00502_A,00502,A,give it her
p00503_A,00503,A,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p00504_A,00504,A,we know that it is not legally binding dolly we are aware of that legally i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire of course my dear we consider you as one of the family but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand
p00505_A,00505,A,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p00506_A,00506,A,i don t think that
p00507_A,00507,A,don t think what
p00508_A,00508,A,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p00509_A,00509,A,my dear father consult an expert if you like but i don t admit it is my mother s writing
p00510_A,00510,A,why you just said it was
p00511_A,00511,A,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p00512_A,00512,A,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p00513_A,00513,A,mother couldn t have meant it
p00514_A,00514,A,no my girl of course not
p00515_A,00515,A,mother believed so in ancestors too it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider who d never appreciate
p00516_A,00516,A,the whole thing is unlike her if miss schlegel had been poor if she had wanted a house i could understand it a little but she has a house of her own why should she want another she wouldn t have any use for howards end
p00517_A,00517,A,presumably she knows mother will have told her she got twice or three times into the nursing home presumably she is awaiting developments
p00518_A,00518,A,what a horrid woman
p00519_A,00519,A,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00520_A,00520,A,i wish she would i could then deal with her
p00521_A,00521,A,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p00522_A,00522,A,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p00523_A,00523,A,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p00524_A,00524,A,but those chrysanthemums
p00525_A,00525,A,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00526_A,00526,A,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00527_A,00527,A,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00528_A,00528,A,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out
p00529_A,00529,A,i have a message dear helen
p00530_A,00530,A,and there will even be some one for tibby there now tibby think of that frieda is saving up a little girl for you in pig tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries i ve talked too much my head aches now you talk
p00531_A,00531,A,i have had a correspondence with her son he was winding up the estate and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything i thought it good of him considering i knew her so little i said that she had once spoken of giving me a christmas present but we both forgot about it afterwards
p00532_A,00532,A,i hope charles took the hint
p00533_A,00533,A,i was thinking of mr vyse he never strikes me as particularly happy
p00534_A,00534,A,ye es
p00535_A,00535,A,but mr vyse is rather a wretched weedy man don t you think then there s guy that was a pitiful business besides every one is the better for some regular work i shall stick to it i am not saying it to educate you it is what i really think i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work and they must not starve it it s a new desire it goes with a great deal that s bad but in itself it s good and i hope that for women too not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago
p00536_A,00536,A,i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude
p00537_A,00537,A,then we ll leave the subject till you do i m not going to rattle you round take your time only do think over the lives of the men you like most and see how they ve arranged them
p00538_A,00538,A,i like guy and mr vyse most
p00539_A,00539,A,and don t think i m not serious because i don t use the traditional arguments making money a sphere awaiting you and so on all of which are for various reasons cant i m only your sister i haven t any authority over you and i don t want to have any just to put before you what i think the truth you see in a few years we shall be the same age practically and i shall want you to help me men are so much nicer than women
p00540_A,00540,A,labouring under such a delusion why do you not marry
p00541_A,00541,A,i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance
p00542_A,00542,A,has nobody arst you
p00543_A,00543,A,only ninnies
p00544_A,00544,A,tell me about your ninnies then
p00545_A,00545,A,they were men who had nothing better to do so take warning you must work or else you must pretend to work which is what i do work work work if you d save your soul and your body it is honestly a necessity dear boy look at the wilcoxes look at mr pembroke with all their defects of temper and understanding such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly
p00546_A,00546,A,spare me the wilcoxes
p00547_A,00547,A,i shall not they are the right sort
p00548_A,00548,A,oh goodness me meg
p00549_A,00549,A,well they re as near the right sort as you can imagine
p00550_A,00550,A,no no oh no
p00551_A,00551,A,i can t bother over results they are too difficult for me i can only look at the men an empire bores me so far but i can appreciate the heroism that builds it up london bores me but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make london
p00552_A,00552,A,what it is
p00553_A,00553,A,what it is worse luck i want activity without civilisation how paradoxical yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven
p00554_A,00554,A,and i want civilisation without activity which i expect is what we shall find in the other place
p00555_A,00555,A,if i m stupid get me back to the house hunting i ll even live in oxford if you like north oxford i ll live anywhere except bournemouth torquay and cheltenham oh yes or ilfracombe and swanage and tunbridge wells and surbiton and bedford there on no account
p00556_A,00556,A,london then
p00557_A,00557,A,oh my dears what do you think you ll never guess a woman s been here asking me for her husband her what yes for her husband and it really is so
p00558_A,00558,A,not anything to do with bracknell
p00559_A,00559,A,i offered bracknell and he was rejected so was tibby cheer up tibby it s no one we know i said oh and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier
p00560_A,00560,A,now helen what did really happen
p00561_A,00561,A,lan or len we were not nice about our vowels lanoline
p00562_A,00562,A,but what an extraordinary
p00563_A,00563,A,i said my good mrs lanoline we have some grave misunderstanding here beautiful as i am my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty and never never has mr lanoline rested his eyes on mine
p00564_A,00564,A,i hope you were pleased
p00565_A,00565,A,of course a perfectly delightful experience oh mrs lanoline s a dear she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella she mislaid him saturday afternoon and for a long time suffered no inconvenience but all night and all this morning her apprehensions grew breakfast didn t seem the same no no more did lunch and so she strolled up to 2 wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article
p00566_A,00566,A,but how on earth
p00567_A,00567,A,don t begin how on earthing she kept repeating not uncivilly but with extreme gloom in vain i asked her what she did know some knew what others knew and others didn t and then others again had better be careful oh dear she was incompetent she had a face like a silkworm and the dining room reeks of orris root we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands and i wondered where hers was too and advised her to go to the police she thanked me we agreed that mr lanoline s a notty notty man and hasn t no business to go on the lardy da but i think she suspected me up to the last bags i writing to aunt juley about this now meg remember bags i
p00568_A,00568,A,bag it by all means i m not sure that this is so funny helen it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere doesn t it
p00569_A,00569,A,i don t think so she doesn t really mind the admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy
p00570_A,00570,A,her husband may be though
p00571_A,00571,A,oh no not likely no one capable of tragedy could have married mrs lanoline
p00572_A,00572,A,was she pretty
p00573_A,00573,A,her figure may have been good once
p00574_A,00574,A,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september
p00575_A,00575,A,you wouldn t remember giving me this miss schlegel
p00576_A,00576,A,no i can t say i do
p00577_A,00577,A,well that was how it happened you see
p00578_A,00578,A,where did we meet mr bast for the minute i don t remember
p00579_A,00579,A,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p00580_A,00580,A,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p00581_A,00581,A,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p00582_A,00582,A,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p00583_A,00583,A,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p00584_A,00584,A,yes thank you miss schlegel
p00585_A,00585,A,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p00586_A,00586,A,yes the mistake arose it was a mistake
p00587_A,00587,A,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p00588_A,00588,A,that s so calling too a mistake
p00589_A,00589,A,then why
p00590_A,00590,A,i said to my wife i said to mrs bast and mrs bast said to me while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you
p00591_A,00591,A,no inconvenience but i still don t understand i still don t understand when did you say you paid this call
p00592_A,00592,A,call what call
p00593_A,00593,A,this afternoon call
p00594_A,00594,A,in the afternoon of course
p00595_A,00595,A,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00596_A,00596,A,s saturday
p00597_A,00597,A,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00598_A,00598,A,i don t call that fair i know what you mean and it isn t so
p00599_A,00599,A,oh don t let us mind
p00600_A,00600,A,it was something else i was somewhere else to what you think so there
p00601_A,00601,A,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p00602_A,00602,A,yes but i want i wanted have you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel it s a beautiful book i wanted to get back to the earth don t you see like richard does in the end or have you ever read stevenson s prince otto that s another beautiful book you get back to the earth in that i wanted i walked all the saturday night i walked
p00603_A,00603,A,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p00604_A,00604,A,oh i walked
p00605_A,00605,A,how far
p00606_A,00606,A,i don t know nor for how long it got too dark to see my watch
p00607_A,00607,A,were you walking alone may i ask
p00608_A,00608,A,yes but we d been talking it over at the office there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed
p00609_A,00609,A,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p00610_A,00610,A,well i lost it entirely first of all the street lamps then the trees and towards morning it got cloudy
p00611_A,00611,A,where did you start from do tell us more
p00612_A,00612,A,i took the underground to wimbledon as i came out of the office i said to myself i must have a walk once in a way if i don t take this walk now i shall never take it i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon and then
p00613_A,00613,A,but not good country there is it
p00614_A,00614,A,it was gas lamps for hours still i had all the night and being out was the great thing i did get into woods too presently
p00615_A,00615,A,yes go on
p00616_A,00616,A,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark
p00617_A,00617,A,did you actually go off the roads
p00618_A,00618,A,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p00619_A,00619,A,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00620_A,00620,A,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on
p00621_A,00621,A,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p00622_A,00622,A,yes but the wood this ere wood how did you get out of it
p00623_A,00623,A,i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood that was awful with gorse bushes i did wish i d never come but suddenly it got light just while i seemed going under one tree then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london
p00624_A,00624,A,but was the dawn wonderful
p00625_A,00625,A,no the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention
p00626_A,00626,A,just a grey evening turned upside down i know
p00627_A,00627,A,and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too i m glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say and besides you can believe me or not as you choose i was very hungry that dinner at wimbledon i meant it to last me all night like other dinners i never thought that walking would make such a difference why when you re walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines lord i did feel bad looking back it wasn t what you may call enjoyment it was more a case of sticking to it i did stick i i was determined oh hang it all what s the good i mean the good of living in a room for ever there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside if it s only nothing particular after all
p00628_A,00628,A,i should just think you ought
p00629_A,00629,A,curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies
p00630_A,00630,A,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p00631_A,00631,A,then you don t think i was foolish
p00632_A,00632,A,heavens no
p00633_A,00633,A,heaven help us if we do
p00634_A,00634,A,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00635_A,00635,A,no it wasn t foolish you ve pushed back the boundaries i think it splendid of you
p00636_A,00636,A,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p00637_A,00637,A,though we have walked too
p00638_A,00638,A,i must show you a picture upstairs
p00639_A,00639,A,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p00640_A,00640,A,yes you must do
p00641_A,00641,A,no i shall not it s better like this
p00642_A,00642,A,why better
p00643_A,00643,A,no it is better not to risk a second interview i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life really i mean this we can never repeat it has done me real good and there we had better leave it
p00644_A,00644,A,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p00645_A,00645,A,things so often get spoiled
p00646_A,00646,A,what s that card eh
p00647_A,00647,A,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p00648_A,00648,A,len who s miss schlegel
p00649_A,00649,A,well i know where you ve been but you don t know where i ve been
p00650_A,00650,A,order order miss schlegel you are here i understand to advise me in the interests of the society for the preservation of places of historic interest or natural beauty i cannot have you speaking out of your role it makes my poor head go round and i think you forget that i am very ill
p00651_A,00651,A,your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument why not give him the money itself you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year
p00652_A,00652,A,have i i thought i had a million
p00653_A,00653,A,wasn t a million your capital dear me we ought to have settled that still it doesn t matter whatever you ve got i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each
p00654_A,00654,A,but that would be pauperising them
p00655_A,00655,A,not if you gave them so much a big windfall would not pauperise a man it is these little driblets distributed among too many that do the harm money s educational it s far more educational than the things it buys in a sense well isn t the most civilized thing going the man who has learnt to wear his income properly give them a chance give them money don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies give them the wherewithal to buy these things when your socialism comes it may be different and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash till it comes give people cash for it is the warp of civilisation whatever the woof may be the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly for it s the the second most important thing in the world it is so slurred over and hushed up there is so little clear thinking oh political economy of course but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means money give mr bast money and don t bother about his ideals he ll pick up those for himself nothing but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world
p00656_A,00656,A,doesn t matter
p00657_A,00657,A,are we really going to follow up mr bast
p00658_A,00658,A,i don t know
p00659_A,00659,A,i think we won t
p00660_A,00660,A,as you like
p00661_A,00661,A,it s no good i think unless you really mean to know people the discussion brought that home to me we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse we mustn t play at friendship no it s no good
p00662_A,00662,A,there s mrs lanoline too so dull
p00663_A,00663,A,just so and possibly worse than dull
p00664_A,00664,A,i should like to know how he got hold of your card
p00665_A,00665,A,but he said something about a concert and an umbrella
p00666_A,00666,A,then did the card see the wife
p00667_A,00667,A,helen come to bed
p00668_A,00668,A,then what s the woof
p00669_A,00669,A,very much what one chooses it s something that isn t money one can t say more
p00670_A,00670,A,for tibby oxford
p00671_A,00671,A,it seems so
p00672_A,00672,A,for you
p00673_A,00673,A,now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it s that for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people
p00674_A,00674,A,why meg they re so much nicer generally i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it
p00675_A,00675,A,how do you do i thought i recognised your voices whatever are you both doing down here
p00676_A,00676,A,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son
p00677_A,00677,A,i beg your pardon
p00678_A,00678,A,isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible
p00679_A,00679,A,some one s got to go england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices unless we get firm in west africa ger untold complications may follow now tell me all your news
p00680_A,00680,A,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p00681_A,00681,A,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p00682_A,00682,A,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00683_A,00683,A,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p00684_A,00684,A,yes quickness in argument time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t oh i believe in these discussions oh yes it doesn t much matter what subject you take
p00685_A,00685,A,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
p00686_A,00686,A,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p00687_A,00687,A,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p00688_A,00688,A,but mr wilcox do first light another cigarette it s this we ve just come across a young fellow who s evidently very poor and who seems interest
p00689_A,00689,A,what in
p00690_A,00690,A,do you remember margaret
p00691_A,00691,A,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00692_A,00692,A,oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chance but he is so poor he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink well he got mixed up in our debate he wasn t the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man how should he be helped should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret s plan most of them thought this would pauperise him should he and those like him be given free libraries i said no he doesn t want more books to read but to read books rightly my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too nothing seemed quite right now what do you think imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor what would you do
p00693_A,00693,A,this is between friends it ll be in the receiver s hands before christmas it ll smash
p00694_A,00694,A,dear me helen listen to that and he ll have to get another place
p00695_A,00695,A,will have let him leave the ship before it sinks let him get one now
p00696_A,00696,A,why s that
p00697_A,00697,A,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p00698_A,00698,A,i hadn t thought of that
p00699_A,00699,A,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00700_A,00700,A,and how does he clean the boots
p00701_A,00701,A,not well
p00702_A,00702,A,there you are
p00703_A,00703,A,then do you really advise us to tell this youth
p00704_A,00704,A,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p00705_A,00705,A,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p00706_A,00706,A,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p00707_A,00707,A,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p00708_A,00708,A,human nature i suppose
p00709_A,00709,A,yes extremely
p00710_A,00710,A,and how s howards end looking
p00711_A,00711,A,it s let
p00712_A,00712,A,really and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea how strange are the ways of fate
p00713_A,00713,A,no it s let unfurnished we ve moved
p00714_A,00714,A,why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever evie never told me
p00715_A,00715,A,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled we only moved a week ago paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small endless drawbacks i forget whether you ve been up to it
p00716_A,00716,A,as far as the house never
p00717_A,00717,A,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales
p00718_A,00718,A,what a change i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you
p00719_A,00719,A,hilton isn t without us charles is there still
p00720_A,00720,A,still but i thought he was still at epsom they were furnishing that christmas one christmas how everything alters i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often wasn t it epsom
p00721_A,00721,A,yes but they moved eighteen months ago charles the good chap thought i should be lonely i didn t want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills he had a motor too there they all are a very jolly party he and she and the two grandchildren
p00722_A,00722,A,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family
p00723_A,00723,A,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to
p00724_A,00724,A,no but none of you are there
p00725_A,00725,A,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other
p00726_A,00726,A,and some people are lucky enough to have both you re doing yourself proud mr wilcox my congratulations
p00727_A,00727,A,and mine
p00728_A,00728,A,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either
p00729_A,00729,A,you too on the move
p00730_A,00730,A,next september
p00731_A,00731,A,every one moving good bye
p00732_A,00732,A,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p00733_A,00733,A,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all
p00734_A,00734,A,the more a lady has to say the better
p00735_A,00735,A,oh yes
p00736_A,00736,A,ladies brighten
p00737_A,00737,A,yes i know the darlings are regular sunbeams let me give you a plate
p00738_A,00738,A,how do you like your work
p00739_A,00739,A,oh well enough
p00740_A,00740,A,your company is the porphyrion isn t it
p00741_A,00741,A,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p00742_A,00742,A,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00743_A,00743,A,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p00744_A,00744,A,it depends on what you call big
p00745_A,00745,A,i mean by big a solid well established concern that offers a reasonably good career to its employes
p00746_A,00746,A,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p00747_A,00747,A,i quite agree and that s why i was curious to know is it a solid well established concern
p00748_A,00748,A,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00749_A,00749,A,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured
p00750_A,00750,A,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p00751_A,00751,A,oh good
p00752_A,00752,A,wrong so to speak
p00753_A,00753,A,how so to speak
p00754_A,00754,A,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p00755_A,00755,A,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p00756_A,00756,A,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00757_A,00757,A,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00758_A,00758,A,so you like carlyle
p00759_A,00759,A,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00760_A,00760,A,we brought the little fellows round

p00769_A,00769,A,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p00770_A,00770,A,i call that a very rude remark what do you want to turn on me like that for
p00771_A,00771,A,what do you want to have me here for
p00772_A,00772,A,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p00773_A,00773,A,i don t want your patronage i don t want your tea i was quite happy what do you want to unsettle me for i put it to this gentleman i ask you sir am i to have my brain picked
p00774_A,00774,A,are we intruding miss schlegel can we be of any use or shall we go
p00775_A,00775,A,i m connected with a leading insurance company sir i receive what i take to be an invitation from these ladies i come and it s to have my brain picked i ask you is it fair
p00776_A,00776,A,highly unfair
p00777_A,00777,A,there you hear that most unfair the gentleman says there not content with you can t deny it but as soon as i m useful it s a very different thing oh yes send for him cross question him pick his brains oh yes now take me on the whole i m a quiet fellow i m law abiding i don t wish any unpleasantness but i i
p00778_A,00778,A,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p00779_A,00779,A,i fail to see the connection
p00780_A,00780,A,so do i you were that last sunday you are this to day mr bast i and my sister have talked you over we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us we did not have you here out of charity which bores us but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives they have never entered into mine but into yours we thought haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some place some beloved place or tree we thought you one of these
p00781_A,00781,A,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p00782_A,00782,A,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p00783_A,00783,A,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p00784_A,00784,A,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p00785_A,00785,A,oh yes
p00786_A,00786,A,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p00787_A,00787,A,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p00788_A,00788,A,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p00789_A,00789,A,oh i didn t mind oughtn t you really to be more careful
p00790_A,00790,A,this is the young man whom we were to warn against the porphyrion we warn him and look
p00791_A,00791,A,i hardly consider that a fair deduction
p00792_A,00792,A,obviously unfair i was only thinking how tangled things are it s our fault mostly neither yours nor his
p00793_A,00793,A,miss schlegel you are too kind
p00794_A,00794,A,yes indeed
p00795_A,00795,A,you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly you must keep that type at a distance otherwise they forget themselves sad but true they aren t our sort and one must face the fact
p00796_A,00796,A,ye es
p00797_A,00797,A,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman
p00798_A,00798,A,i admit it willingly a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself
p00799_A,00799,A,what did he suspect you of
p00800_A,00800,A,of wanting to make money out of him
p00801_A,00801,A,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit
p00802_A,00802,A,exactly how indeed just horrible corroding suspicion one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes
p00803_A,00803,A,i come back to my original point you ought to be more careful miss schlegel your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in
p00804_A,00804,A,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again
p00805_A,00805,A,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him
p00806_A,00806,A,i do firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out secondly he cares for something special in adventure it is quickest to call that special something poetry
p00807_A,00807,A,oh he s one of that writer sort
p00808_A,00808,A,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both
p00809_A,00809,A,one minute you know nothing about him he probably has his own joys and interests wife children snug little home that s where we practical fellows are more tolerant than you intellectuals we live and let live and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs i quite grant i look at the faces of the clerks in my own office and observe them to be dull but i don t know what s going on beneath so by the way with london i have heard you rail against london miss schlegel and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you what do you know about london you only see civilisation from the outside i don t say in your case but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity discontent and socialism
p00810_A,00810,A,his wife is an old bore he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us
p00811_A,00811,A,with you
p00812_A,00812,A,yes he hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed he needs outside interests
p00813_A,00813,A,naughty young man
p00814_A,00814,A,naughty when you re married miss wilcox won t you want outside interests
p00815_A,00815,A,he has apparently got them
p00816_A,00816,A,yes indeed father
p00817_A,00817,A,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that
p00818_A,00818,A,oh i dare say
p00819_A,00819,A,miss wilcox he was
p00820_A,00820,A,m m m m
p00821_A,00821,A,he said so and about such a thing he wouldn t lie that s where i differ from you men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort
p00822_A,00822,A,miss schlegel excuse me but i know the type
p00823_A,00823,A,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man
p00824_A,00824,A,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say
p00825_A,00825,A,i forget
p00826_A,00826,A,surely he has some opinion
p00827_A,00827,A,he laughs if i remember correctly
p00828_A,00828,A,he s very clever isn t he
p00829_A,00829,A,yes pretty well but i wonder what helen s doing
p00830_A,00830,A,you in there
p00831_A,00831,A,yes he s gone some time
p00832_A,00832,A,why you re all alone
p00833_A,00833,A,yes it s all right meg poor poor creature
p00834_A,00834,A,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later mr w much concerned and slightly titillated
p00835_A,00835,A,oh i ve no patience with him i hate him poor dear mr bast he wanted to talk literature and we would talk business such a muddle of a man and yet so worth pulling through i like him extraordinarily
p00836_A,00836,A,well done but come into the drawing room now and don t talk about him to the wilcoxes make light of the whole thing
p00837_A,00837,A,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p00838_A,00838,A,i am really concerned at the way those girls go on they are as clever as you make em but unpractical god bless me one of these days they ll go too far girls like that oughtn t to live alone in london until they marry they ought to have some one to look after them we must look in more often we re better than no one you like them don t you evie
p00839_A,00839,A,i thought i d get round if i could evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table always secure a table first evie don t pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don t miss schlegel come in my side out of pity my goodness but you look tired been worrying round after your young clerks
p00840_A,00840,A,no after houses i m hungry not tired i want to eat heaps
p00841_A,00841,A,that s good what ll you have
p00842_A,00842,A,fish pie
p00843_A,00843,A,fish pie fancy coming for fish pie to simpson s it s not a bit the thing to go for here
p00844_A,00844,A,go for something for me then
p00845_A,00845,A,it s a golden rule to tip the carver tip everywhere s my motto
p00846_A,00846,A,perhaps it does make life more human
p00847_A,00847,A,then the fellows know one again especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year s end to year s end
p00848_A,00848,A,have you been in the east
p00849_A,00849,A,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately
p00850_A,00850,A,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses
p00851_A,00851,A,afraid i don t
p00852_A,00852,A,well what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them
p00853_A,00853,A,evie i like that miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
p00854_A,00854,A,what s that father
p00855_A,00855,A,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p00856_A,00856,A,percy do you know of anything
p00857_A,00857,A,i can t say i do
p00858_A,00858,A,how like you you re never any good
p00859_A,00859,A,never any good just listen to her never any good oh come
p00860_A,00860,A,well you aren t miss schlegel is he
p00861_A,00861,A,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s
p00862_A,00862,A,with pleasure
p00863_A,00863,A,no you d hate it it s all proteids and body buildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura
p00864_A,00864,A,a what
p00865_A,00865,A,never heard of an aura oh happy happy man i scrub at mine for hours nor of an astral plane just so luckily it was helen s aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went
p00866_A,00866,A,funny experiences seem to come to you two girls no one s ever asked me about my what d ye call it perhaps i ve not got one
p00867_A,00867,A,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it
p00868_A,00868,A,tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that
p00869_A,00869,A,too difficult a question
p00870_A,00870,A,why s that gruyere or stilton
p00871_A,00871,A,gruyere please
p00872_A,00872,A,better have stilton
p00873_A,00873,A,stilton because though i don t believe in auras and think theosophy s only a halfway house
p00874_A,00874,A,yet there may be something in it all the same
p00875_A,00875,A,not even that it may be halfway in the wrong direction i can t explain i don t believe in all these fads and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them
p00876_A,00876,A,so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it
p00877_A,00877,A,i could indeed i will when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny but why do you want this settled
p00878_A,00878,A,i don t know
p00879_A,00879,A,now mr wilcox you do know how s your house
p00880_A,00880,A,much the same as when you honoured it last week
p00881_A,00881,A,i don t mean ducie street howards end of course
p00882_A,00882,A,why of course
p00883_A,00883,A,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us we re nearly demented
p00884_A,00884,A,let me think i wish i could help you but i thought you wanted to be in town one bit of advice fix your district then fix your price and then don t budge that s how i got both ducie street and oniton i said to myself i mean to be exactly here and i was and oniton s a place in a thousand
p00885_A,00885,A,but i do budge gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses cow them with an eye and up they come trembling ladies can t it s the houses that are mesmerising me i ve no control over the saucy things houses are alive no
p00886_A,00886,A,i m out of my depth didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy
p00887_A,00887,A,did i i mean i did more or less i talk the same way to every one or try to
p00888_A,00888,A,yes i know and how much of it do you suppose he understood
p00889_A,00889,A,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice
p00890_A,00890,A,lower classes well you do admit that there are rich and poor that s something you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same the hard working man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom
p00891_A,00891,A,every one admits that
p00892_A,00892,A,your socialists don t
p00893_A,00893,A,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily
p00894_A,00894,A,you needn t go though
p00895_A,00895,A,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p00896_A,00896,A,no we have no real ties
p00897_A,00897,A,shan t i go up to town to day take the house if it s the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow and start enjoying myself i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind
p00898_A,00898,A,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00899_A,00899,A,there s nothing rash to do
p00900_A,00900,A,who are the wilcoxes
p00901_A,00901,A,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00902_A,00902,A,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p00903_A,00903,A,interesting people don t get one houses
p00904_A,00904,A,meg if you start in your honest english vein i shall throw the treacle at you
p00905_A,00905,A,it s a better vein than the cosmopolitan now children which is it to be you know the ducie street house shall i say yes or shall i say no tibby love which i m specially anxious to pin you both it depends on nothing of the sort say yes i think that our race is degenerating we cannot settle even this little thing what will it be like when we have to settle a big one
p00906_A,00906,A,it will be as easy as eating
p00907_A,00907,A,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p00908_A,00908,A,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p00909_A,00909,A,i knew it i told you so it is the little things one bungles at the big real ones are nothing when they come
p00910_A,00910,A,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p00911_A,00911,A,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p00912_A,00912,A,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00913_A,00913,A,helen may be right
p00914_A,00914,A,of course she s right
p00915_A,00915,A,this is awfully kind of you but i m afraid it s not going to do the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family
p00916_A,00916,A,what have you come up determined not to deal
p00917_A,00917,A,not exactly
p00918_A,00918,A,not exactly in that case let s be starting
p00919_A,00919,A,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane
p00920_A,00920,A,come let s be starting how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane
p00921_A,00921,A,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things
p00922_A,00922,A,evie you won t see her she s gone out with cahill it s no fun i can tell you being left so much alone i ve got my work all day indeed a great deal too much of it but when i come home in the evening i tell you i can t stand the house
p00923_A,00923,A,in my absurd way i m lonely too it s heart breaking to leave one s old home i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there helen says
p00924_A,00924,A,you too feel lonely
p00925_A,00925,A,horribly hullo parliament s back
p00926_A,00926,A,yes they are talking again but you were going to say
p00927_A,00927,A,only some rubbish about furniture helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas just imagine it rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them
p00928_A,00928,A,your sister always likes her little joke
p00929_A,00929,A,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you
p00930_A,00930,A,you are not as unpractical as you pretend i shall never believe it at all events you responded to my telegram promptly
p00931_A,00931,A,oh even i know a good thing when i see it
p00932_A,00932,A,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world
p00933_A,00933,A,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that
p00934_A,00934,A,i am glad very glad there is so much cant talked in would be intellectual circles i am glad you don t share it self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character but i can t stand those people who run down comforts they have usually some axe to grind can you
p00935_A,00935,A,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends
p00936_A,00936,A,i mean reasonable comforts of course i shouldn t like to think that you
p00937_A,00937,A,i want to go over the whole house as soon as i get back to swanage which will be to morrow afternoon i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby and wire you yes or no
p00938_A,00938,A,right the dining room now the entrance hall here we fellows smoke
p00939_A,00939,A,oh jolly
p00940_A,00940,A,you do like it it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable isn t it
p00941_A,00941,A,ye es semi rubbish are those cruikshanks
p00942_A,00942,A,gillrays shall we go on upstairs
p00943_A,00943,A,does all this furniture come from howards end
p00944_A,00944,A,the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton
p00945_A,00945,A,does however i m concerned with the house not the furniture how big is this smoking room
p00946_A,00946,A,thirty by fifteen no wait a minute fifteen and a half
p00947_A,00947,A,ah well mr wilcox aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses
p00948_A,00948,A,miss schlegel i have had you up on false pretences i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house could you be induced to share my is it probable
p00949_A,00949,A,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may
p00950_A,00950,A,miss schlegel margaret you don t understand

p00960_A,00960,A,and your english lakes vindermere grasmere they then unhealthy
p00961_A,00961,A,no frau liesecke but that is because they are fresh water and different salt water ought to have tides and go up and down a great deal or else it smells look for instance at an aquarium
p00962_A,00962,A,an aquarium oh meesis munt you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt why then victor my brother in law collected many tadpoles
p00963_A,00963,A,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00964_A,00964,A,then smell and the mud of your pool down there does it not smell or may i say stink ha ha
p00965_A,00965,A,there always has been mud in poole harbour the rivers bring it down and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it
p00966_A,00966,A,yes that is so
p00967_A,00967,A,bournemouth is bournemouth is poole was and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three now frau liesecke i have shown you bournemouth and i have shown you poole so let us walk backward a little and look down again at swanage
p00968_A,00968,A,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train
p00969_A,00969,A,oh dearest margaret i do hope she won t be overtired
p00970_A,00970,A,oh i do wonder i do wonder whether she s taken the house
p00971_A,00971,A,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p00972_A,00972,A,so do i oh so do i
p00973_A,00973,A,will it be as beautiful as wickham place
p00974_A,00974,A,you ve never seen miss wilcox frieda how absurdly matrimonial you are
p00975_A,00975,A,and to that charles oh helen helen what a time that was
p00976_A,00976,A,meg and i haven t got such tender hearts if there s a chance of a cheap house we go for it
p00977_A,00977,A,now look frau liesecke at my niece s train you see it is coming towards us coming coming and when it gets to corfe it will actually go through the downs on which we are standing so that if we walk over as i suggested and look down on swanage we shall see it coming on the other side shall we
p00978_A,00978,A,you see the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles they have one ducie street two howards end where my great rumpus was three a country seat in shropshire four charles has a house in hilton and five another near epsom and six evie will have a house when she marries and probably a pied a terre in the country which makes seven oh yes and paul a hut in africa makes eight i wish we could get howards end that was something like a dear little house didn t you think so aunt juley
p00979_A,00979,A,i had too much to do dear to look at it i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides it isn t likely i should remember much i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
p00980_A,00980,A,yes so do i but oh dear dear how dreadful it all seems and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement you and frieda and meg and mrs wilcox all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul
p00981_A,00981,A,you yet may
p00982_A,00982,A,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that
p00983_A,00983,A,one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions
p00984_A,00984,A,look stand where i stand and you will see the pony cart coming i see the pony cart coming
p00985_A,00985,A,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p00986_A,00986,A,not exactly
p00987_A,00987,A,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00988_A,00988,A,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you
p00989_A,00989,A,wait one minute
p00990_A,00990,A,tibby hurry up through i can t hold this gate indefinitely aunt juley i say aunt juley make the tea will you and frieda we ve got to talk houses and will come on afterwards
p00991_A,00991,A,oh really
p00992_A,00992,A,don t don t don t meg don t don t don t do such a thing i tell you not to don t i know don t
p00993_A,00993,A,what do you know
p00994_A,00994,A,panic and emptiness don t
p00995_A,00995,A,but we would still see each other very often and you
p00996_A,00996,A,it s not a thing like that
p00997_A,00997,A,what s happened to you
p00998_A,00998,A,but it s stupid
p00999_A,00999,A,i don t know what s happened to either of us we must both have gone mad look here sit down
p01000_A,01000,A,all right i ll sit down if you ll sit down
p01001_A,01001,A,there now whatever whatever is the matter
p01002_A,01002,A,i do mean what i said don t it wouldn t do
p01003_A,01003,A,oh helen stop saying don t it s ignorant it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime don t is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr bast well
p01004_A,01004,A,tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime
p01005_A,01005,A,that s better well where shall i begin when i arrived at waterloo no i ll go back before that because i m anxious you should know everything from the first the first was about ten days ago it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can t help any more than we can you know at least i know in my own case when a man has said to me so and so s a pretty girl i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so and long to tweak her ear it s a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it but it wasn t only this in mr wilcox s case i gather now
p01006_A,01006,A,then you love him
p01007_A,01007,A,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years
p01008_A,01008,A,but you will
p01009_A,01009,A,yes of that i m pretty sure indeed i began the moment he spoke to me
p01010_A,01010,A,and have settled to marry him
p01011_A,01011,A,i had but am wanting a long talk about it now what is it against him helen you must try and say
p01012_A,01012,A,it is ever since paul
p01013_A,01013,A,but what has mr wilcox to do with paul
p01014_A,01014,A,but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger
p01015_A,01015,A,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you
p01016_A,01016,A,no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad
p01017_A,01017,A,i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me
p01018_A,01018,A,and to me and to all women so one kissed paul
p01019_A,01019,A,that s brutal mine is an absolutely different case i ve thought things out
p01020_A,01020,A,one would lose something
p01021_A,01021,A,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago
p01022_A,01022,A,yes and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme ah well
p01023_A,01023,A,i little thought then certainly did you
p01024_A,01024,A,i don t know about that i shouldn t like to say
p01025_A,01025,A,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal
p01026_A,01026,A,by the way
p01027_A,01027,A,a suggestion a seed
p01028_A,01028,A,i was thinking if you didn t mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle
p01029_A,01029,A,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby
p01030_A,01030,A,with your brother
p01031_A,01031,A,yes during cigarettes
p01032_A,01032,A,oh very well
p01033_A,01033,A,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably
p01034_A,01034,A,about greece too
p01035_A,01035,A,greece was a very good card henry tibby s only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little well done
p01036_A,01036,A,i was telling him i have shares in a currant farm near calamata
p01037_A,01037,A,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon
p01038_A,01038,A,what to do
p01039_A,01039,A,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery
p01040_A,01040,A,moderately but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady
p01041_A,01041,A,why not
p01042_A,01042,A,no hotels
p01043_A,01043,A,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs
p01044_A,01044,A,i wasn t aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again
p01045_A,01045,A,do before you go i am so anxious you two should be friends
p01046_A,01046,A,your sister and i have always hit it off but we re drifting away from our business let me begin at the beginning you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill
p01047_A,01047,A,dolly s uncle
p01048_A,01048,A,exactly the girl s madly in love with him a very good sort of fellow but he demands and rightly a suitable provision with her and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development
p01049_A,01049,A,poor fellow
p01050_A,01050,A,charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others
p01051_A,01051,A,of course not you mean money how stupid i am of course not
p01052_A,01052,A,yes money since you put it so frankly i am determined to be just to all just to you just to them i am determined that my children shall have me
p01053_A,01053,A,be generous to them bother justice
p01054_A,01054,A,i am determined and have already written to charles to that effect
p01055_A,01055,A,how much have you a year i ve six hundred
p01056_A,01056,A,my income
p01057_A,01057,A,yes we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles justice and even generosity depend on that
p01058_A,01058,A,i must say you re a downright young woman what a question to spring on a fellow
p01059_A,01059,A,that s all right don t tell me i don t want to know i can do the sum just as well by proportion divide your income into ten parts how many parts would you give to evie how many to charles how many to paul
p01060_A,01060,A,the fact is my dear i hadn t any intention of bothering you with details i only wanted to let you know that well that something must be done for the others and you ve understood me perfectly so let s pass on to the next point
p01061_A,01061,A,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one
p01062_A,01062,A,we ve none too much i assure you you re marrying a poor man
p01063_A,01063,A,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world
p01064_A,01064,A,there s this other point and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters what s to be done now about the house in ducie street
p01065_A,01065,A,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me
p01066_A,01066,A,i say take care i don t report you to the police evie will probably be married in september we could scarcely think of anything before then
p01067_A,01067,A,the earlier the nicer henry females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer
p01068_A,01068,A,how about september for us too
p01069_A,01069,A,right shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it that s rather an idea they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management look here yes we ll do that and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire
p01070_A,01070,A,heavens how you women do fly round my head s in a whirl point by point margaret howards end s impossible i let it to hamar bryce on a three years agreement last march don t you remember oniton well that is much much too far away to rely on entirely you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount but we must have a house within easy reach of town only ducie street has huge drawbacks there s a mews behind yes in summer especially the mews is a serious nuisance the smoking room too is an abominable little den the house opposite has been taken by operatic people ducie street s going down it s my private opinion
p01071_A,01071,A,how sad it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses
p01072_A,01072,A,shows things are moving good for trade
p01073_A,01073,A,i hate this continual flux of london it is an epitome of us at our worst eternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming away streaming streaming for ever that s why i dread it so i mistrust rivers even in scenery now the sea
p01074_A,01074,A,high tide yes and these are the men to whom we give the vote however they have their own lives and interests let s get on a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone
p01075_A,01075,A,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment
p01076_A,01076,A,it isn t meant as a compliment my dear i just won t have you going about in the dark such people about too it s dangerous
p01077_A,01077,A,can t i look after myself i do wish
p01078_A,01078,A,you ve waked the baby i knew you would rum ti foo rackety tackety tompkin i m not responsible for what uncle percy does nor for anybody else or anything so there
p01079_A,01079,A,who asked him while i was away who asked my sister down to meet him who sent them out in the motor day after day
p01080_A,01080,A,charles that reminds me of some poem
p01081_A,01081,A,does it indeed we shall all be dancing to a very different music presently miss schlegel has fairly got us on toast
p01082_A,01082,A,i could simply scratch that woman s eyes out and to say it s my fault is most unfair
p01083_A,01083,A,it s your fault and five months ago you admitted it
p01084_A,01084,A,i didn t
p01085_A,01085,A,you did
p01086_A,01086,A,tootle tootle playing on the pootle
p01087_A,01087,A,it s all very well to turn the conversation but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable but you must needs start match making besides cahill s too old
p01088_A,01088,A,of course if you re going to be rude to uncle percy
p01089_A,01089,A,miss schlegel always meant to get hold of howards end and thanks to you she s got it
p01090_A,01090,A,i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair you couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting could he diddums
p01091_A,01091,A,my motto is concentrate i ve no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing
p01092_A,01092,A,it isn t frittering away the strength it s enlarging the space in which you may be strong
p01093_A,01093,A,you re a clever little woman but my motto s concentrate
p01094_A,01094,A,here we all are
p01095_A,01095,A,here we are good morning helen
p01096_A,01096,A,good morning mr wilcox
p01097_A,01097,A,henry she has had such a nice letter from the queer cross boy do you remember him he had a sad moustache but the back of his head was young
p01098_A,01098,A,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you
p01099_A,01099,A,thanks to your hint he s clearing out of the porphyrion
p01100_A,01100,A,not a bad business that porphyrion
p01101_A,01101,A,not a bad surely on chelsea embankment
p01102_A,01102,A,here s our hostess good morning mrs munt fine rhododendrons good morning frau liesecke we manage to grow flowers in england don t we
p01103_A,01103,A,not a bad business
p01104_A,01104,A,when there is a sublet i find that damage
p01105_A,01105,A,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p01106_A,01106,A,a clerk who clears out of any concern good or bad without securing a berth somewhere else first is a fool and i ve no pity for him
p01107_A,01107,A,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right
p01108_A,01108,A,dempster why goodness me yes
p01109_A,01109,A,more right than the porphyrion
p01110_A,01110,A,yes yes yes safe as houses safer
p01111_A,01111,A,very many thanks i m sorry if you sublet
p01112_A,01112,A,if he sublets i shan t have the same control in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be things may be done for which no money can compensate for instance i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt it hangs margaret we must go and see the old place some time it s pretty in its way we ll motor down and have lunch with charles
p01113_A,01113,A,i should enjoy that
p01114_A,01114,A,what about next wednesday
p01115_A,01115,A,wednesday no i couldn t well do that aunt juley expects us to stop here another week at least
p01116_A,01116,A,but you can give that up now
p01117_A,01117,A,er no
p01118_A,01118,A,oh that ll be all right i ll speak to her
p01119_A,01119,A,this visit is a high solemnity my aunt counts on it year after year she turns the house upside down for us she invites our special friends she scarcely knows frieda and we can t leave her on her hands i missed one day and she would be so hurt if i didn t stay the full ten
p01120_A,01120,A,but i ll say a word to her don t you bother
p01121_A,01121,A,henry i won t go don t bully me
p01122_A,01122,A,you want to see the house though
p01123_A,01123,A,very much i ve heard so much about it one way or the other aren t there pigs teeth in the wych elm
p01124_A,01124,A,pigs teeth
p01125_A,01125,A,and you chew the bark for toothache
p01126_A,01126,A,what a rum notion of course not
p01127_A,01127,A,oh mr wilcox about the porphyrion
p01128_A,01128,A,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p01129_A,01129,A,but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad and would smash before christmas
p01130_A,01130,A,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p01131_A,01131,A,in other words mr bast need never have left it
p01132_A,01132,A,no the fellow needn t
p01133_A,01133,A,and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary
p01134_A,01134,A,he only says reduced
p01135_A,01135,A,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p01136_A,01136,A,what what s that do you mean that i m responsible
p01137_A,01137,A,you re ridiculous helen
p01138_A,01138,A,you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen
p01139_A,01139,A,is that your point a man who had little money has less that s mine
p01140_A,01140,A,i am grieved for your clerk but it is all in the day s work it s part of the battle of life
p01141_A,01141,A,a man who had little money has less owing to us under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression
p01142_A,01142,A,oh come come you re not to blame no one s to blame
p01143_A,01143,A,is no one to blame for anything
p01144_A,01144,A,i wouldn t say that but you re taking it far too seriously who is this fellow
p01145_A,01145,A,we have told you about the fellow twice already you have even met the fellow he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile he is capable of better things we we the upper classes thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge and here s the result
p01146_A,01146,A,now a word of advice
p01147_A,01147,A,i require no more advice
p01148_A,01148,A,a word of advice don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor see that she doesn t margaret the poor are poor and one s sorry for them but there it is as civilisation moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary it s just the shoe pinching no one can help it and it might easily have been worse by all means subscribe to charities subscribe to them largely but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social question except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be point me out a time when men have been equal
p01149_A,01149,A,i didn t say
p01150_A,01150,A,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier no no you can t there always have been rich and poor i m no fatalist heaven forbid but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces and there always will be rich and poor you can t deny it and you can t deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward
p01151_A,01151,A,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p01152_A,01152,A,don t ever discuss political economy with henry it ll only end in a cry
p01153_A,01153,A,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion i don t like those men they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow good it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr brits of today are in pain
p01154_A,01154,A,he is such a man in theory but oh helen in theory
p01155_A,01155,A,but oh meg what a theory
p01156_A,01156,A,why should you put things so bitterly dearie
p01157_A,01157,A,margaret magsy it isn t true surely what mr wilcox says that you want to go away early next week
p01158_A,01158,A,not want but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles s
p01159_A,01159,A,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down

p01167_A,01167,A,why did he go so suddenly
p01168_A,01168,A,invalid type couldn t sleep
p01169_A,01169,A,poor fellow
p01170_A,01170,A,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down
p01171_A,01171,A,yes i flung them down
p01172_A,01172,A,i ve sent a telegram after him and a pretty sharp one too he and he in person is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years
p01173_A,01173,A,the keys are at the farm we wouldn t have the keys
p01174_A,01174,A,quite right

p01183_A,01183,A,we are

p01187_A,01187,A,no i shall be back before i m gone
p01188_A,01188,A,oh well i took you for ruth wilcox
p01189_A,01189,A,i mrs wilcox i
p01190_A,01190,A,it gave her quite a turn none of you girls have any nerves really of course a word from me put it all right but silly old miss avery she frightened you didn t she margaret there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds she might have said something instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on i passed her as i came in enough to make the car shy i believe miss avery goes in for being a character some old maids do it is their last resource heaven knows what she was doing in the place but that s bryce s business not mine
p01191_A,01191,A,i wasn t as foolish as you suggest she only startled me for the house had been silent so long
p01192_A,01192,A,did you take her for a spook
p01193_A,01193,A,not exactly
p01194_A,01194,A,she really did frighten you poor margaret and very naturally uneducated classes are so stupid
p01195_A,01195,A,is miss avery uneducated classes
p01196_A,01196,A,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once
p01197_A,01197,A,i shouldn t have disliked it perhaps
p01198_A,01198,A,or miss avery giving me a wedding present but charles said i must try not to mind because she had known his grandmother
p01199_A,01199,A,as usual you ve got the story wrong my good dorothea
p01200_A,01200,A,i meant great grandmother the one who left mrs wilcox the house weren t both of them and miss avery friends when howards end too was a farm then hadn t mrs wilcox a brother or was it an uncle anyhow he popped the question and miss avery she said no just imagine if she d said yes she would have been charles s aunt oh i say that s rather good charlie s aunt i must chaff him about that this evening and the man went out and was killed yes i m certain i ve got it right now tom howard he was the last of them
p01201_A,01201,A,i believe so
p01202_A,01202,A,i say howards end howards ended i m rather on the spot this evening eh
p01203_A,01203,A,i wish you d ask whether crane s ended
p01204_A,01204,A,oh mr wilcox how can you
p01205_A,01205,A,it is so unlucky that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago then it had four five times the land thirty acres at least one could have made something out of it then a small park or at all events shrubberies and rebuilt the house farther away from the road what s the good of taking it in hand now nothing but the meadow left and even that was heavily mortgaged when i first had to do with things yes and the house too oh it was no joke mismanagement did it besides the days for small farms are over it doesn t pay except with intensive cultivation small holdings back to the land ah philanthropic bunkum take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale most of the land you see belongs to the people at the park they made their pile over copper good chaps avery s farm sishe s what they call the common where you see that ruined oak one after the other fell in and so did this as near as is no matter when i had more control i did what i could sold off the two and a half animals and the mangy pony and the superannuated tools pulled down the outhouses drained thinned out i don t know how many guelder roses and elder trees and inside the house i turned the old kitchen into a hall and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was garage and so on came later but one could still tell it s been an old farm and yet it isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew extraordinary who told you
p01206_A,01206,A,but i never dreamt of such a thing dad took me to call now and then and made me ask her to simpson s well i m altogether off dad
p01207_A,01207,A,for god s sake hurry the women up we shall never be off
p01208_A,01208,A,they threaten to cut the painter and where shall we be then miss schlegel you ll undertake to keep henry sound about tariff reform it is our last hope
p01209_A,01209,A,i m sorry do you mind getting out by the door on the right steady on

p01217_A,01217,A,i want to go back though i say the men can t see to it oh this is ridiculous charles i ask you to stop

p01240_A,01240,A,miss wilcox is up
p01241_A,01241,A,what is that i can t hear
p01242_A,01242,A,i was afraid something had gone wrong
p01243_A,01243,A,no i have nothing to say but you may talk if there is this nasty curve couldn t we walk to the church not of course you and evie but the rest of us might very well go on first and that would mean fewer carriages
p01244_A,01244,A,one can t have ladies walking through the market square the fussells wouldn t like it they were awfully particular at charles s wedding my she our party was anxious to walk and certainly the church was just round the corner and i shouldn t have minded but the colonel made a great point of it
p01245_A,01245,A,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous
p01246_A,01246,A,by your leave let me pass please
p01247_A,01247,A,we shall never get through it i think it did go off well since i had to jump out of the motor i m thankful i lighted on my left hand i am so very glad about it henry dear i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable you must all remember that we have no practical person among us except my aunt and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale
p01248_A,01248,A,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p01249_A,01249,A,my old home s falling into pieces henry i only want my new isn t it a perfect evening
p01250_A,01250,A,the alexandrina isn t bad
p01251_A,01251,A,the alexandrina
p01252_A,01252,A,it s off curzon street
p01253_A,01253,A,is it let s be married from off curzon street who are those people
p01254_A,01254,A,they re callers it s too late for callers
p01255_A,01255,A,perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents
p01256_A,01256,A,i m not at home yet to townees
p01257_A,01257,A,what is it oh what s wrong is tibby ill
p01258_A,01258,A,they re starving i found them starving
p01259_A,01259,A,who why have you come
p01260_A,01260,A,the basts
p01261_A,01261,A,oh helen whatever have you done now
p01262_A,01262,A,he has lost his place he has been turned out of his bank yes he s done for we upper classes have ruined him and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life starving his wife is ill starving she fainted in the train
p01263_A,01263,A,helen are you mad
p01264_A,01264,A,perhaps yes if you like i m mad but i ve brought them i ll stand injustice no longer i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves
p01265_A,01265,A,have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire helen
p01266_A,01266,A,there was a restaurant car on the train
p01267_A,01267,A,don t be absurd they aren t starving and you know it now begin from the beginning i won t have such theatrical nonsense how dare you yes how dare you bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way my goodness but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy look servants people out of the windows they think it s some vulgar scandal and i must explain oh no it s only my sister screaming and only two hangers on of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason
p01268_A,01268,A,kindly take back that word hangers on
p01269_A,01269,A,very well i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you ve brought them here or why you re here yourself
p01270_A,01270,A,it s our last chance of seeing mr wilcox he s going to scotland i know he is i insist on seeing him
p01271_A,01271,A,yes to morrow
p01272_A,01272,A,i knew it was our last chance
p01273_A,01273,A,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p01274_A,01274,A,you have fainted perhaps the air will do you good
p01275_A,01275,A,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p01276_A,01276,A,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p01277_A,01277,A,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p01278_A,01278,A,that s right
p01279_A,01279,A,and went into a bank instead
p01280_A,01280,A,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p01281_A,01281,A,i hate all this
p01282_A,01282,A,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
p01283_A,01283,A,i brought them i did it all
p01284_A,01284,A,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p01285_A,01285,A,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all
p01286_A,01286,A,it s work he wants can t you see
p01287_A,01287,A,jacky let s go we re more bother than we re worth we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us and they never will there s nothing we re good enough to do
p01288_A,01288,A,we would like to find you work we want to i like my sister you re only down in your luck go to the hotel have a good night s rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
p01289_A,01289,A,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p01290_A,01290,A,helen i like mr bast i agree that he s worth helping i agree that we are directly responsible
p01291_A,01291,A,no indirectly via mr wilcox
p01292_A,01292,A,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i ll do nothing no doubt you re right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry only i won t have it so choose if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them in my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice i have no use for justice if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves but he wants work and that we can t give him but possibly henry can
p01293_A,01293,A,it s his duty to
p01294_A,01294,A,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better
p01295_A,01295,A,very well i promise you take it very calmly
p01296_A,01296,A,was it townees
p01297_A,01297,A,you ll never believe me it s all right now but it was my sister
p01298_A,01298,A,helen here but she refused the invitation i thought hated weddings
p01299_A,01299,A,don t get up she has not come to the wedding i ve bundled her off to the george no she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them
p01300_A,01300,A,let em all come
p01301_A,01301,A,my dear henry did you see them
p01302_A,01302,A,i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman certainly
p01303_A,01303,A,the brown bunch was helen but did you catch sight of a sea green and salmon bunch
p01304_A,01304,A,what are they out bean feasting
p01305_A,01305,A,no business they wanted to see me and later on i want to talk to you about them
p01306_A,01306,A,why later on tell me now no time like the present
p01307_A,01307,A,shall i
p01308_A,01308,A,if it isn t a long story
p01309_A,01309,A,oh not five minutes but there s a sting at the end of it for i want you to find the man some work in your office
p01310_A,01310,A,what are his qualifications
p01311_A,01311,A,i don t know he s a clerk
p01312_A,01312,A,how old
p01313_A,01313,A,twenty five perhaps
p01314_A,01314,A,where was he before
p01315_A,01315,A,dempster s bank
p01316_A,01316,A,why did he leave
p01317_A,01317,A,they reduced their staff
p01318_A,01318,A,the woman who can t influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself
p01319_A,01319,A,i should be glad if you took him but i don t know whether he s qualified
p01320_A,01320,A,i ll do what i can but margaret this mustn t be taken as a precedent
p01321_A,01321,A,no of course of course
p01322_A,01322,A,i can t fit in your proteges every day business would suffer
p01323_A,01323,A,i can promise you he s the last he he s rather a special case
p01324_A,01324,A,proteges always are your protege has made us late the fussells will just be starting
p01325_A,01325,A,she s overtired
p01326_A,01326,A,she s something else this won t do i can t have her in my garden in this state

p01342_A,01342,A,don t you indeed i do allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan
p01343_A,01343,A,this is helen s plan not mine
p01344_A,01344,A,i now understand your interest in the basts very well thought out i am amused at your caution margaret you are quite right it was necessary i am a man and have lived a man s past i have the honour to release you from your engagement
p01345_A,01345,A,so what
p01346_A,01346,A,no let me do that
p01347_A,01347,A,thanks so much you see he has forgiven me
p01348_A,01348,A,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p01349_A,01349,A,so that woman has been your mistress
p01350_A,01350,A,you put it with your usual delicacy
p01351_A,01351,A,when please
p01352_A,01352,A,mr wilcox is so illogical if we told him it was his duty to take you on he might refuse to do it the fact is he isn t properly educated i don t want to set you against him but you ll find him a trial
p01353_A,01353,A,i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel
p01354_A,01354,A,i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that
p01355_A,01355,A,i get no time for reading
p01356_A,01356,A,had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life
p01357_A,01357,A,i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists
p01358_A,01358,A,oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle
p01359_A,01359,A,may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i
p01360_A,01360,A,of course
p01361_A,01361,A,and your sister too
p01362_A,01362,A,of course all presentable people say i
p01363_A,01363,A,but mr wilcox he is not perhaps
p01364_A,01364,A,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either
p01365_A,01365,A,quite so quite so
p01366_A,01366,A,mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired
p01367_A,01367,A,it s better she stops in her room
p01368_A,01368,A,shall i sit up with her
p01369_A,01369,A,no thank you she does not need company
p01370_A,01370,A,mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you
p01371_A,01371,A,no oh no miss schlegel no
p01372_A,01372,A,because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common
p01373_A,01373,A,i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her
p01374_A,01374,A,how long have you been married
p01375_A,01375,A,nearly three years
p01376_A,01376,A,what did your people say
p01377_A,01377,A,they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether
p01378_A,01378,A,my good boy what a mess who are your people and your grandparents
p01379_A,01379,A,they were just nothing at all agricultural labourers and that sort
p01380_A,01380,A,so from which part
p01381_A,01381,A,lincolnshire mostly but my mother s father he oddly enough came from these parts round here
p01382_A,01382,A,from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast
p01383_A,01383,A,oh i don t know
p01384_A,01384,A,excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now
p01385_A,01385,A,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not
p01386_A,01386,A,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men
p01387_A,01387,A,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking
p01388_A,01388,A,settle down to what
p01389_A,01389,A,oh just settle down
p01390_A,01390,A,and that s to be life how can you with all the beautiful things to see and do with music with walking at night
p01391_A,01391,A,walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful
p01392_A,01392,A,why not
p01393_A,01393,A,because i see one must have money
p01394_A,01394,A,well you re wrong
p01395_A,01395,A,i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream
p01396_A,01396,A,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i
p01397_A,01397,A,i wonder
p01398_A,01398,A,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever
p01399_A,01399,A,i am as afraid of death as any one
p01400_A,01400,A,but not of the idea of death
p01401_A,01401,A,but what is the difference
p01402_A,01402,A,infinite difference
p01403_A,01403,A,i must be stupid
p01404_A,01404,A,i have asked helen to sleep she is best here so don t lock the front door
p01405_A,01405,A,i thought some one had got in
p01406_A,01406,A,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him i don t know about later but now the basts must clearly go
p01407_A,01407,A,is she to be shown up to your room
p01408_A,01408,A,i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed will you tell the servants about helen could some one go to carry her bag you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear
p01409_A,01409,A,far too much screaming there
p01410_A,01410,A,henry dear henry dear look at me no i won t have you shirking look at me there that s all
p01411_A,01411,A,you re referring to last evening i have released you from your engagement i could find excuses but i won t no i won t a thousand times no i m a bad lot and must be left at that
p01412_A,01412,A,leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference
p01413_A,01413,A,no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man
p01414_A,01414,A,it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess
p01415_A,01415,A,cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference
p01416_A,01416,A,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast
p01417_A,01417,A,good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth
p01418_A,01418,A,didn t she send me a message or anything
p01419_A,01419,A,i heard of none
p01420_A,01420,A,would you ring the bell please
p01421_A,01421,A,what to do
p01422_A,01422,A,why to inquire i ll go thank you
p01423_A,01423,A,it is no good those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started i have known cases of other men i despised them once i thought that i m different i shall never be tempted oh margaret we fellows all come to grief once in our time will you believe that there are moments when the strongest man that s true isn t it if you knew all you would excuse me i was far from good influences far even from england i was very very lonely and longed for a woman s voice that s enough i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now
p01424_A,01424,A,yes that s enough dear
p01425_A,01425,A,i have i have been through hell
p01426_A,01426,A,i have already forgiven you henry
p01427_A,01427,A,well let them go the man and his wife i mean for the more we see of your sister the better
p01428_A,01428,A,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means
p01429_A,01429,A,what did you say in the notes
p01430_A,01430,A,i told you last night
p01431_A,01431,A,oh ah yes dear would you like one turn in the garden
p01432_A,01432,A,yes yes henry
p01433_A,01433,A,i am far from a saint in fact the reverse but you have taken me for better or worse bygones must be bygones you have promised to forgive me margaret a promise is a promise never mention that woman again
p01434_A,01434,A,except for some practical reason never
p01435_A,01435,A,practical you practical
p01436_A,01436,A,yes i m practical
p01437_A,01437,A,i have come from oniton there has been a great deal of trouble there
p01438_A,01438,A,who s for lunch why such an early start
p01439_A,01439,A,sunrise or something when i could get away
p01440_A,01440,A,so i surmise why
p01441_A,01441,A,i don t know what s to be done tibby i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place i stopped here to tell you this give meg my love and say that i want to be alone i mean to go to munich or else bonn
p01442_A,01442,A,such a message is easily given
p01443_A,01443,A,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though my head is rather wretched i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in not there
p01444_A,01444,A,do you mind mrs martlett coming in or shall i take it from her at the door
p01445_A,01445,A,could i bathe my eyes tibby now for the explanation why didn t i begin with it i have found out something about mr wilcox he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people s lives it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do mrs bast
p01446_A,01446,A,oh those people shall i lock the door again
p01447_A,01447,A,no thanks tibbikins you re being very good to me i want to tell you the story before i go abroad you must do exactly what you like treat it as part of the furniture meg cannot have heard it yet i think but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself i don t even know whether she ought to be told knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match i simply don t know what to make of such a thing i trust your judgment what would you do
p01448_A,01448,A,i gather he has had a mistress
p01449_A,01449,A,and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself
p01450_A,01450,A,it is certainly a very bad business
p01451_A,01451,A,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion but you are right outside it and you must know in a day or two or perhaps a week take whatever steps you think fit i leave it in your hands the facts as they touch meg are all before you
p01452_A,01452,A,you see helen have a cigarette i don t see what i m to do
p01453_A,01453,A,then there s nothing to be done i dare say you are right let them marry there remains the question of compensation
p01454_A,01454,A,do you want me to adjudicate that too had you not better consult an expert
p01455_A,01455,A,this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this
p01456_A,01456,A,what is the sum
p01457_A,01457,A,five thousand
p01458_A,01458,A,good god alive
p01459_A,01459,A,now what is the good of driblets to go through life having done one thing to have raised one person from the abyss not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets making the grey more grey no doubt people will think me extraordinary
p01460_A,01460,A,i don t care an iota what people think but it s half what you have
p01461_A,01461,A,not nearly half i have far too much and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two it isn t enough i didn t expect you to understand me
p01462_A,01462,A,i i understand nobody
p01463_A,01463,A,i didn t want to bother you besides i have only heard for certain this morning
p01464_A,01464,A,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp
p01465_A,01465,A,my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special
p01466_A,01466,A,why did you go there then
p01467_A,01467,A,i because why have we come to the tyrol if it comes to that one might go on asking such questions indefinitely the truth is i took oniton on account of evie don t let this go any further
p01468_A,01468,A,certainly not
p01469_A,01469,A,i shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged poor little girl she was so keen on it all and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting afraid it would get snapped up just like all of your sex well no harm s done she has had her country wedding and i ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school
p01470_A,01470,A,where shall we live then henry i should enjoy living somewhere
p01471_A,01471,A,i have not yet decided what about norfolk it is now what nearly october let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring
p01472_A,01472,A,if possible something permanent i can t be as young as i was for these alterations don t suit me
p01473_A,01473,A,but my dear which would you rather have alterations or rheumatism
p01474_A,01474,A,i see your point if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys only in the spring let us look before we leap i will take warning by evie and not hurry you remember that you have a free hand this time these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive
p01475_A,01475,A,have you heard the news charles is so ang i mean he is sure you know about it or rather that you don t know
p01476_A,01476,A,why dolly here s a surprise how are the boys and the baby
p01477_A,01477,A,but lucky you with four courts of your own at midhurst
p01478_A,01478,A,it will be very jolly
p01479_A,01479,A,are those the plans does it matter my seeing them
p01480_A,01480,A,of course not
p01481_A,01481,A,charles has never seen the plans
p01482_A,01482,A,they have only just arrived here is the ground floor no that s rather difficult try the elevation we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky line
p01483_A,01483,A,what makes it smell so funny
p01484_A,01484,A,i suppose the paper
p01485_A,01485,A,and which way up is it
p01486_A,01486,A,just the ordinary way up that s the sky line and the part that smells strongest is the sky
p01487_A,01487,A,well ask me another margaret oh what was i going to say how s helen
p01488_A,01488,A,quite well
p01489_A,01489,A,is she never coming back to england every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t
p01490_A,01490,A,so it is helen is odd awfully she has now been away eight months
p01491_A,01491,A,but hasn t she any address
p01492_A,01492,A,a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address do write her a line i will look it up for you
p01493_A,01493,A,no don t bother that s eight months she has been away surely
p01494_A,01494,A,exactly she left just after evie s wedding it would be eight months
p01495_A,01495,A,just when baby was born then
p01496_A,01496,A,just so
p01497_A,01497,A,oh yes that is it miss avery has been unpacking your packing cases
p01498_A,01498,A,why has she done that how unnecessary
p01499_A,01499,A,ask another i suppose you ordered her to
p01500_A,01500,A,i gave no such orders perhaps she was airing the things she did undertake to light an occasional fire
p01501_A,01501,A,it was far more than an air the floor sounds covered with books charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don t know
p01502_A,01502,A,books dolly are you serious has she been touching our books
p01503_A,01503,A,hasn t she though what used to be the hall s full of them charles thought for certain you knew of it
p01504_A,01504,A,i am very much obliged to you dolly what can have come over miss avery i must go down about it at once some of the books are my brother s and are quite valuable she had no right to open any of the cases
p01505_A,01505,A,i say she s dotty she was the one that never got married you know oh i say perhaps she thinks your books are wedding presents to herself old maids are taken that way sometimes miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie
p01506_A,01506,A,i hadn t heard of that
p01507_A,01507,A,didn t you know she gave evie a present last august and evie returned it and then oh goloshes you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote
p01508_A,01508,A,but it was wrong of evie to return it it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing
p01509_A,01509,A,but the present was so expensive
p01510_A,01510,A,why does that make any difference dolly
p01511_A,01511,A,still when it costs over five pounds i didn t see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman now can you
p01512_A,01512,A,you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married
p01513_A,01513,A,oh mine was old earthenware stuff not worth a halfpenny evie s was quite different you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do evie didn t want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble
p01514_A,01514,A,but miss avery said
p01515_A,01515,A,it was a perfectly awful letter charles said it was the letter of a madman in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond
p01516_A,01516,A,did she give any reasons
p01517_A,01517,A,we think she meant to be invited to oniton and so climb into society
p01518_A,01518,A,she s rather old for that may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother
p01519_A,01519,A,that s a notion give every one their due eh well i suppose i ought to be toddling come along mr muff you want a new coat but i don t know who ll give it you i m sure oh yes
p01520_A,01520,A,i wonder then why he let me ask her to look after the house
p01521_A,01521,A,are you sure that miss avery is up here
p01522_A,01522,A,well well if it isn t mrs wilcox come at last
p01523_A,01523,A,have you got the key auntie
p01524_A,01524,A,madge go away
p01525_A,01525,A,auntie it s mrs wilcox
p01526_A,01526,A,your niece and i have come together
p01527_A,01527,A,madge go away this is no moment for your hat
p01528_A,01528,A,auntie gets more eccentric lately
p01529_A,01529,A,miss avery i have come about the furniture could you kindly let me in
p01530_A,01530,A,yes mrs wilcox of course
p01531_A,01531,A,i hope miss avery is not ill
p01532_A,01532,A,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p01533_A,01533,A,well come right in mrs wilcox
p01534_A,01534,A,thank you so much
p01535_A,01535,A,come right into the hall first
p01536_A,01536,A,i m afraid this isn t what we meant mr wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched for instance these books are my brother s we are storing them for him and for my sister who is abroad when you kindly undertook to look after things we never expected you to do so much
p01537_A,01537,A,the house has been empty long enough
p01538_A,01538,A,i dare say we didn t explain it has been a mistake and very likely our mistake
p01539_A,01539,A,mrs wilcox it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years the house is mrs wilcox s and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer
p01540_A,01540,A,yes mrs wilcox s house the mother of mr charles
p01541_A,01541,A,mistake upon mistake mistake upon mistake
p01542_A,01542,A,well i don t know i really don t know what s to be done
p01543_A,01543,A,yes it should be a merry house enough
p01544_A,01544,A,i don t know i dare say well thank you very much miss avery yes that s all right delightful
p01545_A,01545,A,there is still the parlour and the dining room then through here i ve not finished here yet there s still a deal to do the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs for there is no need to go into expense at hilton
p01546_A,01546,A,it is all a mistake a misunderstanding mr wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end
p01547_A,01547,A,oh indeed on account of his hay fever
p01548_A,01548,A,we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex and part of this furniture my part will go down there presently
p01549_A,01549,A,you think that you won t come back to live here mrs wilcox but you will
p01550_A,01550,A,that remains to be seen we have no intention of doing so for the present we happen to need a much larger house circumstances oblige us to give big parties of course some day one never knows does one
p01551_A,01551,A,some day tcha tcha don t talk about some day you are living here now
p01552_A,01552,A,am i
p01553_A,01553,A,you are living here and have been for the last ten minutes if you ask me the nursery
p01554_A,01554,A,it s a beautiful meadow
p01555_A,01555,A,yes the maidy s well enough for those that is who don t suffer from sneezing i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time oh they ought to do this they mustn t do that he d learn them to be lads and just then the tickling took him he has it from his father with other things there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth
p01556_A,01556,A,my brother gets hay fever too
p01557_A,01557,A,this house lies too much on the land for them naturally they were glad enough to slip in at first but wilcoxes are better than nothing as i see you ve found they keep a place going don t they yes it is just that
p01558_A,01558,A,they keep england going it is my opinion
p01559_A,01559,A,ay they breed like rabbits well well it s a funny world but he who made it knows what he wants in it i suppose if mrs charlie is expecting her fourth it isn t for us to repine
p01560_A,01560,A,they breed and they also work it certainly is a funny world but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it i think it ll never be a bad one never really bad
p01561_A,01561,A,no better n nothing i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died but we stayed civil it was a very civil family old mrs howard never spoke against anybody nor let any one be turned away without food then it was never trespassers will be prosecuted in their land but would people please not come in mrs howard was never created to run a farm
p01562_A,01562,A,had they no men to help them
p01563_A,01563,A,things went on until there were no men
p01564_A,01564,A,until mr wilcox came along
p01565_A,01565,A,i suppose so but ruth should have married a no disrespect to you to say this for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way whether she got him first or no
p01566_A,01566,A,whom should she have married
p01567_A,01567,A,a soldier some real soldier but that s all over a better time is coming now though you ve kept me long enough waiting in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening have you ordered in coals
p01568_A,01568,A,we are not coming no not coming never coming it has all been a mistake the furniture must be repacked at once and i am very sorry but i am making other arrangements and must ask you to give me the keys
p01569_A,01569,A,to really take my tiresome chest in hand important margaret dear take the lulworth when helen comes
p01570_A,01570,A,helen won t be able to stop aunt juley she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
p01571_A,01571,A,how very odd of helen mr wilcox
p01572_A,01572,A,yes dear
p01573_A,01573,A,can he spare you margaret important i should like you to have some companion to take walks with do try miss conder
p01574_A,01574,A,i have been for a little walk with miss conder
p01575_A,01575,A,but she is not really interesting if only you had helen
p01576_A,01576,A,i have tibby aunt juley
p01577_A,01577,A,no but he has to do his chinese some real companion is what you need really helen is odd
p01578_A,01578,A,helen is odd very
p01579_A,01579,A,not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once
p01580_A,01580,A,why don t you tell mr wilcox
p01581_A,01581,A,about helen
p01582_A,01582,A,perhaps he has come across that sort of thing
p01583_A,01583,A,he would do all he could but
p01584_A,01584,A,oh you know best but he is practical
p01585_A,01585,A,tibby love what next
p01586_A,01586,A,it is extraordinary
p01587_A,01587,A,dear your judgment s often clearer than mine have you any notion what s at the back
p01588_A,01588,A,none unless it s something mental
p01589_A,01589,A,just like helen
p01590_A,01590,A,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p01591_A,01591,A,don t ask me i m a plain man of business i live and let live my advice to you both is don t worry margaret you ve got black marks again under your eyes you know that s strictly forbidden first your aunt then your sister no we aren t going to have it are we theobald i ll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband
p01592_A,01592,A,all the same you have not quite seen our point
p01593_A,01593,A,i don t suppose i ever shall
p01594_A,01594,A,margaret s point is this our sister may be mad
p01595_A,01595,A,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p01596_A,01596,A,i m afraid i cannot what are the facts we are all mad more or less you know in these days
p01597_A,01597,A,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p01598_A,01598,A,she has never behaved like this before then
p01599_A,01599,A,of course not
p01600_A,01600,A,well my dear how am i to know
p01601_A,01601,A,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely
p01602_A,01602,A,oh yes she and i have always hit it off together
p01603_A,01603,A,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean
p01604_A,01604,A,you want to get hold of her that s the problem isn t it she has got to see a doctor
p01605_A,01605,A,for all i know she has seen one already
p01606_A,01606,A,yes yes don t interrupt i ve got it it s perfectly easy leave it to me we ll send her down to howards end
p01607_A,01607,A,how will you do that
p01608_A,01608,A,after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there
p01609_A,01609,A,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me
p01610_A,01610,A,of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time
p01611_A,01611,A,it doesn t seem impossible to me it is surely a very tippy plan
p01612_A,01612,A,it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame
p01613_A,01613,A,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p01614_A,01614,A,no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t
p01615_A,01615,A,i see you have scruples
p01616_A,01616,A,i suppose so
p01617_A,01617,A,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness
p01618_A,01618,A,i deny it s madness
p01619_A,01619,A,you said just now
p01620_A,01620,A,it s madness when i say it but not when you say it
p01621_A,01621,A,margaret margaret no education can teach a woman logic now my dear my time is valuable do you want me to help you or not
p01622_A,01622,A,not in that way
p01623_A,01623,A,answer my question plain question plain answer do
p01624_A,01624,A,pater we may as well keep howards end out of it
p01625_A,01625,A,why charles
p01626_A,01626,A,the whole house is at sixes and sevens we don t want any more mess
p01627_A,01627,A,who s we my boy pray who s we
p01628_A,01628,A,i am sure i beg your pardon i appear always to be intruding
p01629_A,01629,A,i can t have this sort of behaviour my boy margaret s too sweet natured to mind but i mind for her is anything wrong with you charles this afternoon
p01630_A,01630,A,don t ask me
p01631_A,01631,A,she was bound to drive there will be her books
p01632_A,01632,A,i cannot make it out
p01633_A,01633,A,finish your coffee dear we must be off
p01634_A,01634,A,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p01635_A,01635,A,you re not fit for it let me go alone i know exactly what to do
p01636_A,01636,A,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off
p01637_A,01637,A,don t you want to tidy yourself
p01638_A,01638,A,have i time
p01639_A,01639,A,dolly i m going without her tell her i thought it best
p01640_A,01640,A,yes mr wilcox i see
p01641_A,01641,A,i still consider you are not fit for it
p01642_A,01642,A,perhaps i was not at lunch but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now
p01643_A,01643,A,i was meaning to act for the best
p01644_A,01644,A,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so
p01645_A,01645,A,certainly dear girl are you all right now
p01646_A,01646,A,look my hands have stopped trembling
p01647_A,01647,A,is the truant all right
p01648_A,01648,A,margaret you look upset you might have given me a knock with the gate
p01649_A,01649,A,go away
p01650_A,01650,A,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen
p01651_A,01651,A,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all
p01652_A,01652,A,manage what
p01653_A,01653,A,stop that at least
p01654_A,01654,A,come this is an odd beginning
p01655_A,01655,A,i cannot help it do wait it s not my fault please all four of you go away now
p01656_A,01656,A,we are relying on you to help us mrs wilcox could you go in and persuade your sister to come out
p01657_A,01657,A,on what grounds i beg your pardon but it is nothing of the sort you are not qualified to attend my sister mr mansbridge if we require your services we will let you know
p01658_A,01658,A,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish
p01659_A,01659,A,you could but you have not you are therefore not qualified to attend my sister
p01660_A,01660,A,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door
p01661_A,01661,A,forgive me but i will not
p01662_A,01662,A,i don t agree
p01663_A,01663,A,this business is as broad as it s long we had better all work together you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
p01664_A,01664,A,quite so
p01665_A,01665,A,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
p01666_A,01666,A,margaret margaret
p01667_A,01667,A,well henry send your doctor away what possible use is he now it all turns on affection now affection don t you see surely you see i like helen very much you not so much mr mansbridge doesn t know her that s all and affection when reciprocated gives rights put that down in your note book mr mansbridge it s a useful formula you don t know what you want yourselves for one sensible remark i will let you in but you cannot make it you would trouble my sister for no reason i will not permit it i ll stand here all the day sooner
p01668_A,01668,A,oh my darling my darling forgive me
p01669_A,01669,A,convenient you did not tell me that the books were unpacked i have found nearly everything that i want
p01670_A,01670,A,i told you nothing that was true
p01671_A,01671,A,it has been a great surprise certainly has aunt juley been ill
p01672_A,01672,A,helen you wouldn t think i d invent that
p01673_A,01673,A,i suppose not but one loses faith in everything after this
p01674_A,01674,A,we thought it was illness but even then i haven t behaved worthily i ought not to have consulted any one what would our father have thought of me
p01675_A,01675,A,yes i am annoyed my wishes should have been respected i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary planning my life as i now have to do
p01676_A,01676,A,come away from those books helen do talk to me
p01677_A,01677,A,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard one can t go through a great deal of without planning one s actions in advance i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me i will go through them if necessary but only then in the second place i have no right to trouble people i cannot fit in with england as i know it i have done something that the english never pardon it would not be right for them to pardon it so i must live where i am not known
p01678_A,01678,A,but why didn t you tell me dearest
p01679_A,01679,A,yes i might have but decided to wait
p01680_A,01680,A,i believe you would never have told me
p01681_A,01681,A,oh yes i should we have taken a flat in munich by we i mean myself and monica but for her i am and have been and always wish to be alone
p01682_A,01682,A,i have not heard of monica
p01683_A,01683,A,you wouldn t have she s an italian by birth at least she makes her living by journalism i met her originally on garda monica is much the best person to see me through
p01684_A,01684,A,you are very fond of her then
p01685_A,01685,A,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me you must not think that we shall never meet i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better but you haven t understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you this is a shock to you it isn t to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps such as this i cannot live in england
p01686_A,01686,A,helen you ve not forgiven me for my treachery you couldn t talk like this to me if you had
p01687_A,01687,A,oh meg dear why do we talk at all tell me how is it that all the books are down here
p01688_A,01688,A,series of mistakes
p01689_A,01689,A,who lives here then
p01690_A,01690,A,no one
p01691_A,01691,A,i suppose you are letting it though
p01692_A,01692,A,the house is dead why worry on about it
p01693_A,01693,A,but i am interested you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life i am still helen i hope now this hasn t the feel of a dead house the hall seems more alive even than in the old days when it held the wilcoxes own things
p01694_A,01694,A,interested are you very well i must tell you i suppose my husband lent it on condition we but by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of look here i can t go on like this i warn you i won t helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry
p01695_A,01695,A,i don t hate him now i have stopped being a schoolgirl and meg once again i m not being unkind but as for fitting in with your english life no put it out of your head at once imagine a visit from me at ducie street it s unthinkable tell me about yourself
p01696_A,01696,A,there s nothing to tell
p01697_A,01697,A,but your marriage has been happy meg
p01698_A,01698,A,yes but i don t feel inclined to talk
p01699_A,01699,A,you feel as i do
p01700_A,01700,A,not that but i can t
p01701_A,01701,A,no more can i it is a nuisance but no good trying look here meg is the coast clear
p01702_A,01702,A,you mean that you want to go away from me
p01703_A,01703,A,i suppose so dear old lady it isn t any use i knew we should have nothing to say give my love to aunt juley and tibby and take more yourself than i can say promise to come and see me in munich later
p01704_A,01704,A,certainly dearest
p01705_A,01705,A,for that is all we can do i am glad to have seen you and the things
p01706_A,01706,A,please lady a message
p01707_A,01707,A,how did this come henry would have done what he could
p01708_A,01708,A,this is mr wilcox s house
p01709_A,01709,A,surely you remember howards end
p01710_A,01710,A,remember i who remember everything but it looks to be ours now
p01711_A,01711,A,miss avery was extraordinary she loved mrs wilcox and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty in consequence here are all the library books
p01712_A,01712,A,not all the books she hasn t unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense and we never used to have the sword here
p01713_A,01713,A,yes doesn t it
p01714_A,01714,A,where s the piano meg
p01715_A,01715,A,curious too that the carpet fits
p01716_A,01716,A,the carpet s a mistake i know that we had it in london but this floor ought to be bare it is far too beautiful
p01717_A,01717,A,you still have a mania for under furnishing would you care to come into the dining room before you start there s no carpet there
p01718_A,01718,A,oh what a place for mother s chiffonier
p01719_A,01719,A,look at the chairs though
p01720_A,01720,A,oh look at them wickham place faced north didn t it
p01721_A,01721,A,north west
p01722_A,01722,A,anyhow it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun feel their dear little backs are quite warm
p01723_A,01723,A,but why has miss avery made them set to partners i shall just
p01724_A,01724,A,over here meg put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn ye es the window s too high
p01725_A,01725,A,try a drawing room chair
p01726_A,01726,A,no i don t like the drawing room so much the beam has been match boarded it would have been so beautiful otherwise
p01727_A,01727,A,helen what a memory you have for some things you re perfectly right it s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women men don t know what we want
p01728_A,01728,A,and never will
p01729_A,01729,A,i don t agree in two thousand years they ll know look where tibby spilt the soup
p01730_A,01730,A,coffee it was coffee surely impossible tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time
p01731_A,01731,A,then you re right and it must have been soup i was thinking of much later that unsuccessful visit of aunt juley s when she didn t realise that tibby had grown up it was coffee then for he threw it down on purpose there was some rhyme tea coffee coffee tea that she said to him every morning at breakfast wait a minute how did it go
p01732_A,01732,A,i know no i don t what a detestable boy tibby was
p01733_A,01733,A,but the rhyme was simply awful no decent person could put up with it
p01734_A,01734,A,ah that greengage tree why do i connect it with dumb bells and there come the chickens the grass wants cutting i love yellow hammers
p01735_A,01735,A,i have got it that every morning for three weeks no wonder tibby was wild
p01736_A,01736,A,tibby is moderately a dear now
p01737_A,01737,A,there i knew you d say that in the end of course he s a dear listen what s that
p01738_A,01738,A,perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege
p01739_A,01739,A,what nonsense listen
p01740_A,01740,A,it is always meg
p01741_A,01741,A,little boy what do you want
p01742_A,01742,A,please i am the milk
p01743_A,01743,A,did miss avery send you
p01744_A,01744,A,yes please
p01745_A,01745,A,then take it back and say we require no milk no it s not the siege but possibly an attempt to provision us against one
p01746_A,01746,A,but i like milk why send it away
p01747_A,01747,A,do you oh very well but we ve nothing to put it in and he wants the can
p01748_A,01748,A,please i m to call in the morning for the can
p01749_A,01749,A,the house will be locked up then
p01750_A,01750,A,in the morning would i bring eggs too
p01751_A,01751,A,are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week well run away and do it again
p01752_A,01752,A,tom this one here is margaret and at home we ve another called tibby
p01753_A,01753,A,mine are lop eareds
p01754_A,01754,A,you re a very good and rather a clever little boy mind you come again isn t he charming
p01755_A,01755,A,undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers
p01756_A,01756,A,what do you mean
p01757_A,01757,A,i don t know
p01758_A,01758,A,because i probably agree with you
p01759_A,01759,A,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live
p01760_A,01760,A,i do agree but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago
p01761_A,01761,A,meaning that i was dead i felt it
p01762_A,01762,A,yes the house has a surer life than we even if it was empty and as it is i can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture after all wickham place was a grave meg i ve a startling idea
p01763_A,01763,A,what is it
p01764_A,01764,A,drink some milk to steady you no i won t tell you yet because you may laugh or be angry let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing then one would see really about my idea couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night
p01765_A,01765,A,i don t think we could well do that
p01766_A,01766,A,here are beds tables towels
p01767_A,01767,A,i know but the house isn t supposed to be slept in and henry s suggestion was
p01768_A,01768,A,i require no suggestions i shall not alter anything in my plans but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you it will be something to look back on oh meg lovey do let s
p01769_A,01769,A,but helen my pet we can t without getting henry s leave of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate
p01770_A,01770,A,ducie street is his house this is ours our furniture our sort of people coming to the door do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk why not it s a moon
p01771_A,01771,A,i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles
p01772_A,01772,A,i know he won t like it but i am going to pass out of their lives what difference will it make in the long run if they say and she even spent the night at howards end
p01773_A,01773,A,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before
p01774_A,01774,A,because my plans
p01775_A,01775,A,which you change in a moment
p01776_A,01776,A,then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home
p01777_A,01777,A,it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand
p01778_A,01778,A,yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you
p01779_A,01779,A,i needn t say how much it would mean to me
p01780_A,01780,A,then let us
p01781_A,01781,A,it is no good hesitating shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave
p01782_A,01782,A,oh we don t want leave charles may say no
p01783_A,01783,A,we shan t consult him
p01784_A,01784,A,go if you like i should have stopped without leave
p01785_A,01785,A,expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing
p01786_A,01786,A,but the diddums can t listen he isn t nine months old
p01787_A,01787,A,is it what we feared
p01788_A,01788,A,it is
p01789_A,01789,A,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring
p01790_A,01790,A,no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end
p01791_A,01791,A,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you
p01792_A,01792,A,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name
p01793_A,01793,A,would she not tell you
p01794_A,01794,A,i never even asked her who seduced her
p01795_A,01795,A,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you
p01796_A,01796,A,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills
p01797_A,01797,A,as you like
p01798_A,01798,A,have you anything else to ask me henry
p01799_A,01799,A,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us
p01800_A,01800,A,who is we
p01801_A,01801,A,i thought it best to ring up charles
p01802_A,01802,A,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain
p01803_A,01803,A,he has at once gone to call on your brother
p01804_A,01804,A,that too was unnecessary
p01805_A,01805,A,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name
p01806_A,01806,A,are we to make her seducer marry her
p01807_A,01807,A,if possible yes
p01808_A,01808,A,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases
p01809_A,01809,A,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life
p01810_A,01810,A,may i ask you my question now
p01811_A,01811,A,certainly my dear
p01812_A,01812,A,to morrow helen goes to munich
p01813_A,01813,A,well possibly she is right
p01814_A,01814,A,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end
p01815_A,01815,A,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel
p01816_A,01816,A,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending
p01817_A,01817,A,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact
p01818_A,01818,A,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it
p01819_A,01819,A,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold
p01820_A,01820,A,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to
p01821_A,01821,A,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps
p01822_A,01822,A,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow
p01823_A,01823,A,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too
p01824_A,01824,A,she cannot be left alone
p01825_A,01825,A,that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles
p01826_A,01826,A,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him
p01827_A,01827,A,margaret my margaret
p01828_A,01828,A,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all
p01829_A,01829,A,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles
p01830_A,01830,A,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property
p01831_A,01831,A,my dear you are forgetting yourself
p01832_A,01832,A,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking
p01833_A,01833,A,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did
p01834_A,01834,A,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough
p01835_A,01835,A,as i have actually been forgiven
p01836_A,01836,A,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question
p01837_A,01837,A,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once
p01838_A,01838,A,you have mentioned mrs wilcox
p01839_A,01839,A,i beg your pardon
p01840_A,01840,A,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast
p01841_A,01841,A,you have not been yourself all day
p01842_A,01842,A,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done
p01843_A,01843,A,the two cases are different
p01844_A,01844,A,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry
p01845_A,01845,A,i suppose you realise that you are your sister s protector
p01846_A,01846,A,in what sense
p01847_A,01847,A,if a man played about with my sister i d send a bullet through him but perhaps you don t mind
p01848_A,01848,A,i mind very much
p01849_A,01849,A,who d ye suspect then speak out man one always suspects some one
p01850_A,01850,A,no one i don t think so
p01851_A,01851,A,you are hiding something when you saw her last did she mention any one s name yes or no
p01852_A,01852,A,in my rooms she mentioned some friends called the basts
p01853_A,01853,A,who are the basts
p01854_A,01854,A,people friends of hers at evie s wedding
p01855_A,01855,A,one isolates i isolated mr wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill consequently i was full of pity and almost of revenge for weeks i had blamed mr wilcox only and so when your letters came
p01856_A,01856,A,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others
p01857_A,01857,A,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts
p01858_A,01858,A,looking back that was wrong of me
p01859_A,01859,A,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul
p01860_A,01860,A,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge
p01861_A,01861,A,i did react until i found poor leonard i am steady now i shan t ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy yes i do at last understand
p01862_A,01862,A,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements
p01863_A,01863,A,because in death i agree
p01864_A,01864,A,good night mrs wilcox
p01865_A,01865,A,oh good night miss avery
p01866_A,01866,A,why should miss avery work for us
p01867_A,01867,A,why indeed
p01868_A,01868,A,this is not quite our house yet when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists
p01869_A,01869,A,we shall be that everywhere and for ever
p01870_A,01870,A,but affectionate tourists
p01871_A,01871,A,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home
p01872_A,01872,A,i can t pretend very long sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case unless you will come with me
p01873_A,01873,A,are you serious in asking me helen should i get on with your monica
p01874_A,01874,A,you would not but i am serious in asking you
p01875_A,01875,A,does mrs wilcox live here
p01876_A,01876,A,she s out
p01877_A,01877,A,when will she be back
p01878_A,01878,A,i don t know hilton howards end who is it
p01879_A,01879,A,i ll ask sir
p01880_A,01880,A,no don t bother
p01881_A,01881,A,they have taken the car to howards end you appear to want to know a good deal
p01882_A,01882,A,is it a village please
p01883_A,01883,A,village it s mr wilcox s private house at least it s one of them mrs wilcox keeps her furniture there hilton is the village
p01884_A,01884,A,yes and when will they be back
p01885_A,01885,A,mr schlegel doesn t know we can t know everything can we
p01886_A,01886,A,i say jacky i m going out for a bit
p01887_A,01887,A,hullo len what ho len
p01888_A,01888,A,oh is he there i am not surprised i now thrash him within an inch of his life
p01889_A,01889,A,mrs wilcox i have done wrong
p01890_A,01890,A,that s enough
p01891_A,01891,A,yes murder s enough
p01892_A,01892,A,i don t know where she is pater dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her
p01893_A,01893,A,tell me when she comes in
p01894_A,01894,A,i ll sit up for her as late as you like but she can hardly be coming isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel
p01895_A,01895,A,perhaps perhaps
p01896_A,01896,A,can i do anything for you sir
p01897_A,01897,A,i don t want you to conclude that my wife and i had anything of the nature of a quarrel she was only overwrought as who would not be i shall do what i can for helen but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once do you see that is a sine qua non
p01898_A,01898,A,then at eight to morrow i may go up in the car
p01899_A,01899,A,eight or earlier say that you are acting as my representative and of course use no violence charles
p01900_A,01900,A,it has been pretty horrible they were there and they had the man up there with them too
p01901_A,01901,A,what what man
p01902_A,01902,A,i told you last night his name was bast
p01903_A,01903,A,my god is it possible in your mother s house charles in your mother s house
p01904_A,01904,A,i know pater that was what i felt as a matter of fact there is no need to trouble about the man he was in the last stages of heart disease and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off the police are seeing about it at this moment i got up there oh it couldn t have been more than half past seven the avery woman was lighting a fire for them they were still upstairs i waited in the drawing room we were all moderately civil and collected though i had my suspicions i gave them your message and mrs wilcox said in that way of hers
p01905_A,01905,A,nothing else
p01906_A,01906,A,i promised to tell you with her love that she was going to germany with her sister this evening that was all we had time for because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding for suddenly mrs wilcox screamed out his name i recognised it and i went for him in the hall was i right pater i thought things were going a little too far
p01907_A,01907,A,right my dear boy i don t know but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t then did he just just crumple up as you said
p01908_A,01908,A,he caught hold of the bookcase which came down over him so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden we all thought he was shamming however he s dead right enough awful business
p01909_A,01909,A,sword what sword whose sword
p01910_A,01910,A,a sword of theirs
p01911_A,01911,A,what were you doing with it
p01912_A,01912,A,well didn t you see pater i had to snatch up the first thing handy i hadn t a riding whip or stick i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword
p01913_A,01913,A,then what
p01914_A,01914,A,he pulled over the bookcase as i said and fell
p01915_A,01915,A,but the real cause was heart disease of that you re sure
p01916_A,01916,A,that or a fit however we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics
p01917_A,01917,A,i think i ll go round to the police station
p01918_A,01918,A,what for
p01919_A,01919,A,very well sir which car will you have
p01920_A,01920,A,i think i ll walk
p01921_A,01921,A,it s a good half mile the sun s very hot for april shan t i take you up and then perhaps a little spin round by tewin
p01922_A,01922,A,you go on as if i didn t know my own mind you young fellows one idea is to get into a motor i tell you i want to walk i m very fond of walking
p01923_A,01923,A,oh all right i m about the house if you want me for anything i thought of not going up to the office to day if that is your wish
p01924_A,01924,A,it is indeed my boy
p01925_A,01925,A,no one ever told the lad he ll have a child
p01926_A,01926,A,is it the keys that mr wilcox wants
p01927_A,01927,A,he didn t say madam
p01928_A,01928,A,you haven t any note for me
p01929_A,01929,A,i prefer to discuss things with you outside
p01930_A,01930,A,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p01931_A,01931,A,what about
p01932_A,01932,A,i am going to germany with my sister i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home our talk last night was more important than you have realised i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you
p01933_A,01933,A,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down
p01934_A,01934,A,certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass here are your keys
p01935_A,01935,A,i have something to tell you
p01936_A,01936,A,i don t want to hear it my sister is going to be ill my life is going to be with her now we must manage to build up something she and i and her child
p01937_A,01937,A,where are you going
p01938_A,01938,A,munich we start after the inquest if she is not too ill
p01939_A,01939,A,have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be
p01940_A,01940,A,yes heart disease
p01941_A,01941,A,i haven t any idea do you suppose baby may meg
p01942_A,01942,A,what was that
p01943_A,01943,A,tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay
p01944_A,01944,A,i haven t the least notion
p01945_A,01945,A,now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter will you be as careful as all that
p01946_A,01946,A,that child is a wonderful nursemaid
p01947_A,01947,A,he is fond of baby that s why he does it they re going to be lifelong friends
p01948_A,01948,A,starting at the ages of six and one
p01949_A,01949,A,of course it will be a great thing for tom
p01950_A,01950,A,it may be a greater thing for baby
p01951_A,01951,A,what a time they all are what can they be doing inside i wish henry was out to enjoy this this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house it s very hard
p01952_A,01952,A,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while
p01953_A,01953,A,meg is or isn t he ill i can t make out
p01954_A,01954,A,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing
p01955_A,01955,A,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle
p01956_A,01956,A,dreadfully that is why i wish dolly had not come too to day still he wanted them all to come it has to be
p01957_A,01957,A,why does he want them meg may i tell you something i like henry
p01958_A,01958,A,you d be odd if you didn t
p01959_A,01959,A,i usen t to
p01960_A,01960,A,usen t
p01961_A,01961,A,i like henry because he does worry
p01962_A,01962,A,and he likes you because you don t
p01963_A,01963,A,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree
p01964_A,01964,A,i do not agree i do not
p01965_A,01965,A,yes please
p01966_A,01966,A,baby s not to try and stand there s something wanting in me i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least but i is it some awful appalling criminal defect
p01967_A,01967,A,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p01968_A,01968,A,yes yes but what has leonard got out of life
p01969_A,01969,A,perhaps an adventure
p01970_A,01970,A,is that enough
p01971_A,01971,A,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet
p01972_A,01972,A,no only withered
p01973_A,01973,A,it will sweeten to morrow
p01974_A,01974,A,oh meg you are a person think of the racket and torture this time last year but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried what a change and all through you
p01975_A,01975,A,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter
p01976_A,01976,A,yes but who settled us down you you did it all sweetest though you re too stupid to see living here was your plan i wanted you he wanted you and everyone said it was impossible but you knew just think of our lives without you meg i and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie but you picked up the pieces and made us a home can t it strike you even for a moment that your life has been heroic can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest when you began to act and did all
p01977_A,01977,A,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me
p01978_A,01978,A,i hope it will be permanent
p01979_A,01979,A,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own
p01980_A,01980,A,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past
p01981_A,01981,A,oh take care
p01982_A,01982,A,my father has asked for you we have been talking business but i dare say you knew all about it beforehand
p01983_A,01983,A,is this going to suit everyone because i don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that i have been unfair
p01984_A,01984,A,it s apparently got to suit us
p01985_A,01985,A,i beg your pardon my boy you have only to speak and i will leave the house to you instead
p01986_A,01986,A,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it s no good my settling down here it s not really the country and it s not the town
p01987_A,01987,A,very well does my arrangement suit you evie
p01988_A,01988,A,of course father
p01989_A,01989,A,and you dolly
p01990_A,01990,A,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p01991_A,01991,A,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely and let everyone understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise in consequence i leave my wife no money that is her own wish all that she would have had will be divided among you i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me that is her wish too she also is giving away a great deal of money she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew down in the field is all that clear does everyone understand
p01992_A,01992,A,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
p01993_A,01993,A,don t paul you promised you d take care
p01994_A,01994,A,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p01995_A,01995,A,good bye dad
p01996_A,01996,A,good bye
p01997_A,01997,A,good bye dolly
p01998_A,01998,A,so long father
p01999_A,01999,A,good bye my boy always take care of yourself
p02000_A,02000,A,good bye mrs wilcox
p02001_A,02001,A,could you tell me henry what was that about mrs wilcox having left me howards end
p02002_A,02002,A,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i
p02003_A,02003,A,you didn t darling nothing has been done wrong
p02004_A,02004,A,here they are at last
p00000_B,00000,B,in that case it is far too sudden
p00001_B,00001,B,who knows aunt juley who knows
p00002_B,00002,B,but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely
p00003_B,00003,B,who knows
p00004_B,00004,B,but margaret dear
p00005_B,00005,B,i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street
p00006_B,00006,B,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret
p00007_B,00007,B,the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know
p00008_B,00008,B,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do
p00009_B,00009,B,exactly germans are too thorough
p00010_B,00010,B,of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone and that reminds me helen s letter
p00011_B,00011,B,oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down
p00012_B,00012,B,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather
p00013_B,00013,B,i gathered nothing
p00014_B,00014,B,then in that case
p00015_B,00015,B,in that case i can make no plans don t you see
p00016_B,00016,B,on the contrary
p00017_B,00017,B,i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby
p00018_B,00018,B,then in that case my dear why go down i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you
p00019_B,00019,B,aunt juley i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering
p00020_B,00020,B,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them
p00021_B,00021,B,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk
p00022_B,00022,B,dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters
p00023_B,00023,B,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say
p00024_B,00024,B,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to
p00025_B,00025,B,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off
p00026_B,00026,B,i think probably it must but slowly
p00027_B,00027,B,can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different
p00028_B,00028,B,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me
p00029_B,00029,B,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong
p00030_B,00030,B,so uncivilised
p00031_B,00031,B,oh i used an affected word i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen
p00032_B,00032,B,only with helen
p00033_B,00033,B,mr wilcox she s wanting howards end
p00034_B,00034,B,excuse me asking but are you the younger mr wilcox or the elder
p00035_B,00035,B,the younger can i do anything for you
p00036_B,00036,B,oh well really are you i
p00037_B,00037,B,oh rather miss schlegel is stopping with us did you want to see her
p00038_B,00038,B,that is very kind
p00039_B,00039,B,not at all if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office this way
p00040_B,00040,B,my niece is not with you by any chance
p00041_B,00041,B,no i came over with my father he has gone on north in your train you ll see miss schlegel at lunch you re coming up to lunch i hope
p00042_B,00042,B,i should like to come up
p00043_B,00043,B,in front or behind which do you prefer it may be windy in front
p00044_B,00044,B,in front if i may then we can talk
p00045_B,00045,B,but excuse me one moment i can t think what they re doing with that parcel hi hi you there are you going to keep me waiting all day parcel for wilcox howards end just look sharp this station s abominably organised if i had my way the whole lot of em should get the sack may i help you in
p00046_B,00046,B,this is very good of you very good indeed it is just what i should have wished
p00047_B,00047,B,very good of you to say so i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train
p00048_B,00048,B,you see we heard from helen this morning
p00049_B,00049,B,the mater will be very glad to see you
p00050_B,00050,B,not at all mr wilcox
p00051_B,00051,B,and do you object to going through the village it is rather a longer spin but i have one or two commissions
p00052_B,00052,B,i should love going through the village naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you you can well imagine that the news was a great shock to us
p00053_B,00053,B,what news
p00054_B,00054,B,mr wilcox margaret has told me everything everything i have seen helen s letter
p00055_B,00055,B,i beg your pardon i didn t catch
p00056_B,00056,B,about helen helen of course helen is a very exceptional person i am sure you will let me say this feeling towards her as you do indeed all the schlegels are exceptional i come in no spirit of interference but it was a great shock
p00057_B,00057,B,i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads
p00058_B,00058,B,margaret could not come herself on account of poor tibby so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk
p00059_B,00059,B,i m sorry to be so dense but i still haven t quite understood
p00060_B,00060,B,helen mr wilcox my niece and you
p00061_B,00061,B,miss schlegel and myself
p00062_B,00062,B,i trust there has been no misunderstanding her letter certainly read that way
p00063_B,00063,B,what way
p00064_B,00064,B,that you and she
p00065_B,00065,B,i think i catch your meaning what an extraordinary mistake
p00066_B,00066,B,then you didn t the least
p00067_B,00067,B,scarcely as i am already engaged to another lady oh good god don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s
p00068_B,00068,B,but you are paul
p00069_B,00069,B,i m not
p00070_B,00070,B,then why did you say so at the station
p00071_B,00071,B,i said nothing of the sort i beg your pardon i did not my name is charles do you mean to tell me that paul do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece
p00072_B,00072,B,yes they care for one another very much indeed i dare say they will tell you about it by and by we heard this morning
p00073_B,00073,B,the idiot the idiot the little fool
p00074_B,00074,B,if that is your attitude mr wilcox i prefer to walk
p00075_B,00075,B,i beg you will do no such thing i take you up this moment to the house let me tell you the thing s impossible and must be stopped
p00076_B,00076,B,i quite agree sir the thing is impossible and i will come up and stop it my niece is a very exceptional person and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her considering she has only known your brother since wednesday and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel
p00077_B,00077,B,could you possibly lower your voice the shopman will overhear i warn you paul hasn t a penny it s useless
p00078_B,00078,B,no need to warn us mr wilcox i assure you the warning is all the other way my niece has been very foolish and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me
p00079_B,00079,B,he has to make his way out in nigeria he couldn t think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate and is in other ways why hasn t he told us of course he s ashamed he knows he s been a fool and so he has a downright fool whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news
p00080_B,00080,B,if i were a man mr wilcox for that last remark i d box your ears you re not fit to clean my niece s boots to sit in the same room with her and you dare you actually dare i decline to argue with such a person
p00081_B,00081,B,all i know is she s spread the thing and he hasn t and my father s away and i
p00082_B,00082,B,and all that i know is
p00083_B,00083,B,might i finish my sentence please
p00084_B,00084,B,oh my darling helen
p00085_B,00085,B,paul paul paul is there any truth in this
p00086_B,00086,B,i didn t i don t
p00087_B,00087,B,yes or no man plain question plain answer did or didn t miss schlegel
p00088_B,00088,B,mother are you aware that paul has been playing the fool again
p00089_B,00089,B,it is all right dear they have broken off the engagement
p00090_B,00090,B,i am swathed in cant and it is good for me to be stripped of it
p00091_B,00091,B,it was over at once
p00092_B,00092,B,how helen
p00093_B,00093,B,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times
p00094_B,00094,B,was paul there
p00095_B,00095,B,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness
p00096_B,00096,B,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife
p00097_B,00097,B,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew
p00098_B,00098,B,knew what
p00099_B,00099,B,everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think
p00100_B,00100,B,oh she must have overheard you
p00101_B,00101,B,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that
p00102_B,00102,B,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end
p00103_B,00103,B,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes
p00104_B,00104,B,don t you feel it now
p00105_B,00105,B,i remember paul at breakfast i shall never forget him he had nothing to fall back upon i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever
p00106_B,00106,B,to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within
p00107_B,00107,B,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p00108_B,00108,B,whom is margaret talking to would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in
p00109_B,00109,B,i expect so
p00110_B,00110,B,you girls are so wonderful in always having oh dear one mustn t talk
p00111_B,00111,B,how awful to marry a man like those cupids
p00112_B,00112,B,on the what dear
p00113_B,00113,B,on the drum aunt juley
p00114_B,00114,B,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p00115_B,00115,B,margaret is helen all right
p00116_B,00116,B,oh yes
p00117_B,00117,B,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00118_B,00118,B,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00119_B,00119,B,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00120_B,00120,B,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p00121_B,00121,B,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p00122_B,00122,B,tibby love you must go
p00123_B,00123,B,it isn t of any consequence
p00124_B,00124,B,but of course it is tibby tibby
p00125_B,00125,B,not at all
p00126_B,00126,B,if you would give me your address
p00127_B,00127,B,oh not at all not at all
p00128_B,00128,B,that is where we live if you preferred you could call for the umbrella after the concert but i didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault
p00129_B,00129,B,it s a fine programme this afternoon is it not
p00130_B,00130,B,the beethoven s fine i don t like the brahms though nor the mendelssohn that came first and ugh i don t like this elgar that s coming
p00131_B,00131,B,oh margaret you tiresome girl here have i been persuading herr liesecke to stop for pomp and circumstance and you are undoing all my work i am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in music oh you musn t run down our english composers margaret
p00132_B,00132,B,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00133_B,00133,B,frieda you despise english music you know you do and english art and english literature except shakespeare and he s a german very well frieda you may go
p00134_B,00134,B,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00135_B,00135,B,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
p00136_B,00136,B,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus
p00137_B,00137,B,might i couldn t i
p00138_B,00138,B,oh i would be so grateful
p00139_B,00139,B,thank you
p00140_B,00140,B,how tired one gets after music
p00141_B,00141,B,do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive
p00142_B,00142,B,yes horribly
p00143_B,00143,B,but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive
p00144_B,00144,B,do you go there much
p00145_B,00145,B,when my work permits i attend the gallery for the royal opera this year i have been three times to faust tosca and
p00146_B,00146,B,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p00147_B,00147,B,a specially loud part of course i do not go in for being musical i only care for music a very different thing but still i will say this for myself i do know when i like a thing and when i don t some people are the same about pictures they can go into a picture gallery miss conder can and say straight off what they feel all round the wall i never could do that but music is so different from pictures to my mind when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything there was a thing something about a faun in french which helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
p00148_B,00148,B,do you agree do you think music is so different from pictures
p00149_B,00149,B,i i should have thought so kind of
p00150_B,00150,B,so should i now my sister declares they re just the same we have great arguments over it she says i m dense i say she s sloppy now doesn t it seem absurd to you what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music it s very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process but what s gained i d like to know oh it s all rubbish radically false if monet s really debussy and debussy s really monet neither gentleman is worth his salt that s my opinion now this very symphony that we ve just been having she won t let it alone she labels it with meanings from start to finish turns it into literature i wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music yet i don t know there s my brother behind us he treats music as music and oh my goodness he makes me angrier than any one simply furious with him i daren t even argue but of course the real villain is wagner he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts i do feel that music is in a very serious state just now though extraordinarily interesting every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses like wagner who stir up all the wells of thought at once for a moment it s splendid such a splash as never was but afterwards such a lot of mud and the wells as it were they communicate with each other too easily now and not one of them will run quite clear that s what wagner s done
p00151_B,00151,B,i suppose my umbrella will be all right i don t really mind about it i will think about music instead i suppose my umbrella will be all right shall i try to do without a programme
p00152_B,00152,B,all right
p00153_B,00153,B,you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella
p00154_B,00154,B,taken a what oh what s that do come in how do you do
p00155_B,00155,B,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p00156_B,00156,B,oh i am so sorry i do nothing but steal umbrellas i am so very sorry do come in and choose one is yours a hooky or a nobbly mine s a nobbly at least i think it is
p00157_B,00157,B,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p00158_B,00158,B,whatever have i done
p00159_B,00159,B,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p00160_B,00160,B,oh do stop
p00161_B,00161,B,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00162_B,00162,B,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p00163_B,00163,B,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00164_B,00164,B,i remember something of the sort now
p00165_B,00165,B,better that he had
p00166_B,00166,B,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p00167_B,00167,B,all right auntie tibby
p00168_B,00168,B,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p00169_B,00169,B,so do i tibby only cares for cultured females singing brahms
p00170_B,00170,B,oh it s no good looking superior i mean what i say
p00171_B,00171,B,leave tibby alone
p00172_B,00172,B,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00173_B,00173,B,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00174_B,00174,B,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p00175_B,00175,B,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00176_B,00176,B,a touch of the w s perhaps
p00177_B,00177,B,who are the w s
p00178_B,00178,B,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00179_B,00179,B,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00180_B,00180,B,that house being the w s house i presume
p00181_B,00181,B,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p00182_B,00182,B,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p00183_B,00183,B,if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go even at queen victoria s dinner party if something had been just a little different perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin
p00184_B,00184,B,with an india shawl over her shoulders
p00185_B,00185,B,fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin
p00186_B,00186,B,how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art
p00187_B,00187,B,that reminds me margaret we might have taken that young man into the dining room at all events only the majolica plate and that is so firmly set in the wall i am really distressed that he had no tea
p00188_B,00188,B,evening mr dealtry
p00189_B,00189,B,nice evening

p00221_B,00221,B,when s your birthday len
p00222_B,00222,B,i ve told you again and again the eleventh of november next now get off my knee a bit some one must get supper i suppose it really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted it makes one feel so wild when i ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife all right all right you shall be my wife and i ve bought you the ring to wear and i ve taken this flat furnished and it s far more than i can afford and yet you aren t content and i ve also not told the truth when i ve written home he d stop it my brother d stop it i m going against the whole world jacky that s what i am jacky i don t take any heed of what any one says i just go straight forward i do that s always been my way i m not one of your weak knock kneed chaps if a woman s in trouble i don t leave her in the lurch that s not my street no thank you i ll tell you another thing too i care a good deal about improving myself by means of literature and art and so getting a wider outlook for instance when you came in i was reading ruskin s stones of venice i don t say this to boast but just to show you the kind of man i am i can tell you i enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon
p00223_B,00223,B,but you do love me don t you
p00224_B,00224,B,that tune fairly gives me the hump no i ll play you something lovely get up dear for a minute
p00225_B,00225,B,all right
p00226_B,00226,B,i must clean my boots ready for the morning i rather want to get this chapter done
p00227_B,00227,B,what what s that
p00228_B,00228,B,all right jacky nothing i m reading a book
p00229_B,00229,B,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow
p00230_B,00230,B,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us i didn t tell you at the time it might have made you angry and you had enough to worry you but i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them she didn t answer it
p00231_B,00231,B,how very rude
p00232_B,00232,B,i wonder or was it sensible
p00233_B,00233,B,no margaret most rude
p00234_B,00234,B,in either case one can class it as reassuring
p00235_B,00235,B,but you will be careful won t you
p00236_B,00236,B,oh certainly fiendishly careful
p00237_B,00237,B,and helen must be careful too
p00238_B,00238,B,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p00239_B,00239,B,of course i don t mind it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there s nothing to be grave about at all
p00240_B,00240,B,i m not grave
p00241_B,00241,B,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p00242_B,00242,B,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p00243_B,00243,B,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00244_B,00244,B,hark i hear bruno entering the hall
p00245_B,00245,B,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00246_B,00246,B,come helen
p00247_B,00247,B,go helen
p00248_B,00248,B,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p00249_B,00249,B,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be
p00250_B,00250,B,mr wilcox possibly
p00251_B,00251,B,i knew it and there s mr wilcox
p00252_B,00252,B,it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans
p00253_B,00253,B,it s as well to be prepared
p00254_B,00254,B,no it s as well not to be prepared
p00255_B,00255,B,but imagine the evenings turn the electric light on here or there and it s almost the same room one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you ll see them and the next you yours and they ll see you impossible to sit out on the balconies impossible to water the plants or even speak imagine going out of the front door and they come out opposite at the same moment and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you d rather risk it
p00256_B,00256,B,i hope to risk things all my life
p00257_B,00257,B,oh margaret most dangerous
p00258_B,00258,B,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money
p00259_B,00259,B,oh shame what a shocking speech
p00260_B,00260,B,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none
p00261_B,00261,B,but this is something quite new
p00262_B,00262,B,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin
p00263_B,00263,B,i call that rather cynical
p00264_B,00264,B,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them
p00265_B,00265,B,that s more like socialism
p00266_B,00266,B,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality
p00267_B,00267,B,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh
p00268_B,00268,B,what is it
p00269_B,00269,B,helen was looking up at the wilcoxes flat
p00270_B,00270,B,why shouldn t she
p00271_B,00271,B,i beg your pardon i interrupted you what was it you were saying about reality
p00272_B,00272,B,i had worked round to myself as usual
p00273_B,00273,B,do tell me this at all events are you for the rich or for the poor
p00274_B,00274,B,too difficult ask me another am i for poverty or for riches for riches hurrah for riches
p00275_B,00275,B,for riches
p00276_B,00276,B,yes for riches money for ever
p00277_B,00277,B,so am i and so i am afraid are most of my acquaintances at swanage but i am surprised that you agree with us
p00278_B,00278,B,thank you so much aunt juley while i have talked theories you have done the flowers
p00279_B,00279,B,not at all dear i wish you would let me help you in more important things
p00280_B,00280,B,well would you be very kind would you come round with me to the registry office there s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no
p00281_B,00281,B,staring most rudely
p00282_B,00282,B,helen you must tell me whether this thing worries you
p00283_B,00283,B,if what
p00284_B,00284,B,the ws coming
p00285_B,00285,B,no of course not
p00286_B,00286,B,if even that worries you we could arrange something there s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease thanks to our money we might even go away for a little
p00287_B,00287,B,well i am going away frieda s just asked me to stettin and i shan t be back till after the new year will that do or must i fly the country altogether really meg what has come over you to make such a fuss
p00288_B,00288,B,oh i m getting an old maid i suppose i thought i minded nothing but really i i should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and you did go red you know when aunt juley attacked you this morning i shouldn t have referred to it otherwise
p00289_B,00289,B,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p00290_B,00290,B,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00291_B,00291,B,most certainly her love has died
p00292_B,00292,B,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p00293_B,00293,B,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p00294_B,00294,B,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p00295_B,00295,B,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini
p00296_B,00296,B,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her
p00297_B,00297,B,yes i know thanks very much
p00298_B,00298,B,i thought i did right to tell you
p00299_B,00299,B,ever so many thanks
p00300_B,00300,B,oh mrs wilcox i have made the baddest blunder i am more more ashamed and sorry than i can say i knew he was going to india in november but i forgot
p00301_B,00301,B,he sailed on the 17th for nigeria in africa
p00302_B,00302,B,i knew i know i have been too absurd all through i am very much ashamed i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me
p00303_B,00303,B,it doesn t matter miss schlegel it is good of you to have come round so promptly
p00304_B,00304,B,it does matter i have been rude to you and my sister is not even at home so there was not even that excuse
p00305_B,00305,B,she gone as well yes certainly it is quite safe safe absolutely now
p00306_B,00306,B,you ve been worrying too how perfectly extraordinary i can see that you have you felt as i do helen mustn t meet him again
p00307_B,00307,B,i did think it best
p00308_B,00308,B,now why
p00309_B,00309,B,that s a most difficult question i think you put it best in your letter it was an instinct which may be wrong
p00310_B,00310,B,it wasn t that your son still
p00311_B,00311,B,oh no he often my paul is very young you see
p00312_B,00312,B,then what was it
p00313_B,00313,B,an instinct which may be wrong
p00314_B,00314,B,in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn t live together that s dreadfully probable i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another
p00315_B,00315,B,these are indeed other words i had nothing so coherent in my head i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister
p00316_B,00316,B,ah i have always been wanting to ask you how did you know helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things did paul tell you
p00317_B,00317,B,there is nothing to be gained by discussing that
p00318_B,00318,B,mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it
p00319_B,00319,B,i was certainly against taking mrs matheson s flat i knew it was opposite your house
p00320_B,00320,B,but it s all right now
p00321_B,00321,B,i think so
p00322_B,00322,B,you only think you aren t sure i do love these little muddles tidied up
p00323_B,00323,B,oh yes i m sure i always sound uncertain over things it is my way of speaking
p00324_B,00324,B,that s all right and i m sure too i must say good bye now you will be getting up
p00325_B,00325,B,no please stop a little longer i am taking a day in bed now and then i do
p00326_B,00326,B,i thought of you as one of the early risers
p00327_B,00327,B,at howards end yes there is nothing to get up for in london
p00328_B,00328,B,nothing to get up for when there are all the autumn exhibitions and ysaye playing in the afternoon not to mention people
p00329_B,00329,B,the truth is i am a little tired first came the wedding and then paul went off and instead of resting yesterday i paid a round of calls
p00330_B,00330,B,a wedding
p00331_B,00331,B,yes charles my elder son is married
p00332_B,00332,B,are you quite certain that i m not interrupting mrs wilcox
p00333_B,00333,B,yes quite
p00334_B,00334,B,then i will stay i m enjoying this
p00335_B,00335,B,they have gone to naples for their honeymoon
p00336_B,00336,B,lucky people
p00337_B,00337,B,i can hardly imagine charles in italy
p00338_B,00338,B,doesn t he care for travelling
p00339_B,00339,B,he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable his father gave him a car for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end
p00340_B,00340,B,i suppose you have a garage there
p00341_B,00341,B,yes my husband built a little one only last month to the west of the house not far from the wych elm in what used to be the paddock for the pony
p00342_B,00342,B,where s the pony gone
p00343_B,00343,B,the pony oh dead ever so long ago
p00344_B,00344,B,the wych elm i remember helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree
p00345_B,00345,B,it is the finest wych elm in hertfordshire did your sister tell you about the teeth
p00346_B,00346,B,i should i love folklore and all festering superstitions
p00347_B,00347,B,do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it
p00348_B,00348,B,of course it did it would cure anything once
p00349_B,00349,B,certainly i remember cases you see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it i was born there good bye miss schlegel good bye thank you for coming you have cheered me up
p00350_B,00350,B,i m so glad
p00351_B,00351,B,i i wonder whether you ever think about yourself
p00352_B,00352,B,i think of nothing else
p00353_B,00353,B,i wonder i wondered at heidelberg
p00354_B,00354,B,i m sure
p00355_B,00355,B,i almost think
p00356_B,00356,B,i m twenty nine that s not so wildly girlish what makes you say that do you mean that i have been gauche and rude
p00357_B,00357,B,i only meant that i am fifty one and that to me both of you read it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly
p00358_B,00358,B,oh i ve got it inexperience i m no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her
p00359_B,00359,B,yes you have got it inexperience is the word
p00360_B,00360,B,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p00361_B,00361,B,indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself
p00362_B,00362,B,yes thank you i heard on tuesday only on tuesday for they live right away at stettin did you ever know any one living at stettin
p00363_B,00363,B,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p00364_B,00364,B,so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo
p00365_B,00365,B,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p00366_B,00366,B,they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously
p00367_B,00367,B,is anything gained by that
p00368_B,00368,B,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p00369_B,00369,B,i am not sure that i agree do you
p00370_B,00370,B,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p00371_B,00371,B,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p00372_B,00372,B,i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side
p00373_B,00373,B,the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side
p00374_B,00374,B,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p00375_B,00375,B,on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form
p00376_B,00376,B,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p00377_B,00377,B,then you ought to discussion keeps a house alive it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone
p00378_B,00378,B,it cannot stand without them it cannot stand without them and i sometimes think but i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here
p00379_B,00379,B,never mind us or her do say
p00380_B,00380,B,i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men
p00381_B,00381,B,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00382_B,00382,B,are they i never follow any arguments i am only too thankful not to have a vote myself
p00383_B,00383,B,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00384_B,00384,B,i don t know i don t know
p00385_B,00385,B,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00386_B,00386,B,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p00387_B,00387,B,what an interesting life you all lead in london
p00388_B,00388,B,no we don t we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys mrs wilcox really we have something quiet and stable at the bottom we really have all my friends have don t pretend you enjoyed lunch for you loathed it but forgive me by coming again alone or by asking me to you
p00389_B,00389,B,i am used to young people i hear a great deal of chatter at home for we like you entertain a great deal with us it is more sport and politics but i enjoyed my lunch very much miss schlegel dear and am not pretending and only wish i could have joined in more for one thing i m not particularly well just to day for another you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me charles is the same dolly the same but we are all in the same boat old and young i never forget that
p00390_B,00390,B,first of all we must make a list and tick off the people s names my aunt always does and this fog may thicken up any moment have you any ideas
p00391_B,00391,B,i thought we would go to harrods or the haymarket stores everything is sure to be there i am not a good shopper the din is so confusing and your aunt is quite right one ought to make a list take my notebook then and write your own name at the top of the page
p00392_B,00392,B,oh hooray how very kind of you to start with me i don t really want a yuletide gift though in fact i d rather not
p00393_B,00393,B,i should like to give you something worth your acquaintance miss schlegel in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight it has so happened that i have been left alone and you have stopped me from brooding i am too apt to brood
p00394_B,00394,B,if that is so if i have happened to be of use to you which i didn t know you cannot pay me back with anything tangible
p00395_B,00395,B,i suppose not but one would like to perhaps i shall think of something as we go about we always give the servants money
p00396_B,00396,B,yes do you yes much easier no i do like christmas on the whole in its clumsy way it does approach peace and goodwill but oh it is clumsier every year
p00397_B,00397,B,is it i am only used to country christmases
p00398_B,00398,B,we are usually in london and play the game with vigour carols at the abbey clumsy midday meal clumsy dinner for the maids followed by christmas tree and dancing of poor children with songs from helen the drawing room does very well for that we put the tree in the powder closet and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted and with the looking glass behind it looks quite pretty i wish we might have a powder closet in our next house of course the tree has to be very small and the presents don t hang on it no the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper
p00399_B,00399,B,you spoke of your next house miss schlegel then are you leaving wickham place
p00400_B,00400,B,yes in two or three years when the lease expires we must
p00401_B,00401,B,have you been there long
p00402_B,00402,B,all our lives
p00403_B,00403,B,you will be very sorry to leave it
p00404_B,00404,B,i suppose so we scarcely realise it yet my father
p00405_B,00405,B,if possible something distinctive
p00406_B,00406,B,bertha too oh fancy what a coincidence do you know i ll wait on second thoughts i ll wait there s plenty of time still isn t there and i shall be able to get evie s opinion
p00407_B,00407,B,i beg your pardon
p00408_B,00408,B,the lease i mean
p00409_B,00409,B,oh the lease have you been thinking of that all the time how very kind of you
p00410_B,00410,B,surely something could be done
p00411_B,00411,B,no values have risen too enormously they mean to pull down wickham place and build flats like yours
p00412_B,00412,B,but how horrible
p00413_B,00413,B,landlords are horrible
p00414_B,00414,B,it is monstrous miss schlegel it isn t right i had no idea that this was hanging over you i do pity you from the bottom of my heart to be parted from your house your father s house it oughtn t to be allowed it is worse than dying i would rather die than oh poor girls can what they call civilisation be right if people mayn t die in the room where they were born my dear i am so sorry howards end was nearly pulled down once it would have killed me
p00415_B,00415,B,i howards end must be a very different house to ours we are fond of ours but there is nothing distinctive about it as you saw it is an ordinary london house we shall easily find another
p00416_B,00416,B,so you think
p00417_B,00417,B,again my lack of experience i suppose i can t say anything when you take up that line mrs wilcox i wish i could see myself as you see me foreshortened into a backfisch quite the ingenue very charming wonderfully well read for my age but incapable
p00418_B,00418,B,come down with me to howards end now i want you to see it you have never seen it i want to hear what you say about it for you do put things so wonderfully
p00419_B,00419,B,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p00420_B,00420,B,back to wickham place please
p00421_B,00421,B,not at all
p00422_B,00422,B,it is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind the christmas cards especially i do admire your choice my husband and evie will be back the day after to morrow that is why i dragged you out shopping to day i stayed in town chiefly to shop but got through nothing and now he writes that they must cut their tour short the weather is so bad and the police traps have been so bad nearly as bad as in surrey ours is such a careful chauffeur and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road hogs
p00423_B,00423,B,he was exceeding the speed limit i conclude he must expect to suffer with the lower animals i will come if i still may
p00424_B,00424,B,you are coming to sleep dear too it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful you are coming to stop i cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise these fogs never spread far i dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire and you will never repent joining them
p00425_B,00425,B,i shall never repent joining you
p00426_B,00426,B,it is the same
p00427_B,00427,B,evie evie my pet
p00428_B,00428,B,father i say look who s here
p00429_B,00429,B,evie dearest girl why aren t you in yorkshire
p00430_B,00430,B,no motor smash changed plans father s coming
p00431_B,00431,B,oh henry dear here s a lovely surprise but let me introduce but i think you know miss schlegel
p00432_B,00432,B,oh yes but how s yourself ruth
p00433_B,00433,B,fit as a fiddle
p00434_B,00434,B,so are we and so was our car which ran a1 as far as ripon but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver
p00435_B,00435,B,miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
p00436_B,00436,B,i was saying that this fool of a driver as the policeman himself admits
p00437_B,00437,B,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00438_B,00438,B,but as we ve insured against third party risks it won t so much matter
p00439_B,00439,B,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00440_B,00440,B,henry why do people who have enough money try to get more money i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars a more inward light not so much for myself as for baby
p00441_B,00441,B,why didn t you tell me you knew of it
p00442_B,00442,B,i didn t want to henry i might have been wrong and every one hates illnesses
p00443_B,00443,B,thanks put it down
p00444_B,00444,B,has the breakfast been all right
p00445_B,00445,B,yes thanks
p00446_B,00446,B,charles says do you want the times
p00447_B,00447,B,no i ll read it later
p00448_B,00448,B,ring if you want anything father won t you
p00449_B,00449,B,i ve all i want
p00450_B,00450,B,father s eaten nothing
p00451_B,00451,B,look here father you must eat you know
p00452_B,00452,B,no indeed
p00453_B,00453,B,i must make a note of that i am surprised that the rector allowed it
p00454_B,00454,B,perhaps it may not be the rector s affair
p00455_B,00455,B,whose else could it be
p00456_B,00456,B,the lord of the manor
p00457_B,00457,B,thank you evie dear charles
p00458_B,00458,B,yes dear
p00459_B,00459,B,i didn t know one could pollard elms i thought one only pollarded willows
p00460_B,00460,B,oh no one can pollard elms
p00461_B,00461,B,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p00462_B,00462,B,another point i must speak to chalkeley
p00463_B,00463,B,yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
p00464_B,00464,B,it s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men he is responsible
p00465_B,00465,B,yes rather
p00466_B,00466,B,morning hullo my new car s been driven
p00467_B,00467,B,has it sir
p00468_B,00468,B,yes and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly for there s mud on the axle take it off
p00469_B,00469,B,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p00470_B,00470,B,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00471_B,00471,B,wait dear wait a minute who had the key of the garage while you were away crane
p00472_B,00472,B,the gardener sir
p00473_B,00473,B,do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor
p00474_B,00474,B,no sir no one s had the motor out sir
p00475_B,00475,B,then how do you account for the mud on the axle
p00476_B,00476,B,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p00477_B,00477,B,now dolly i can attend to you miss schlegel what does she want
p00478_B,00478,B,she wants howards end
p00479_B,00479,B,howards end now crane just don t forget to put on the stepney wheel
p00480_B,00480,B,no sir
p00481_B,00481,B,now mind you don t forget for i come little woman
p00482_B,00482,B,but you haven t listened charles
p00483_B,00483,B,what s wrong
p00484_B,00484,B,i keep on telling you howards end miss schlegel s got it
p00485_B,00485,B,got what what the dickens are you talking about
p00486_B,00486,B,now charles you promised not to say those naughty
p00487_B,00487,B,look here i m in no mood for foolery it s no morning for it either
p00488_B,00488,B,i tell you i keep on telling you miss schlegel she s got it your mother s left it to her and you ve all got to move out
p00489_B,00489,B,howards end
p00490_B,00490,B,howards end
p00491_B,00491,B,schlegels again
p00492_B,00492,B,oh no the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her
p00493_B,00493,B,oh mr wilcox
p00494_B,00494,B,i told you not to go out to the garage i ve heard you all shouting in the garden i won t have it come in into the dining room every one of you we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants here charles here read these see what you make
p00495_B,00495,B,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p00496_B,00496,B,certainly i was coming out to you when dolly
p00497_B,00497,B,well let s sit down
p00498_B,00498,B,come evie don t waste time sit down
p00499_B,00499,B,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p00500_B,00500,B,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p00501_B,00501,B,give it her
p00502_B,00502,B,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p00503_B,00503,B,we know that it is not legally binding dolly we are aware of that legally i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire of course my dear we consider you as one of the family but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand
p00504_B,00504,B,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p00505_B,00505,B,i don t think that
p00506_B,00506,B,don t think what
p00507_B,00507,B,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p00508_B,00508,B,my dear father consult an expert if you like but i don t admit it is my mother s writing
p00509_B,00509,B,why you just said it was
p00510_B,00510,B,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p00511_B,00511,B,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p00512_B,00512,B,mother couldn t have meant it
p00513_B,00513,B,no my girl of course not
p00514_B,00514,B,mother believed so in ancestors too it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider who d never appreciate
p00515_B,00515,B,the whole thing is unlike her if miss schlegel had been poor if she had wanted a house i could understand it a little but she has a house of her own why should she want another she wouldn t have any use for howards end
p00516_B,00516,B,that time may prove
p00517_B,00517,B,what a horrid woman
p00518_B,00518,B,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00519_B,00519,B,i wish she would i could then deal with her
p00520_B,00520,B,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p00521_B,00521,B,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p00522_B,00522,B,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p00523_B,00523,B,but those chrysanthemums
p00524_B,00524,B,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00525_B,00525,B,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00526_B,00526,B,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00527_B,00527,B,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out
p00528_B,00528,B,has he done it any harm
p00529_B,00529,B,and there will even be some one for tibby there now tibby think of that frieda is saving up a little girl for you in pig tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries i ve talked too much my head aches now you talk
p00530_B,00530,B,helen i told you about poor mrs wilcox that sad business
p00531_B,00531,B,i hope charles took the hint
p00532_B,00532,B,yes that is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette don t you think that is extraordinarily generous it has made me like him very much he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future i like mr wilcox he is taking up his work rubber it is a big business i gather he is launching out rather charles is in it too charles is married a pretty little creature but she doesn t seem wise they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own
p00533_B,00533,B,ye es
p00534_B,00534,B,but mr vyse is rather a wretched weedy man don t you think then there s guy that was a pitiful business besides every one is the better for some regular work i shall stick to it i am not saying it to educate you it is what i really think i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work and they must not starve it it s a new desire it goes with a great deal that s bad but in itself it s good and i hope that for women too not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago
p00535_B,00535,B,i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude
p00536_B,00536,B,then we ll leave the subject till you do i m not going to rattle you round take your time only do think over the lives of the men you like most and see how they ve arranged them
p00537_B,00537,B,i like guy and mr vyse most
p00538_B,00538,B,and don t think i m not serious because i don t use the traditional arguments making money a sphere awaiting you and so on all of which are for various reasons cant i m only your sister i haven t any authority over you and i don t want to have any just to put before you what i think the truth you see in a few years we shall be the same age practically and i shall want you to help me men are so much nicer than women
p00539_B,00539,B,labouring under such a delusion why do you not marry
p00540_B,00540,B,i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance
p00541_B,00541,B,has nobody arst you
p00542_B,00542,B,only ninnies
p00543_B,00543,B,do people ask helen
p00544_B,00544,B,they were men who had nothing better to do so take warning you must work or else you must pretend to work which is what i do work work work if you d save your soul and your body it is honestly a necessity dear boy look at the wilcoxes look at mr pembroke with all their defects of temper and understanding such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly
p00545_B,00545,B,spare me the wilcoxes
p00546_B,00546,B,i shall not they are the right sort
p00547_B,00547,B,oh goodness me meg
p00548_B,00548,B,well they re as near the right sort as you can imagine
p00549_B,00549,B,no no oh no
p00550_B,00550,B,i was thinking of the younger son whom i once classed as a ninny but who came back so ill from nigeria he s gone out there again evie wilcox tells me out to his duty he doesn t want the money it is work he wants though it is beastly work dull country dishonest natives an eternal fidget over fresh water and food a nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud no wonder england has become an empire
p00551_B,00551,B,what it is
p00552_B,00552,B,what it is worse luck i want activity without civilisation how paradoxical yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven
p00553_B,00553,B,and i want civilisation without activity which i expect is what we shall find in the other place
p00554_B,00554,B,you needn t go as far as the other place tibbikins if you want that you can find it at oxford
p00555_B,00555,B,london then
p00556_B,00556,B,i agree but helen rather wants to get away from london however there s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a flat in town provided we all stick together and contribute though of course oh how one does maunder on and to think to think of the people who are really poor how do they live not to move about the world would kill me
p00557_B,00557,B,not anything to do with bracknell
p00558_B,00558,B,i offered bracknell and he was rejected so was tibby cheer up tibby it s no one we know i said oh and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier
p00559_B,00559,B,now helen what did really happen
p00560_B,00560,B,what i say i was as it were orating my speech annie opens the door like a fool and shows a female straight in on me with my mouth open then we began very civilly no how unjust one is she said whom not what she got it perfectly so i said and she said and there we were
p00561_B,00561,B,but what an extraordinary
p00562_B,00562,B,i said my good mrs lanoline we have some grave misunderstanding here beautiful as i am my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty and never never has mr lanoline rested his eyes on mine
p00563_B,00563,B,i hope you were pleased
p00564_B,00564,B,of course a perfectly delightful experience oh mrs lanoline s a dear she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella she mislaid him saturday afternoon and for a long time suffered no inconvenience but all night and all this morning her apprehensions grew breakfast didn t seem the same no no more did lunch and so she strolled up to 2 wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article
p00565_B,00565,B,but how on earth
p00566_B,00566,B,don t begin how on earthing she kept repeating not uncivilly but with extreme gloom in vain i asked her what she did know some knew what others knew and others didn t and then others again had better be careful oh dear she was incompetent she had a face like a silkworm and the dining room reeks of orris root we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands and i wondered where hers was too and advised her to go to the police she thanked me we agreed that mr lanoline s a notty notty man and hasn t no business to go on the lardy da but i think she suspected me up to the last bags i writing to aunt juley about this now meg remember bags i
p00567_B,00567,B,bag it by all means i m not sure that this is so funny helen it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere doesn t it
p00568_B,00568,B,i don t think so she doesn t really mind the admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy
p00569_B,00569,B,her husband may be though
p00570_B,00570,B,oh no not likely no one capable of tragedy could have married mrs lanoline
p00571_B,00571,B,was she pretty
p00572_B,00572,B,her figure may have been good once
p00573_B,00573,B,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september
p00574_B,00574,B,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do cheers children it s mrs lanoline
p00575_B,00575,B,no i can t say i do
p00576_B,00576,B,well that was how it happened you see
p00577_B,00577,B,where did we meet mr bast for the minute i don t remember
p00578_B,00578,B,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p00579_B,00579,B,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p00580_B,00580,B,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p00581_B,00581,B,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p00582_B,00582,B,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p00583_B,00583,B,yes thank you miss schlegel
p00584_B,00584,B,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p00585_B,00585,B,yes the mistake arose it was a mistake
p00586_B,00586,B,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p00587_B,00587,B,that s so calling too a mistake
p00588_B,00588,B,then why
p00589_B,00589,B,i said to my wife i said to mrs bast and mrs bast said to me while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you
p00590_B,00590,B,no inconvenience but i still don t understand i still don t understand when did you say you paid this call
p00591_B,00591,B,call what call
p00592_B,00592,B,this afternoon call
p00593_B,00593,B,in the afternoon of course
p00594_B,00594,B,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00595_B,00595,B,s saturday
p00596_B,00596,B,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00597_B,00597,B,i don t call that fair i know what you mean and it isn t so
p00598_B,00598,B,oh don t let us mind
p00599_B,00599,B,it was something else i was somewhere else to what you think so there
p00600_B,00600,B,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p00601_B,00601,B,yes but i want i wanted have you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel it s a beautiful book i wanted to get back to the earth don t you see like richard does in the end or have you ever read stevenson s prince otto that s another beautiful book you get back to the earth in that i wanted i walked all the saturday night i walked
p00602_B,00602,B,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p00603_B,00603,B,oh i walked
p00604_B,00604,B,how far
p00605_B,00605,B,i don t know nor for how long it got too dark to see my watch
p00606_B,00606,B,were you walking alone may i ask
p00607_B,00607,B,yes but we d been talking it over at the office there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed
p00608_B,00608,B,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p00609_B,00609,B,well i lost it entirely first of all the street lamps then the trees and towards morning it got cloudy
p00610_B,00610,B,where did you start from do tell us more
p00611_B,00611,B,i took the underground to wimbledon as i came out of the office i said to myself i must have a walk once in a way if i don t take this walk now i shall never take it i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon and then
p00612_B,00612,B,but not good country there is it
p00613_B,00613,B,it was gas lamps for hours still i had all the night and being out was the great thing i did get into woods too presently
p00614_B,00614,B,yes go on
p00615_B,00615,B,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark
p00616_B,00616,B,did you actually go off the roads
p00617_B,00617,B,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p00618_B,00618,B,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00619_B,00619,B,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on
p00620_B,00620,B,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p00621_B,00621,B,yes but the wood this ere wood how did you get out of it
p00622_B,00622,B,i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood that was awful with gorse bushes i did wish i d never come but suddenly it got light just while i seemed going under one tree then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london
p00623_B,00623,B,but was the dawn wonderful
p00624_B,00624,B,no the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention
p00625_B,00625,B,just a grey evening turned upside down i know
p00626_B,00626,B,and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too i m glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say and besides you can believe me or not as you choose i was very hungry that dinner at wimbledon i meant it to last me all night like other dinners i never thought that walking would make such a difference why when you re walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines lord i did feel bad looking back it wasn t what you may call enjoyment it was more a case of sticking to it i did stick i i was determined oh hang it all what s the good i mean the good of living in a room for ever there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside if it s only nothing particular after all
p00627_B,00627,B,i should just think you ought
p00628_B,00628,B,curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies
p00629_B,00629,B,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p00630_B,00630,B,then you don t think i was foolish
p00631_B,00631,B,heavens no
p00632_B,00632,B,heaven help us if we do
p00633_B,00633,B,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00634_B,00634,B,no it wasn t foolish you ve pushed back the boundaries i think it splendid of you
p00635_B,00635,B,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p00636_B,00636,B,though we have walked too
p00637_B,00637,B,i must show you a picture upstairs
p00638_B,00638,B,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p00639_B,00639,B,yes you must do
p00640_B,00640,B,no i shall not it s better like this
p00641_B,00641,B,why better
p00642_B,00642,B,no it is better not to risk a second interview i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life really i mean this we can never repeat it has done me real good and there we had better leave it
p00643_B,00643,B,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p00644_B,00644,B,things so often get spoiled
p00645_B,00645,B,i know but people don t go then perhaps you know best but never forget you re better than jefferies
p00646_B,00646,B,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p00647_B,00647,B,len who s miss schlegel
p00648_B,00648,B,well at all events she doesn t know about that card yah done her there
p00649_B,00649,B,len i do think you might explain
p00650_B,00650,B,your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument why not give him the money itself you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year
p00651_B,00651,B,have i i thought i had a million
p00652_B,00652,B,wasn t a million your capital dear me we ought to have settled that still it doesn t matter whatever you ve got i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each
p00653_B,00653,B,but that would be pauperising them
p00654_B,00654,B,not if you gave them so much a big windfall would not pauperise a man it is these little driblets distributed among too many that do the harm money s educational it s far more educational than the things it buys in a sense well isn t the most civilized thing going the man who has learnt to wear his income properly give them a chance give them money don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies give them the wherewithal to buy these things when your socialism comes it may be different and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash till it comes give people cash for it is the warp of civilisation whatever the woof may be the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly for it s the the second most important thing in the world it is so slurred over and hushed up there is so little clear thinking oh political economy of course but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means money give mr bast money and don t bother about his ideals he ll pick up those for himself nothing but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world
p00655_B,00655,B,personal supervision and mutual help
p00656_B,00656,B,i say helen
p00657_B,00657,B,i don t know
p00658_B,00658,B,i think we won t
p00659_B,00659,B,as you like
p00660_B,00660,B,it s no good i think unless you really mean to know people the discussion brought that home to me we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse we mustn t play at friendship no it s no good
p00661_B,00661,B,there s mrs lanoline too so dull
p00662_B,00662,B,just so and possibly worse than dull
p00663_B,00663,B,i should like to know how he got hold of your card
p00664_B,00664,B,but he said something about a concert and an umbrella
p00665_B,00665,B,then did the card see the wife
p00666_B,00666,B,helen come to bed
p00667_B,00667,B,no just a little longer it is so beautiful tell me oh yes did you say money is the warp of the world
p00668_B,00668,B,very much what one chooses it s something that isn t money one can t say more
p00669_B,00669,B,walking at night
p00670_B,00670,B,it seems so
p00671_B,00671,B,for you
p00672_B,00672,B,now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it s that for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people
p00673_B,00673,B,why meg they re so much nicer generally i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it
p00674_B,00674,B,i believe we shall come to care about people less and less helen the more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them it s one of the curses of london i quite expect to end my life caring most for a place
p00675_B,00675,B,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son
p00676_B,00676,B,paul oh paul s all right we had a line from madeira he ll be at work again by now
p00677_B,00677,B,isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible
p00678_B,00678,B,some one s got to go england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices unless we get firm in west africa ger untold complications may follow now tell me all your news
p00679_B,00679,B,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p00680_B,00680,B,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p00681_B,00681,B,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00682_B,00682,B,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p00683_B,00683,B,not at all i don t agree with your sister there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster it would have helped me no end
p00684_B,00684,B,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
p00685_B,00685,B,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p00686_B,00686,B,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p00687_B,00687,B,but mr wilcox do first light another cigarette it s this we ve just come across a young fellow who s evidently very poor and who seems interest
p00688_B,00688,B,what s his profession
p00689_B,00689,B,do you remember margaret
p00690_B,00690,B,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00691_B,00691,B,oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chance but he is so poor he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink well he got mixed up in our debate he wasn t the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man how should he be helped should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret s plan most of them thought this would pauperise him should he and those like him be given free libraries i said no he doesn t want more books to read but to read books rightly my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too nothing seemed quite right now what do you think imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor what would you do
p00692_B,00692,B,my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed
p00693_B,00693,B,dear me helen listen to that and he ll have to get another place
p00694_B,00694,B,will have let him leave the ship before it sinks let him get one now
p00695_B,00695,B,rather than wait to make sure
p00696_B,00696,B,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p00697_B,00697,B,i hadn t thought of that
p00698_B,00698,B,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00699_B,00699,B,and how does he clean the boots
p00700_B,00700,B,not well
p00701_B,00701,B,there you are
p00702_B,00702,B,then do you really advise us to tell this youth
p00703_B,00703,B,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p00704_B,00704,B,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p00705_B,00705,B,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p00706_B,00706,B,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p00707_B,00707,B,human nature i suppose
p00708_B,00708,B,yes extremely
p00709_B,00709,B,and how s howards end looking
p00710_B,00710,B,it s let
p00711_B,00711,B,really and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea how strange are the ways of fate
p00712_B,00712,B,no it s let unfurnished we ve moved
p00713_B,00713,B,why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever evie never told me
p00714_B,00714,B,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled we only moved a week ago paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small endless drawbacks i forget whether you ve been up to it
p00715_B,00715,B,as far as the house never
p00716_B,00716,B,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales
p00717_B,00717,B,what a change i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you
p00718_B,00718,B,hilton isn t without us charles is there still
p00719_B,00719,B,still but i thought he was still at epsom they were furnishing that christmas one christmas how everything alters i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often wasn t it epsom
p00720_B,00720,B,yes but they moved eighteen months ago charles the good chap thought i should be lonely i didn t want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills he had a motor too there they all are a very jolly party he and she and the two grandchildren
p00721_B,00721,B,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family
p00722_B,00722,B,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to
p00723_B,00723,B,no but none of you are there
p00724_B,00724,B,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other
p00725_B,00725,B,and some people are lucky enough to have both you re doing yourself proud mr wilcox my congratulations
p00726_B,00726,B,and mine
p00727_B,00727,B,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either
p00728_B,00728,B,you too on the move
p00729_B,00729,B,next september
p00730_B,00730,B,every one moving good bye
p00731_B,00731,B,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p00732_B,00732,B,do yes that s worth doing let us
p00733_B,00733,B,the more a lady has to say the better

p00740_B,00740,B,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p00741_B,00741,B,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00742_B,00742,B,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p00743_B,00743,B,it depends on what you call big
p00744_B,00744,B,i mean by big a solid well established concern that offers a reasonably good career to its employes
p00745_B,00745,B,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p00746_B,00746,B,i quite agree and that s why i was curious to know is it a solid well established concern
p00747_B,00747,B,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00748_B,00748,B,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured
p00749_B,00749,B,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p00750_B,00750,B,oh good
p00751_B,00751,B,wrong so to speak
p00752_B,00752,B,how so to speak
p00753_B,00753,B,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p00754_B,00754,B,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p00755_B,00755,B,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00756_B,00756,B,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00757_B,00757,B,so you like carlyle
p00758_B,00758,B,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00759_B,00759,B,we brought the little fellows round

p00766_B,00766,B,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p00767_B,00767,B,come again
p00768_B,00768,B,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p00769_B,00769,B,i call that a very rude remark what do you want to turn on me like that for
p00770_B,00770,B,you ask me why i turn on you
p00771_B,00771,B,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p00772_B,00772,B,i don t want your patronage i don t want your tea i was quite happy what do you want to unsettle me for i put it to this gentleman i ask you sir am i to have my brain picked
p00773_B,00773,B,are we intruding miss schlegel can we be of any use or shall we go
p00774_B,00774,B,i m connected with a leading insurance company sir i receive what i take to be an invitation from these ladies i come and it s to have my brain picked i ask you is it fair
p00775_B,00775,B,highly unfair
p00776_B,00776,B,there you hear that most unfair the gentleman says there not content with you can t deny it but as soon as i m useful it s a very different thing oh yes send for him cross question him pick his brains oh yes now take me on the whole i m a quiet fellow i m law abiding i don t wish any unpleasantness but i i
p00777_B,00777,B,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p00778_B,00778,B,i fail to see the connection
p00779_B,00779,B,so do i you were that last sunday you are this to day mr bast i and my sister have talked you over we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us we did not have you here out of charity which bores us but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives they have never entered into mine but into yours we thought haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some place some beloved place or tree we thought you one of these
p00780_B,00780,B,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p00781_B,00781,B,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p00782_B,00782,B,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p00783_B,00783,B,but really ought she to
p00784_B,00784,B,oh yes
p00785_B,00785,B,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p00786_B,00786,B,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p00787_B,00787,B,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p00788_B,00788,B,oh i didn t mind oughtn t you really to be more careful
p00789_B,00789,B,do you realise that it s all your fault you re responsible
p00790_B,00790,B,i hardly consider that a fair deduction
p00791_B,00791,B,obviously unfair i was only thinking how tangled things are it s our fault mostly neither yours nor his
p00792_B,00792,B,not his
p00793_B,00793,B,yes indeed
p00794_B,00794,B,you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly you must keep that type at a distance otherwise they forget themselves sad but true they aren t our sort and one must face the fact
p00795_B,00795,B,ye es
p00796_B,00796,B,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman
p00797_B,00797,B,i admit it willingly a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself
p00798_B,00798,B,what did he suspect you of
p00799_B,00799,B,of wanting to make money out of him
p00800_B,00800,B,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit
p00801_B,00801,B,exactly how indeed just horrible corroding suspicion one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes
p00802_B,00802,B,i come back to my original point you ought to be more careful miss schlegel your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in
p00803_B,00803,B,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again
p00804_B,00804,B,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him
p00805_B,00805,B,i do firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out secondly he cares for something special in adventure it is quickest to call that special something poetry
p00806_B,00806,B,oh he s one of that writer sort
p00807_B,00807,B,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both
p00808_B,00808,B,your mistake is this and it is a very common mistake this young bounder has a life of his own what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life or as you call it grey
p00809_B,00809,B,his wife is an old bore he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us
p00810_B,00810,B,with you
p00811_B,00811,B,yes he hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed he needs outside interests
p00812_B,00812,B,naughty young man
p00813_B,00813,B,naughty when you re married miss wilcox won t you want outside interests
p00814_B,00814,B,he has apparently got them
p00815_B,00815,B,yes indeed father
p00816_B,00816,B,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that
p00817_B,00817,B,oh i dare say
p00818_B,00818,B,miss wilcox he was
p00819_B,00819,B,m m m m
p00820_B,00820,B,he said so and about such a thing he wouldn t lie that s where i differ from you men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort
p00821_B,00821,B,miss schlegel excuse me but i know the type
p00822_B,00822,B,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man
p00823_B,00823,B,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say
p00824_B,00824,B,i forget
p00825_B,00825,B,surely he has some opinion
p00826_B,00826,B,he laughs if i remember correctly
p00827_B,00827,B,he s very clever isn t he
p00828_B,00828,B,yes pretty well but i wonder what helen s doing
p00829_B,00829,B,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing
p00830_B,00830,B,yes he s gone some time
p00831_B,00831,B,why you re all alone
p00832_B,00832,B,yes it s all right meg poor poor creature
p00833_B,00833,B,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later mr w much concerned and slightly titillated
p00834_B,00834,B,oh i ve no patience with him i hate him poor dear mr bast he wanted to talk literature and we would talk business such a muddle of a man and yet so worth pulling through i like him extraordinarily
p00835_B,00835,B,well done but come into the drawing room now and don t talk about him to the wilcoxes make light of the whole thing
p00836_B,00836,B,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p00837_B,00837,B,i am really concerned at the way those girls go on they are as clever as you make em but unpractical god bless me one of these days they ll go too far girls like that oughtn t to live alone in london until they marry they ought to have some one to look after them we must look in more often we re better than no one you like them don t you evie
p00838_B,00838,B,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls
p00839_B,00839,B,no after houses i m hungry not tired i want to eat heaps
p00840_B,00840,B,that s good what ll you have
p00841_B,00841,B,fish pie
p00842_B,00842,B,fish pie fancy coming for fish pie to simpson s it s not a bit the thing to go for here
p00843_B,00843,B,go for something for me then
p00844_B,00844,B,saddle of mutton and cider to drink that s the type of thing i like this place for a joke once in a way it is so thoroughly old english don t you agree
p00845_B,00845,B,perhaps it does make life more human
p00846_B,00846,B,then the fellows know one again especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year s end to year s end
p00847_B,00847,B,have you been in the east
p00848_B,00848,B,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately
p00849_B,00849,B,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses
p00850_B,00850,B,afraid i don t
p00851_B,00851,B,well what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them
p00852_B,00852,B,evie i like that miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
p00853_B,00853,B,what s that father
p00854_B,00854,B,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p00855_B,00855,B,percy do you know of anything
p00856_B,00856,B,i can t say i do
p00857_B,00857,B,how like you you re never any good
p00858_B,00858,B,never any good just listen to her never any good oh come
p00859_B,00859,B,well you aren t miss schlegel is he
p00860_B,00860,B,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s
p00861_B,00861,B,with pleasure
p00862_B,00862,B,no you d hate it it s all proteids and body buildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura
p00863_B,00863,B,a what
p00864_B,00864,B,never heard of an aura oh happy happy man i scrub at mine for hours nor of an astral plane just so luckily it was helen s aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went
p00865_B,00865,B,funny experiences seem to come to you two girls no one s ever asked me about my what d ye call it perhaps i ve not got one
p00866_B,00866,B,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it
p00867_B,00867,B,tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that
p00868_B,00868,B,too difficult a question
p00869_B,00869,B,why s that gruyere or stilton
p00870_B,00870,B,gruyere please
p00871_B,00871,B,better have stilton
p00872_B,00872,B,stilton because though i don t believe in auras and think theosophy s only a halfway house
p00873_B,00873,B,yet there may be something in it all the same
p00874_B,00874,B,not even that it may be halfway in the wrong direction i can t explain i don t believe in all these fads and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them
p00875_B,00875,B,so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it
p00876_B,00876,B,i could indeed i will when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny but why do you want this settled
p00877_B,00877,B,i don t know
p00878_B,00878,B,now mr wilcox you do know how s your house
p00879_B,00879,B,much the same as when you honoured it last week
p00880_B,00880,B,i don t mean ducie street howards end of course
p00881_B,00881,B,why of course
p00882_B,00882,B,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us we re nearly demented
p00883_B,00883,B,let me think i wish i could help you but i thought you wanted to be in town one bit of advice fix your district then fix your price and then don t budge that s how i got both ducie street and oniton i said to myself i mean to be exactly here and i was and oniton s a place in a thousand
p00884_B,00884,B,but i do budge gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses cow them with an eye and up they come trembling ladies can t it s the houses that are mesmerising me i ve no control over the saucy things houses are alive no
p00885_B,00885,B,i m out of my depth didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy
p00886_B,00886,B,did i i mean i did more or less i talk the same way to every one or try to
p00887_B,00887,B,yes i know and how much of it do you suppose he understood
p00888_B,00888,B,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice
p00889_B,00889,B,lower classes well you do admit that there are rich and poor that s something you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same the hard working man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom
p00890_B,00890,B,every one admits that
p00891_B,00891,B,your socialists don t
p00892_B,00892,B,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily
p00893_B,00893,B,i don t care you ve made two damaging admissions and i m heartily with you in both
p00894_B,00894,B,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p00895_B,00895,B,no we have no real ties
p00896_B,00896,B,shan t i go up to town to day take the house if it s the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow and start enjoying myself i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind
p00897_B,00897,B,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00898_B,00898,B,there s nothing rash to do
p00899_B,00899,B,who are the wilcoxes
p00900_B,00900,B,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00901_B,00901,B,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p00902_B,00902,B,interesting people don t get one houses
p00903_B,00903,B,meg if you start in your honest english vein i shall throw the treacle at you
p00904_B,00904,B,it s a better vein than the cosmopolitan now children which is it to be you know the ducie street house shall i say yes or shall i say no tibby love which i m specially anxious to pin you both it depends on nothing of the sort say yes i think that our race is degenerating we cannot settle even this little thing what will it be like when we have to settle a big one
p00905_B,00905,B,it will be as easy as eating
p00906_B,00906,B,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p00907_B,00907,B,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p00908_B,00908,B,i knew it i told you so it is the little things one bungles at the big real ones are nothing when they come
p00909_B,00909,B,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p00910_B,00910,B,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p00911_B,00911,B,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00912_B,00912,B,helen may be right
p00913_B,00913,B,of course she s right
p00914_B,00914,B,this is awfully kind of you but i m afraid it s not going to do the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family
p00915_B,00915,B,what have you come up determined not to deal
p00916_B,00916,B,not exactly
p00917_B,00917,B,not exactly in that case let s be starting
p00918_B,00918,B,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane
p00919_B,00919,B,come let s be starting how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane
p00920_B,00920,B,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things
p00921_B,00921,B,evie you won t see her she s gone out with cahill it s no fun i can tell you being left so much alone i ve got my work all day indeed a great deal too much of it but when i come home in the evening i tell you i can t stand the house
p00922_B,00922,B,in my absurd way i m lonely too it s heart breaking to leave one s old home i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there helen says
p00923_B,00923,B,you too feel lonely
p00924_B,00924,B,horribly hullo parliament s back
p00925_B,00925,B,yes they are talking again but you were going to say
p00926_B,00926,B,only some rubbish about furniture helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas just imagine it rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them
p00927_B,00927,B,your sister always likes her little joke
p00928_B,00928,B,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you
p00929_B,00929,B,you are not as unpractical as you pretend i shall never believe it at all events you responded to my telegram promptly
p00930_B,00930,B,oh even i know a good thing when i see it
p00931_B,00931,B,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world
p00932_B,00932,B,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that
p00933_B,00933,B,i am glad very glad there is so much cant talked in would be intellectual circles i am glad you don t share it self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character but i can t stand those people who run down comforts they have usually some axe to grind can you
p00934_B,00934,B,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends
p00935_B,00935,B,i mean reasonable comforts of course i shouldn t like to think that you
p00936_B,00936,B,i want to go over the whole house as soon as i get back to swanage which will be to morrow afternoon i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby and wire you yes or no
p00937_B,00937,B,right the dining room now the entrance hall here we fellows smoke
p00938_B,00938,B,oh jolly
p00939_B,00939,B,you do like it it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable isn t it
p00940_B,00940,B,ye es semi rubbish are those cruikshanks
p00941_B,00941,B,gillrays shall we go on upstairs
p00942_B,00942,B,does all this furniture come from howards end
p00943_B,00943,B,the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton
p00944_B,00944,B,does however i m concerned with the house not the furniture how big is this smoking room
p00945_B,00945,B,thirty by fifteen no wait a minute fifteen and a half
p00946_B,00946,B,ah well mr wilcox aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses
p00947_B,00947,B,miss schlegel i have had you up on false pretences i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house could you be induced to share my is it probable
p00948_B,00948,B,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may
p00949_B,00949,B,miss schlegel margaret you don t understand
p00950_B,00950,B,oh yes indeed yes
p00951_B,00951,B,i am asking you to be my wife you aren t offended miss schlegel
p00952_B,00952,B,how could i be offended good bye you will have a letter from me i am going back to swanage to morrow
p00953_B,00953,B,thank you
p00954_B,00954,B,good bye and it s you i thank
p00955_B,00955,B,i may order the motor round mayn t i
p00956_B,00956,B,that would be most kind
p00957_B,00957,B,i wish i had written ought i to have written
p00958_B,00958,B,not at all
p00959_B,00959,B,there s just one question
p00960_B,00960,B,no frau liesecke but that is because they are fresh water and different salt water ought to have tides and go up and down a great deal or else it smells look for instance at an aquarium
p00961_B,00961,B,an aquarium oh meesis munt you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt why then victor my brother in law collected many tadpoles
p00962_B,00962,B,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00963_B,00963,B,then smell and the mud of your pool down there does it not smell or may i say stink ha ha
p00964_B,00964,B,there always has been mud in poole harbour the rivers bring it down and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it
p00965_B,00965,B,yes that is so
p00966_B,00966,B,bournemouth is bournemouth is poole was and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three now frau liesecke i have shown you bournemouth and i have shown you poole so let us walk backward a little and look down again at swanage
p00967_B,00967,B,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train
p00968_B,00968,B,oh dearest margaret i do hope she won t be overtired
p00969_B,00969,B,oh i do wonder i do wonder whether she s taken the house
p00970_B,00970,B,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p00971_B,00971,B,so do i oh so do i
p00972_B,00972,B,will it be as beautiful as wickham place
p00973_B,00973,B,i should think it would trust mr wilcox for doing himself proud all those ducie street houses are beautiful in their modern way and i can t think why he doesn t keep on with it but it s really for evie that he went there and now that evie s going to be married
p00974_B,00974,B,but sister to that paul
p00975_B,00975,B,meg and i haven t got such tender hearts if there s a chance of a cheap house we go for it
p00976_B,00976,B,now look frau liesecke at my niece s train you see it is coming towards us coming coming and when it gets to corfe it will actually go through the downs on which we are standing so that if we walk over as i suggested and look down on swanage we shall see it coming on the other side shall we
p00977_B,00977,B,you see the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles they have one ducie street two howards end where my great rumpus was three a country seat in shropshire four charles has a house in hilton and five another near epsom and six evie will have a house when she marries and probably a pied a terre in the country which makes seven oh yes and paul a hut in africa makes eight i wish we could get howards end that was something like a dear little house didn t you think so aunt juley
p00978_B,00978,B,i had too much to do dear to look at it i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides it isn t likely i should remember much i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
p00979_B,00979,B,yes so do i but oh dear dear how dreadful it all seems and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement you and frieda and meg and mrs wilcox all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul
p00980_B,00980,B,you yet may
p00981_B,00981,B,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that
p00982_B,00982,B,one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions
p00983_B,00983,B,look stand where i stand and you will see the pony cart coming i see the pony cart coming
p00984_B,00984,B,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p00985_B,00985,B,not exactly
p00986_B,00986,B,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00987_B,00987,B,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you
p00988_B,00988,B,wait one minute
p00989_B,00989,B,but you ve never conceivably you ve never
p00990_B,00990,B,oh really
p00991_B,00991,B,don t don t don t meg don t don t don t do such a thing i tell you not to don t i know don t
p00992_B,00992,B,what do you know
p00993_B,00993,B,panic and emptiness don t
p00994_B,00994,B,helen is a little selfish i have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying
p00995_B,00995,B,it s not a thing like that
p00996_B,00996,B,what s happened to you
p00997_B,00997,B,but it s stupid
p00998_B,00998,B,i don t know what s happened to either of us we must both have gone mad look here sit down
p00999_B,00999,B,all right i ll sit down if you ll sit down
p01000_B,01000,B,there now whatever whatever is the matter
p01001_B,01001,B,i do mean what i said don t it wouldn t do
p01002_B,01002,B,oh helen stop saying don t it s ignorant it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime don t is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr bast well
p01003_B,01003,B,tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime
p01004_B,01004,B,that s better well where shall i begin when i arrived at waterloo no i ll go back before that because i m anxious you should know everything from the first the first was about ten days ago it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can t help any more than we can you know at least i know in my own case when a man has said to me so and so s a pretty girl i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so and long to tweak her ear it s a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it but it wasn t only this in mr wilcox s case i gather now
p01005_B,01005,B,then you love him
p01006_B,01006,B,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years
p01007_B,01007,B,but loved him
p01008_B,01008,B,yes of that i m pretty sure indeed i began the moment he spoke to me
p01009_B,01009,B,and have settled to marry him
p01010_B,01010,B,i had but am wanting a long talk about it now what is it against him helen you must try and say
p01011_B,01011,B,it is ever since paul
p01012_B,01012,B,but what has mr wilcox to do with paul
p01013_B,01013,B,but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger
p01014_B,01014,B,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you
p01015_B,01015,B,no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad
p01016_B,01016,B,i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me
p01017_B,01017,B,and to me and to all women so one kissed paul
p01018_B,01018,B,that s brutal mine is an absolutely different case i ve thought things out
p01019_B,01019,B,it makes no difference thinking things out they come to the same
p01020_B,01020,B,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago
p01021_B,01021,B,yes and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme ah well
p01022_B,01022,B,i little thought then certainly did you
p01023_B,01023,B,i don t know about that i shouldn t like to say
p01024_B,01024,B,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal
p01025_B,01025,B,by the way
p01026_B,01026,B,a suggestion a seed
p01027_B,01027,B,i was thinking if you didn t mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle
p01028_B,01028,B,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby
p01029_B,01029,B,with your brother
p01030_B,01030,B,yes during cigarettes
p01031_B,01031,B,oh very well
p01032_B,01032,B,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably
p01033_B,01033,B,about greece too
p01034_B,01034,B,greece was a very good card henry tibby s only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little well done
p01035_B,01035,B,i was telling him i have shares in a currant farm near calamata
p01036_B,01036,B,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon
p01037_B,01037,B,what to do
p01038_B,01038,B,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery
p01039_B,01039,B,moderately but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady
p01040_B,01040,B,why not
p01041_B,01041,B,no hotels
p01042_B,01042,B,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs
p01043_B,01043,B,i wasn t aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again
p01044_B,01044,B,you haven t found time for a talk with helen yet i suppose
p01045_B,01045,B,your sister and i have always hit it off but we re drifting away from our business let me begin at the beginning you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill
p01046_B,01046,B,dolly s uncle
p01047_B,01047,B,exactly the girl s madly in love with him a very good sort of fellow but he demands and rightly a suitable provision with her and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development
p01048_B,01048,B,poor fellow
p01049_B,01049,B,charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others
p01050_B,01050,B,of course not you mean money how stupid i am of course not
p01051_B,01051,B,yes money since you put it so frankly i am determined to be just to all just to you just to them i am determined that my children shall have me
p01052_B,01052,B,be generous to them bother justice
p01053_B,01053,B,i am determined and have already written to charles to that effect
p01054_B,01054,B,but how much have you got
p01055_B,01055,B,my income
p01056_B,01056,B,yes we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles justice and even generosity depend on that
p01057_B,01057,B,i must say you re a downright young woman what a question to spring on a fellow
p01058_B,01058,B,don t you know your income or don t you want to tell it me
p01059_B,01059,B,the fact is my dear i hadn t any intention of bothering you with details i only wanted to let you know that well that something must be done for the others and you ve understood me perfectly so let s pass on to the next point
p01060_B,01060,B,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one
p01061_B,01061,B,we ve none too much i assure you you re marrying a poor man
p01062_B,01062,B,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world
p01063_B,01063,B,there s this other point and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters what s to be done now about the house in ducie street
p01064_B,01064,B,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me
p01065_B,01065,B,i say take care i don t report you to the police evie will probably be married in september we could scarcely think of anything before then
p01066_B,01066,B,the earlier the nicer henry females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer
p01067_B,01067,B,how about september for us too
p01068_B,01068,B,right shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it that s rather an idea they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management look here yes we ll do that and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire
p01069_B,01069,B,heavens how you women do fly round my head s in a whirl point by point margaret howards end s impossible i let it to hamar bryce on a three years agreement last march don t you remember oniton well that is much much too far away to rely on entirely you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount but we must have a house within easy reach of town only ducie street has huge drawbacks there s a mews behind yes in summer especially the mews is a serious nuisance the smoking room too is an abominable little den the house opposite has been taken by operatic people ducie street s going down it s my private opinion
p01070_B,01070,B,how sad it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses
p01071_B,01071,B,shows things are moving good for trade
p01072_B,01072,B,i hate this continual flux of london it is an epitome of us at our worst eternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming away streaming streaming for ever that s why i dread it so i mistrust rivers even in scenery now the sea
p01073_B,01073,B,high tide yes and these are the men to whom we give the vote however they have their own lives and interests let s get on a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone
p01074_B,01074,B,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment
p01075_B,01075,B,it isn t meant as a compliment my dear i just won t have you going about in the dark such people about too it s dangerous
p01076_B,01076,B,can t i look after myself i do wish
p01077_B,01077,B,come along margaret no wheedling margaret
p01078_B,01078,B,who asked him while i was away who asked my sister down to meet him who sent them out in the motor day after day
p01079_B,01079,B,charles that reminds me of some poem
p01080_B,01080,B,does it indeed we shall all be dancing to a very different music presently miss schlegel has fairly got us on toast
p01081_B,01081,B,i could simply scratch that woman s eyes out and to say it s my fault is most unfair
p01082_B,01082,B,it s your fault and five months ago you admitted it
p01083_B,01083,B,i didn t
p01084_B,01084,B,you did
p01085_B,01085,B,tootle tootle playing on the pootle
p01086_B,01086,B,it s all very well to turn the conversation but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable but you must needs start match making besides cahill s too old
p01087_B,01087,B,of course if you re going to be rude to uncle percy
p01088_B,01088,B,miss schlegel always meant to get hold of howards end and thanks to you she s got it
p01089_B,01089,B,i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair you couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting could he diddums
p01090_B,01090,B,we re in a bad hole and must make the best of it i shall answer the pater s letter civilly he s evidently anxious to do the decent thing but i do not intend to forget these schlegels in a hurry as long as they re on their best behaviour dolly are you listening we ll behave too but if i find them giving themselves airs or monopolising my father or at all ill treating him or worrying him with their artistic beastliness i intend to put my foot down yes firmly taking my mother s place heaven knows what poor old paul will say when the news reaches him
p01091_B,01091,B,it isn t frittering away the strength it s enlarging the space in which you may be strong
p01092_B,01092,B,you re a clever little woman but my motto s concentrate
p01093_B,01093,B,here we all are
p01094_B,01094,B,here we are good morning helen
p01095_B,01095,B,good morning mr wilcox
p01096_B,01096,B,henry she has had such a nice letter from the queer cross boy do you remember him he had a sad moustache but the back of his head was young
p01097_B,01097,B,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you
p01098_B,01098,B,thanks to your hint he s clearing out of the porphyrion
p01099_B,01099,B,not a bad business that porphyrion
p01100_B,01100,B,not a bad surely on chelsea embankment
p01101_B,01101,B,here s our hostess good morning mrs munt fine rhododendrons good morning frau liesecke we manage to grow flowers in england don t we
p01102_B,01102,B,not a bad business
p01103_B,01103,B,no my letter s about howards end bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it i am far from sure that i shall give him permission there was no clause in the agreement in my opinion subletting is a mistake if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement morning schlegel don t you think that s better than subletting
p01104_B,01104,B,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p01105_B,01105,B,a clerk who clears out of any concern good or bad without securing a berth somewhere else first is a fool and i ve no pity for him
p01106_B,01106,B,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right
p01107_B,01107,B,dempster why goodness me yes
p01108_B,01108,B,more right than the porphyrion
p01109_B,01109,B,yes yes yes safe as houses safer
p01110_B,01110,B,very many thanks i m sorry if you sublet
p01111_B,01111,B,if he sublets i shan t have the same control in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be things may be done for which no money can compensate for instance i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt it hangs margaret we must go and see the old place some time it s pretty in its way we ll motor down and have lunch with charles
p01112_B,01112,B,i should enjoy that
p01113_B,01113,B,what about next wednesday
p01114_B,01114,B,wednesday no i couldn t well do that aunt juley expects us to stop here another week at least
p01115_B,01115,B,but you can give that up now
p01116_B,01116,B,er no
p01117_B,01117,B,oh that ll be all right i ll speak to her
p01118_B,01118,B,this visit is a high solemnity my aunt counts on it year after year she turns the house upside down for us she invites our special friends she scarcely knows frieda and we can t leave her on her hands i missed one day and she would be so hurt if i didn t stay the full ten
p01119_B,01119,B,but i ll say a word to her don t you bother
p01120_B,01120,B,henry i won t go don t bully me
p01121_B,01121,B,you want to see the house though
p01122_B,01122,B,very much i ve heard so much about it one way or the other aren t there pigs teeth in the wych elm
p01123_B,01123,B,pigs teeth
p01124_B,01124,B,and you chew the bark for toothache
p01125_B,01125,B,what a rum notion of course not
p01126_B,01126,B,perhaps i have confused it with some other tree there are still a great number of sacred trees in england it seems
p01127_B,01127,B,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p01128_B,01128,B,but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad and would smash before christmas
p01129_B,01129,B,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p01130_B,01130,B,in other words mr bast need never have left it
p01131_B,01131,B,no the fellow needn t
p01132_B,01132,B,and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary
p01133_B,01133,B,he only says reduced
p01134_B,01134,B,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p01135_B,01135,B,what what s that do you mean that i m responsible
p01136_B,01136,B,you re ridiculous helen
p01137_B,01137,B,you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen
p01138_B,01138,B,is that your point a man who had little money has less that s mine
p01139_B,01139,B,i am grieved for your clerk but it is all in the day s work it s part of the battle of life
p01140_B,01140,B,a man who had little money has less owing to us under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression
p01141_B,01141,B,oh come come you re not to blame no one s to blame
p01142_B,01142,B,is no one to blame for anything
p01143_B,01143,B,i wouldn t say that but you re taking it far too seriously who is this fellow
p01144_B,01144,B,we have told you about the fellow twice already you have even met the fellow he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile he is capable of better things we we the upper classes thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge and here s the result
p01145_B,01145,B,now a word of advice
p01146_B,01146,B,i require no more advice
p01147_B,01147,B,a word of advice don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor see that she doesn t margaret the poor are poor and one s sorry for them but there it is as civilisation moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary it s just the shoe pinching no one can help it and it might easily have been worse by all means subscribe to charities subscribe to them largely but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social question except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be point me out a time when men have been equal
p01148_B,01148,B,i didn t say
p01149_B,01149,B,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier no no you can t there always have been rich and poor i m no fatalist heaven forbid but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces and there always will be rich and poor you can t deny it and you can t deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward
p01150_B,01150,B,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p01151_B,01151,B,she rather reminds me of dolly
p01152_B,01152,B,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion i don t like those men they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow good it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr brits of today are in pain
p01153_B,01153,B,he is such a man in theory but oh helen in theory
p01154_B,01154,B,but oh meg what a theory
p01155_B,01155,B,why should you put things so bitterly dearie
p01156_B,01156,B,because i m an old maid i can t think why i go on like this myself
p01157_B,01157,B,not want but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles s
p01158_B,01158,B,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down

p01161_B,01161,B,oh helen am i will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that
p01162_B,01162,B,you mean to keep proportion and that s heroic it s greek and i don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you go on and fight with him and help him don t ask me for help or even for sympathy henceforward i m going my own way i mean to be thorough because thoroughness is easy i mean to dislike your husband and to tell him so i mean to make no concessions to tibby if tibby wants to live with me he must lump me i mean to love you more than ever yes i do you and i have built up something real because it is purely spiritual there s no veil of mystery over us unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body the popular view is as usual exactly the wrong one our bothers are over tangible things money husbands house hunting but heaven will work of itself

p01243_B,01243,B,one can t have ladies walking through the market square the fussells wouldn t like it they were awfully particular at charles s wedding my she our party was anxious to walk and certainly the church was just round the corner and i shouldn t have minded but the colonel made a great point of it
p01244_B,01244,B,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous
p01245_B,01245,B,why not
p01246_B,01246,B,we shall never get through it i think it did go off well since i had to jump out of the motor i m thankful i lighted on my left hand i am so very glad about it henry dear i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable you must all remember that we have no practical person among us except my aunt and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale
p01247_B,01247,B,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p01248_B,01248,B,my old home s falling into pieces henry i only want my new isn t it a perfect evening

p01261_B,01261,B,he has lost his place he has been turned out of his bank yes he s done for we upper classes have ruined him and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life starving his wife is ill starving she fainted in the train
p01262_B,01262,B,helen are you mad
p01263_B,01263,B,perhaps yes if you like i m mad but i ve brought them i ll stand injustice no longer i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves
p01264_B,01264,B,have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire helen
p01265_B,01265,B,there was a restaurant car on the train
p01266_B,01266,B,don t be absurd they aren t starving and you know it now begin from the beginning i won t have such theatrical nonsense how dare you yes how dare you bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way my goodness but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy look servants people out of the windows they think it s some vulgar scandal and i must explain oh no it s only my sister screaming and only two hangers on of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason
p01267_B,01267,B,kindly take back that word hangers on
p01268_B,01268,B,very well i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you ve brought them here or why you re here yourself
p01269_B,01269,B,it s our last chance of seeing mr wilcox he s going to scotland i know he is i insist on seeing him
p01270_B,01270,B,yes to morrow
p01271_B,01271,B,i knew it was our last chance
p01272_B,01272,B,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p01273_B,01273,B,there is mrs bast too
p01274_B,01274,B,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p01275_B,01275,B,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p01276_B,01276,B,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p01277_B,01277,B,that s right
p01278_B,01278,B,and went into a bank instead
p01279_B,01279,B,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p01280_B,01280,B,i hate all this
p01281_B,01281,B,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
p01282_B,01282,B,i brought them i did it all
p01283_B,01283,B,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p01284_B,01284,B,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all
p01285_B,01285,B,it s work he wants can t you see
p01286_B,01286,B,jacky let s go we re more bother than we re worth we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us and they never will there s nothing we re good enough to do
p01287_B,01287,B,we would like to find you work we want to i like my sister you re only down in your luck go to the hotel have a good night s rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
p01288_B,01288,B,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p01289_B,01289,B,won t you have something to eat i don t know what to do it isn t my house and though mr wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time as i say i don t know what to do but i undertake to do what i can for you helen offer them something do try a sandwich mrs bast
p01290_B,01290,B,no indirectly via mr wilcox
p01291_B,01291,B,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i ll do nothing no doubt you re right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry only i won t have it so choose if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them in my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice i have no use for justice if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves but he wants work and that we can t give him but possibly henry can
p01292_B,01292,B,it s his duty to
p01293_B,01293,B,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better
p01294_B,01294,B,very well i promise you take it very calmly
p01295_B,01295,B,take them off to the george then and i ll try poor creatures but they look tired i haven t nearly done with you though helen you have been most self indulgent i can t get over it you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older think it over and alter yourself or we shan t have happy lives
p01296_B,01296,B,you ll never believe me it s all right now but it was my sister
p01297_B,01297,B,helen here but she refused the invitation i thought hated weddings
p01298_B,01298,B,don t get up she has not come to the wedding i ve bundled her off to the george no she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them

p01344_B,01344,B,so that
p01345_B,01345,B,we were saying henry and i were just having the fiercest argument my point being
p01346_B,01346,B,thanks so much you see he has forgiven me
p01347_B,01347,B,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p01348_B,01348,B,so that woman has been your mistress
p01349_B,01349,B,you put it with your usual delicacy
p01350_B,01350,B,when please
p01351_B,01351,B,ten years ago
p01352_B,01352,B,i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel
p01353_B,01353,B,i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that
p01354_B,01354,B,i get no time for reading
p01355_B,01355,B,had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life
p01356_B,01356,B,i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists
p01357_B,01357,B,oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle
p01358_B,01358,B,may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i
p01359_B,01359,B,of course
p01360_B,01360,B,and your sister too
p01361_B,01361,B,of course all presentable people say i
p01362_B,01362,B,but mr wilcox he is not perhaps
p01363_B,01363,B,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either
p01364_B,01364,B,quite so quite so
p01365_B,01365,B,mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired
p01366_B,01366,B,it s better she stops in her room
p01367_B,01367,B,shall i sit up with her
p01368_B,01368,B,no thank you she does not need company
p01369_B,01369,B,mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you
p01370_B,01370,B,no oh no miss schlegel no
p01371_B,01371,B,because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common
p01372_B,01372,B,i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her
p01373_B,01373,B,how long have you been married
p01374_B,01374,B,nearly three years
p01375_B,01375,B,what did your people say
p01376_B,01376,B,they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether
p01377_B,01377,B,my good boy what a mess who are your people and your grandparents
p01378_B,01378,B,they were just nothing at all agricultural labourers and that sort
p01379_B,01379,B,so from which part
p01380_B,01380,B,lincolnshire mostly but my mother s father he oddly enough came from these parts round here
p01381_B,01381,B,from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast
p01382_B,01382,B,oh i don t know
p01383_B,01383,B,excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now
p01384_B,01384,B,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not
p01385_B,01385,B,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men
p01386_B,01386,B,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking
p01387_B,01387,B,settle down to what
p01388_B,01388,B,oh just settle down
p01389_B,01389,B,and that s to be life how can you with all the beautiful things to see and do with music with walking at night
p01390_B,01390,B,walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful
p01391_B,01391,B,why not
p01392_B,01392,B,because i see one must have money
p01393_B,01393,B,well you re wrong
p01394_B,01394,B,i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream
p01395_B,01395,B,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i
p01396_B,01396,B,i wonder
p01397_B,01397,B,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever
p01398_B,01398,B,i am as afraid of death as any one
p01399_B,01399,B,but not of the idea of death
p01400_B,01400,B,but what is the difference
p01401_B,01401,B,infinite difference
p01402_B,01402,B,i must be stupid
p01403_B,01403,B,death destroys a man the idea of death saves him so never give in
p01404_B,01404,B,i thought some one had got in
p01405_B,01405,B,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him i don t know about later but now the basts must clearly go
p01406_B,01406,B,did you say that your sister is sleeping here after all
p01407_B,01407,B,i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed will you tell the servants about helen could some one go to carry her bag you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear
p01408_B,01408,B,far too much screaming there
p01409_B,01409,B,henry dear henry dear look at me no i won t have you shirking look at me there that s all
p01410_B,01410,B,you re referring to last evening i have released you from your engagement i could find excuses but i won t no i won t a thousand times no i m a bad lot and must be left at that
p01411_B,01411,B,leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference
p01412_B,01412,B,no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man
p01413_B,01413,B,it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess
p01414_B,01414,B,cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference
p01415_B,01415,B,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast
p01416_B,01416,B,good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth
p01417_B,01417,B,didn t she send me a message or anything
p01418_B,01418,B,i heard of none
p01419_B,01419,B,would you ring the bell please
p01420_B,01420,B,what to do
p01421_B,01421,B,why to inquire i ll go thank you
p01422_B,01422,B,it is no good those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started i have known cases of other men i despised them once i thought that i m different i shall never be tempted oh margaret we fellows all come to grief once in our time will you believe that there are moments when the strongest man that s true isn t it if you knew all you would excuse me i was far from good influences far even from england i was very very lonely and longed for a woman s voice that s enough i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now
p01423_B,01423,B,yes that s enough dear
p01424_B,01424,B,i have i have been through hell
p01425_B,01425,B,i have already forgiven you henry
p01426_B,01426,B,well let them go the man and his wife i mean for the more we see of your sister the better
p01427_B,01427,B,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means
p01428_B,01428,B,what did you say in the notes
p01429_B,01429,B,i told you last night
p01430_B,01430,B,oh ah yes dear would you like one turn in the garden
p01431_B,01431,B,i am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the george helen would not have left unless she had heard something i mismanaged that it is wretched i ought to have parted her from that woman at once
p01432_B,01432,B,i am far from a saint in fact the reverse but you have taken me for better or worse bygones must be bygones you have promised to forgive me margaret a promise is a promise never mention that woman again
p01433_B,01433,B,except for some practical reason never
p01434_B,01434,B,practical you practical
p01435_B,01435,B,yes i m practical
p01436_B,01436,B,at all events you mustn t worry this is a man s business on no account mention it to anybody
p01437_B,01437,B,who s for lunch why such an early start
p01438_B,01438,B,sunrise or something when i could get away
p01439_B,01439,B,so i surmise why
p01440_B,01440,B,i don t know what s to be done tibby i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place i stopped here to tell you this give meg my love and say that i want to be alone i mean to go to munich or else bonn
p01441_B,01441,B,such a message is easily given
p01442_B,01442,B,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though my head is rather wretched i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in not there
p01443_B,01443,B,do you mind mrs martlett coming in or shall i take it from her at the door
p01444_B,01444,B,could i bathe my eyes tibby now for the explanation why didn t i begin with it i have found out something about mr wilcox he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people s lives it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do mrs bast
p01445_B,01445,B,oh those people shall i lock the door again
p01446_B,01446,B,no thanks tibbikins you re being very good to me i want to tell you the story before i go abroad you must do exactly what you like treat it as part of the furniture meg cannot have heard it yet i think but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself i don t even know whether she ought to be told knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match i simply don t know what to make of such a thing i trust your judgment what would you do
p01447_B,01447,B,i gather he has had a mistress
p01448_B,01448,B,and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself
p01449_B,01449,B,it is certainly a very bad business
p01450_B,01450,B,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion but you are right outside it and you must know in a day or two or perhaps a week take whatever steps you think fit i leave it in your hands the facts as they touch meg are all before you
p01451_B,01451,B,you see helen have a cigarette i don t see what i m to do
p01452_B,01452,B,then there s nothing to be done i dare say you are right let them marry there remains the question of compensation
p01453_B,01453,B,do you want me to adjudicate that too had you not better consult an expert
p01454_B,01454,B,this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this
p01455_B,01455,B,what is the sum
p01456_B,01456,B,five thousand
p01457_B,01457,B,good god alive
p01458_B,01458,B,now what is the good of driblets to go through life having done one thing to have raised one person from the abyss not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets making the grey more grey no doubt people will think me extraordinary
p01459_B,01459,B,i don t care an iota what people think but it s half what you have
p01460_B,01460,B,not nearly half i have far too much and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two it isn t enough i didn t expect you to understand me
p01461_B,01461,B,i i understand nobody
p01462_B,01462,B,but you ll do it
p01463_B,01463,B,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp
p01464_B,01464,B,my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special
p01465_B,01465,B,why did you go there then
p01466_B,01466,B,i because why have we come to the tyrol if it comes to that one might go on asking such questions indefinitely the truth is i took oniton on account of evie don t let this go any further
p01467_B,01467,B,certainly not
p01468_B,01468,B,i shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged poor little girl she was so keen on it all and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting afraid it would get snapped up just like all of your sex well no harm s done she has had her country wedding and i ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school
p01469_B,01469,B,where shall we live then henry i should enjoy living somewhere
p01470_B,01470,B,i have not yet decided what about norfolk it is now what nearly october let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring
p01471_B,01471,B,if possible something permanent i can t be as young as i was for these alterations don t suit me
p01472_B,01472,B,but my dear which would you rather have alterations or rheumatism
p01473_B,01473,B,i see your point if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys only in the spring let us look before we leap i will take warning by evie and not hurry you remember that you have a free hand this time these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive
p01474_B,01474,B,what a practical little woman it is what s it been reading theo theo how much
p01475_B,01475,B,why dolly here s a surprise how are the boys and the baby
p01476_B,01476,B,but lucky you with four courts of your own at midhurst
p01477_B,01477,B,it will be very jolly
p01478_B,01478,B,are those the plans does it matter my seeing them
p01479_B,01479,B,of course not
p01480_B,01480,B,charles has never seen the plans
p01481_B,01481,B,they have only just arrived here is the ground floor no that s rather difficult try the elevation we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky line
p01482_B,01482,B,what makes it smell so funny
p01483_B,01483,B,i suppose the paper
p01484_B,01484,B,and which way up is it
p01485_B,01485,B,just the ordinary way up that s the sky line and the part that smells strongest is the sky
p01486_B,01486,B,well ask me another margaret oh what was i going to say how s helen
p01487_B,01487,B,quite well
p01488_B,01488,B,is she never coming back to england every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t
p01489_B,01489,B,so it is helen is odd awfully she has now been away eight months
p01490_B,01490,B,but hasn t she any address
p01491_B,01491,B,a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address do write her a line i will look it up for you
p01492_B,01492,B,no don t bother that s eight months she has been away surely
p01493_B,01493,B,exactly she left just after evie s wedding it would be eight months
p01494_B,01494,B,just when baby was born then
p01495_B,01495,B,just so
p01496_B,01496,B,oh yes that is it miss avery has been unpacking your packing cases
p01497_B,01497,B,why has she done that how unnecessary
p01498_B,01498,B,ask another i suppose you ordered her to
p01499_B,01499,B,i gave no such orders perhaps she was airing the things she did undertake to light an occasional fire
p01500_B,01500,B,it was far more than an air the floor sounds covered with books charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don t know
p01501_B,01501,B,books dolly are you serious has she been touching our books
p01502_B,01502,B,hasn t she though what used to be the hall s full of them charles thought for certain you knew of it
p01503_B,01503,B,i am very much obliged to you dolly what can have come over miss avery i must go down about it at once some of the books are my brother s and are quite valuable she had no right to open any of the cases
p01504_B,01504,B,i say she s dotty she was the one that never got married you know oh i say perhaps she thinks your books are wedding presents to herself old maids are taken that way sometimes miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie
p01505_B,01505,B,i hadn t heard of that
p01506_B,01506,B,didn t you know she gave evie a present last august and evie returned it and then oh goloshes you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote
p01507_B,01507,B,but it was wrong of evie to return it it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing
p01508_B,01508,B,but the present was so expensive
p01509_B,01509,B,why does that make any difference dolly
p01510_B,01510,B,still when it costs over five pounds i didn t see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman now can you
p01511_B,01511,B,you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married
p01512_B,01512,B,oh mine was old earthenware stuff not worth a halfpenny evie s was quite different you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do evie didn t want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble
p01513_B,01513,B,but miss avery said
p01514_B,01514,B,it was a perfectly awful letter charles said it was the letter of a madman in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond
p01515_B,01515,B,did she give any reasons
p01516_B,01516,B,we think she meant to be invited to oniton and so climb into society
p01517_B,01517,B,she s rather old for that may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother
p01518_B,01518,B,that s a notion give every one their due eh well i suppose i ought to be toddling come along mr muff you want a new coat but i don t know who ll give it you i m sure oh yes
p01519_B,01519,B,i wonder then why he let me ask her to look after the house
p01520_B,01520,B,but she s only a farm woman
p01521_B,01521,B,oh yes mrs wilcox quite sure she is here daily
p01522_B,01522,B,have you got the key auntie
p01523_B,01523,B,madge go away
p01524_B,01524,B,auntie it s mrs wilcox
p01525_B,01525,B,your niece and i have come together
p01526_B,01526,B,madge go away this is no moment for your hat
p01527_B,01527,B,auntie gets more eccentric lately
p01528_B,01528,B,miss avery i have come about the furniture could you kindly let me in
p01529_B,01529,B,yes mrs wilcox of course
p01530_B,01530,B,i hope miss avery is not ill
p01531_B,01531,B,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p01532_B,01532,B,well come right in mrs wilcox
p01533_B,01533,B,thank you so much
p01534_B,01534,B,come right into the hall first
p01535_B,01535,B,i m afraid this isn t what we meant mr wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched for instance these books are my brother s we are storing them for him and for my sister who is abroad when you kindly undertook to look after things we never expected you to do so much
p01536_B,01536,B,the house has been empty long enough
p01537_B,01537,B,i dare say we didn t explain it has been a mistake and very likely our mistake
p01538_B,01538,B,mrs wilcox it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years the house is mrs wilcox s and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer
p01539_B,01539,B,yes mrs wilcox s house the mother of mr charles
p01540_B,01540,B,mistake upon mistake mistake upon mistake
p01541_B,01541,B,well i don t know i really don t know what s to be done
p01542_B,01542,B,yes it should be a merry house enough
p01543_B,01543,B,i don t know i dare say well thank you very much miss avery yes that s all right delightful
p01544_B,01544,B,there is still the parlour and the dining room then through here i ve not finished here yet there s still a deal to do the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs for there is no need to go into expense at hilton
p01545_B,01545,B,it is all a mistake a misunderstanding mr wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end
p01546_B,01546,B,oh indeed on account of his hay fever
p01547_B,01547,B,we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex and part of this furniture my part will go down there presently
p01548_B,01548,B,you think that you won t come back to live here mrs wilcox but you will
p01549_B,01549,B,that remains to be seen we have no intention of doing so for the present we happen to need a much larger house circumstances oblige us to give big parties of course some day one never knows does one
p01550_B,01550,B,some day tcha tcha don t talk about some day you are living here now
p01551_B,01551,B,am i
p01552_B,01552,B,you are living here and have been for the last ten minutes if you ask me the nursery
p01553_B,01553,B,it s a beautiful meadow
p01554_B,01554,B,yes the maidy s well enough for those that is who don t suffer from sneezing i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time oh they ought to do this they mustn t do that he d learn them to be lads and just then the tickling took him he has it from his father with other things there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth
p01555_B,01555,B,my brother gets hay fever too
p01556_B,01556,B,this house lies too much on the land for them naturally they were glad enough to slip in at first but wilcoxes are better than nothing as i see you ve found they keep a place going don t they yes it is just that
p01557_B,01557,B,they keep england going it is my opinion
p01558_B,01558,B,ay they breed like rabbits well well it s a funny world but he who made it knows what he wants in it i suppose if mrs charlie is expecting her fourth it isn t for us to repine
p01559_B,01559,B,they breed and they also work it certainly is a funny world but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it i think it ll never be a bad one never really bad
p01560_B,01560,B,no better n nothing i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died but we stayed civil it was a very civil family old mrs howard never spoke against anybody nor let any one be turned away without food then it was never trespassers will be prosecuted in their land but would people please not come in mrs howard was never created to run a farm
p01561_B,01561,B,had they no men to help them
p01562_B,01562,B,things went on until there were no men
p01563_B,01563,B,until mr wilcox came along
p01564_B,01564,B,i suppose so but ruth should have married a no disrespect to you to say this for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way whether she got him first or no
p01565_B,01565,B,whom should she have married
p01566_B,01566,B,a soldier some real soldier but that s all over a better time is coming now though you ve kept me long enough waiting in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening have you ordered in coals
p01567_B,01567,B,we are not coming no not coming never coming it has all been a mistake the furniture must be repacked at once and i am very sorry but i am making other arrangements and must ask you to give me the keys
p01568_B,01568,B,certainly mrs wilcox
p01569_B,01569,B,helen won t be able to stop aunt juley she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
p01570_B,01570,B,how very odd of helen mr wilcox
p01571_B,01571,B,yes dear
p01572_B,01572,B,can he spare you margaret important i should like you to have some companion to take walks with do try miss conder
p01573_B,01573,B,i have been for a little walk with miss conder
p01574_B,01574,B,but she is not really interesting if only you had helen
p01575_B,01575,B,i have tibby aunt juley
p01576_B,01576,B,no but he has to do his chinese some real companion is what you need really helen is odd
p01577_B,01577,B,helen is odd very
p01578_B,01578,B,not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once
p01579_B,01579,B,no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us she has not the least balance
p01580_B,01580,B,about helen
p01581_B,01581,B,perhaps he has come across that sort of thing
p01582_B,01582,B,he would do all he could but
p01583_B,01583,B,oh you know best but he is practical
p01584_B,01584,B,tibby love what next
p01585_B,01585,B,it is extraordinary
p01586_B,01586,B,dear your judgment s often clearer than mine have you any notion what s at the back
p01587_B,01587,B,none unless it s something mental
p01588_B,01588,B,oh that quite impossible
p01589_B,01589,B,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p01590_B,01590,B,don t ask me i m a plain man of business i live and let live my advice to you both is don t worry margaret you ve got black marks again under your eyes you know that s strictly forbidden first your aunt then your sister no we aren t going to have it are we theobald i ll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband
p01591_B,01591,B,all the same you have not quite seen our point
p01592_B,01592,B,i don t suppose i ever shall
p01593_B,01593,B,margaret s point is this our sister may be mad
p01594_B,01594,B,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p01595_B,01595,B,i m afraid i cannot what are the facts we are all mad more or less you know in these days
p01596_B,01596,B,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p01597_B,01597,B,she has never behaved like this before then
p01598_B,01598,B,of course not
p01599_B,01599,B,well my dear how am i to know
p01600_B,01600,B,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely
p01601_B,01601,B,oh yes she and i have always hit it off together
p01602_B,01602,B,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean
p01603_B,01603,B,you want to get hold of her that s the problem isn t it she has got to see a doctor
p01604_B,01604,B,for all i know she has seen one already
p01605_B,01605,B,yes yes don t interrupt i ve got it it s perfectly easy leave it to me we ll send her down to howards end
p01606_B,01606,B,how will you do that
p01607_B,01607,B,after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there
p01608_B,01608,B,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me
p01609_B,01609,B,of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time
p01610_B,01610,B,it s quite impossible
p01611_B,01611,B,it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame
p01612_B,01612,B,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p01613_B,01613,B,no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t
p01614_B,01614,B,i see you have scruples
p01615_B,01615,B,i suppose so
p01616_B,01616,B,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness
p01617_B,01617,B,i deny it s madness
p01618_B,01618,B,you said just now
p01619_B,01619,B,it s madness when i say it but not when you say it
p01620_B,01620,B,margaret margaret no education can teach a woman logic now my dear my time is valuable do you want me to help you or not
p01621_B,01621,B,not in that way
p01622_B,01622,B,answer my question plain question plain answer do
p01623_B,01623,B,pater we may as well keep howards end out of it
p01624_B,01624,B,why charles
p01625_B,01625,B,the whole house is at sixes and sevens we don t want any more mess
p01626_B,01626,B,who s we my boy pray who s we
p01627_B,01627,B,i am sure i beg your pardon i appear always to be intruding
p01628_B,01628,B,i can t have this sort of behaviour my boy margaret s too sweet natured to mind but i mind for her is anything wrong with you charles this afternoon
p01629_B,01629,B,no pater but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon
p01630_B,01630,B,she was bound to drive there will be her books
p01631_B,01631,B,i cannot make it out
p01632_B,01632,B,finish your coffee dear we must be off
p01633_B,01633,B,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p01634_B,01634,B,you re not fit for it let me go alone i know exactly what to do
p01635_B,01635,B,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off
p01636_B,01636,B,don t you want to tidy yourself
p01637_B,01637,B,have i time
p01638_B,01638,B,yes plenty
p01639_B,01639,B,yes mr wilcox i see
p01640_B,01640,B,say anything you like all right
p01641_B,01641,B,perhaps i was not at lunch but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now
p01642_B,01642,B,i was meaning to act for the best
p01643_B,01643,B,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so
p01644_B,01644,B,certainly dear girl are you all right now
p01645_B,01645,B,look my hands have stopped trembling
p01646_B,01646,B,and have quite forgiven me then listen her cab should already have arrived at howards end we re a little late but no matter our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm as if possible one doesn t want a scene before servants a certain gentleman won t drive in but will wait a little short of the front gate behind the laurels have you still the keys of the house
p01647_B,01647,B,oh my darling yes all right
p01648_B,01648,B,go away
p01649_B,01649,B,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen
p01650_B,01650,B,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all
p01651_B,01651,B,manage what
p01652_B,01652,B,stop that at least
p01653_B,01653,B,come this is an odd beginning
p01654_B,01654,B,i cannot help it do wait it s not my fault please all four of you go away now
p01655_B,01655,B,we are relying on you to help us mrs wilcox could you go in and persuade your sister to come out
p01656_B,01656,B,on what grounds i beg your pardon but it is nothing of the sort you are not qualified to attend my sister mr mansbridge if we require your services we will let you know
p01657_B,01657,B,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish
p01658_B,01658,B,you could but you have not you are therefore not qualified to attend my sister
p01659_B,01659,B,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door
p01660_B,01660,B,forgive me but i will not
p01661_B,01661,B,i don t agree
p01662_B,01662,B,this business is as broad as it s long we had better all work together you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
p01663_B,01663,B,quite so
p01664_B,01664,B,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
p01665_B,01665,B,margaret margaret
p01666_B,01666,B,well henry send your doctor away what possible use is he now it all turns on affection now affection don t you see surely you see i like helen very much you not so much mr mansbridge doesn t know her that s all and affection when reciprocated gives rights put that down in your note book mr mansbridge it s a useful formula you don t know what you want yourselves for one sensible remark i will let you in but you cannot make it you would trouble my sister for no reason i will not permit it i ll stand here all the day sooner
p01667_B,01667,B,mansbridge perhaps not now
p01668_B,01668,B,convenient you did not tell me that the books were unpacked i have found nearly everything that i want
p01669_B,01669,B,i told you nothing that was true
p01670_B,01670,B,it has been a great surprise certainly has aunt juley been ill
p01671_B,01671,B,helen you wouldn t think i d invent that
p01672_B,01672,B,i suppose not but one loses faith in everything after this
p01673_B,01673,B,we thought it was illness but even then i haven t behaved worthily i ought not to have consulted any one what would our father have thought of me
p01674_B,01674,B,yes i am annoyed my wishes should have been respected i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary planning my life as i now have to do
p01675_B,01675,B,come away from those books helen do talk to me
p01676_B,01676,B,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard one can t go through a great deal of without planning one s actions in advance i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me i will go through them if necessary but only then in the second place i have no right to trouble people i cannot fit in with england as i know it i have done something that the english never pardon it would not be right for them to pardon it so i must live where i am not known
p01677_B,01677,B,but why didn t you tell me dearest
p01678_B,01678,B,yes i might have but decided to wait
p01679_B,01679,B,i believe you would never have told me
p01680_B,01680,B,oh yes i should we have taken a flat in munich by we i mean myself and monica but for her i am and have been and always wish to be alone
p01681_B,01681,B,i have not heard of monica
p01682_B,01682,B,you wouldn t have she s an italian by birth at least she makes her living by journalism i met her originally on garda monica is much the best person to see me through
p01683_B,01683,B,you are very fond of her then
p01684_B,01684,B,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me you must not think that we shall never meet i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better but you haven t understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you this is a shock to you it isn t to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps such as this i cannot live in england
p01685_B,01685,B,helen you ve not forgiven me for my treachery you couldn t talk like this to me if you had
p01686_B,01686,B,oh meg dear why do we talk at all tell me how is it that all the books are down here
p01687_B,01687,B,series of mistakes
p01688_B,01688,B,and a great deal of furniture has been unpacked
p01689_B,01689,B,no one
p01690_B,01690,B,i suppose you are letting it though
p01691_B,01691,B,the house is dead why worry on about it
p01692_B,01692,B,but i am interested you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life i am still helen i hope now this hasn t the feel of a dead house the hall seems more alive even than in the old days when it held the wilcoxes own things
p01693_B,01693,B,interested are you very well i must tell you i suppose my husband lent it on condition we but by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of look here i can t go on like this i warn you i won t helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry
p01694_B,01694,B,i don t hate him now i have stopped being a schoolgirl and meg once again i m not being unkind but as for fitting in with your english life no put it out of your head at once imagine a visit from me at ducie street it s unthinkable tell me about yourself
p01695_B,01695,B,there s nothing to tell
p01696_B,01696,B,but your marriage has been happy meg
p01697_B,01697,B,yes but i don t feel inclined to talk
p01698_B,01698,B,you feel as i do
p01699_B,01699,B,not that but i can t
p01700_B,01700,B,no more can i it is a nuisance but no good trying look here meg is the coast clear
p01701_B,01701,B,you mean that you want to go away from me
p01702_B,01702,B,i suppose so dear old lady it isn t any use i knew we should have nothing to say give my love to aunt juley and tibby and take more yourself than i can say promise to come and see me in munich later
p01703_B,01703,B,certainly dearest
p01704_B,01704,B,for that is all we can do i am glad to have seen you and the things
p01705_B,01705,B,the car has gone and here s your cab
p01706_B,01706,B,how did this come henry would have done what he could
p01707_B,01707,B,this is mr wilcox s house
p01708_B,01708,B,surely you remember howards end
p01709_B,01709,B,remember i who remember everything but it looks to be ours now
p01710_B,01710,B,miss avery was extraordinary she loved mrs wilcox and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty in consequence here are all the library books
p01711_B,01711,B,not all the books she hasn t unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense and we never used to have the sword here
p01712_B,01712,B,the sword looks well though
p01713_B,01713,B,where s the piano meg
p01714_B,01714,B,i warehoused that in london why
p01715_B,01715,B,the carpet s a mistake i know that we had it in london but this floor ought to be bare it is far too beautiful
p01716_B,01716,B,you still have a mania for under furnishing would you care to come into the dining room before you start there s no carpet there
p01717_B,01717,B,oh what a place for mother s chiffonier
p01718_B,01718,B,look at the chairs though
p01719_B,01719,B,oh look at them wickham place faced north didn t it
p01720_B,01720,B,north west
p01721_B,01721,B,anyhow it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun feel their dear little backs are quite warm
p01722_B,01722,B,but why has miss avery made them set to partners i shall just
p01723_B,01723,B,over here meg put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn ye es the window s too high
p01724_B,01724,B,try a drawing room chair
p01725_B,01725,B,no i don t like the drawing room so much the beam has been match boarded it would have been so beautiful otherwise
p01726_B,01726,B,helen what a memory you have for some things you re perfectly right it s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women men don t know what we want
p01727_B,01727,B,and never will
p01728_B,01728,B,i don t agree in two thousand years they ll know look where tibby spilt the soup
p01729_B,01729,B,coffee it was coffee surely impossible tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time
p01730_B,01730,B,was father alive
p01731_B,01731,B,i know no i don t what a detestable boy tibby was
p01732_B,01732,B,but the rhyme was simply awful no decent person could put up with it
p01733_B,01733,B,ah that greengage tree why do i connect it with dumb bells and there come the chickens the grass wants cutting i love yellow hammers
p01734_B,01734,B,i have got it that every morning for three weeks no wonder tibby was wild
p01735_B,01735,B,tibby is moderately a dear now
p01736_B,01736,B,there i knew you d say that in the end of course he s a dear listen what s that
p01737_B,01737,B,perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege
p01738_B,01738,B,what nonsense listen
p01739_B,01739,B,it is always meg
p01740_B,01740,B,little boy what do you want
p01741_B,01741,B,please i am the milk
p01742_B,01742,B,did miss avery send you
p01743_B,01743,B,yes please
p01744_B,01744,B,then take it back and say we require no milk no it s not the siege but possibly an attempt to provision us against one
p01745_B,01745,B,but i like milk why send it away
p01746_B,01746,B,do you oh very well but we ve nothing to put it in and he wants the can
p01747_B,01747,B,please i m to call in the morning for the can
p01748_B,01748,B,the house will be locked up then
p01749_B,01749,B,in the morning would i bring eggs too
p01750_B,01750,B,are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week well run away and do it again
p01751_B,01751,B,nice little boy i say what s your name mine s helen
p01752_B,01752,B,mine are lop eareds
p01753_B,01753,B,you re a very good and rather a clever little boy mind you come again isn t he charming
p01754_B,01754,B,undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers
p01755_B,01755,B,what do you mean
p01756_B,01756,B,i don t know
p01757_B,01757,B,because i probably agree with you
p01758_B,01758,B,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live
p01759_B,01759,B,i do agree but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago
p01760_B,01760,B,meaning that i was dead i felt it
p01761_B,01761,B,yes the house has a surer life than we even if it was empty and as it is i can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture after all wickham place was a grave meg i ve a startling idea
p01762_B,01762,B,what is it
p01763_B,01763,B,drink some milk to steady you no i won t tell you yet because you may laugh or be angry let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing then one would see really about my idea couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night
p01764_B,01764,B,i don t think we could well do that
p01765_B,01765,B,here are beds tables towels
p01766_B,01766,B,i know but the house isn t supposed to be slept in and henry s suggestion was
p01767_B,01767,B,i require no suggestions i shall not alter anything in my plans but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you it will be something to look back on oh meg lovey do let s
p01768_B,01768,B,but helen my pet we can t without getting henry s leave of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate
p01769_B,01769,B,ducie street is his house this is ours our furniture our sort of people coming to the door do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk why not it s a moon
p01770_B,01770,B,i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles
p01771_B,01771,B,i know he won t like it but i am going to pass out of their lives what difference will it make in the long run if they say and she even spent the night at howards end
p01772_B,01772,B,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before
p01773_B,01773,B,because my plans
p01774_B,01774,B,which you change in a moment
p01775_B,01775,B,then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home
p01776_B,01776,B,it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand
p01777_B,01777,B,yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you
p01778_B,01778,B,i needn t say how much it would mean to me
p01779_B,01779,B,then let us
p01780_B,01780,B,it is no good hesitating shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave
p01781_B,01781,B,oh we don t want leave charles may say no
p01782_B,01782,B,we shan t consult him
p01783_B,01783,B,go if you like i should have stopped without leave
p01784_B,01784,B,expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing
p01785_B,01785,B,not a thing only an ending
p01786_B,01786,B,that s not what i was saying
p01787_B,01787,B,it is
p01788_B,01788,B,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring
p01789_B,01789,B,no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end
p01790_B,01790,B,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you
p01791_B,01791,B,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name
p01792_B,01792,B,would she not tell you
p01793_B,01793,B,i never even asked her who seduced her
p01794_B,01794,B,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you
p01795_B,01795,B,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills
p01796_B,01796,B,as you like
p01797_B,01797,B,have you anything else to ask me henry
p01798_B,01798,B,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us
p01799_B,01799,B,who is we
p01800_B,01800,B,i thought it best to ring up charles
p01801_B,01801,B,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain
p01802_B,01802,B,he has at once gone to call on your brother
p01803_B,01803,B,that too was unnecessary
p01804_B,01804,B,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name
p01805_B,01805,B,are we to make her seducer marry her
p01806_B,01806,B,if possible yes
p01807_B,01807,B,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases
p01808_B,01808,B,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life
p01809_B,01809,B,may i ask you my question now
p01810_B,01810,B,certainly my dear
p01811_B,01811,B,to morrow helen goes to munich
p01812_B,01812,B,well possibly she is right
p01813_B,01813,B,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end
p01814_B,01814,B,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel
p01815_B,01815,B,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending
p01816_B,01816,B,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact
p01817_B,01817,B,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it
p01818_B,01818,B,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold
p01819_B,01819,B,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to
p01820_B,01820,B,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps
p01821_B,01821,B,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow
p01822_B,01822,B,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too
p01823_B,01823,B,she cannot be left alone
p01824_B,01824,B,that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles
p01825_B,01825,B,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him
p01826_B,01826,B,margaret my margaret
p01827_B,01827,B,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all
p01828_B,01828,B,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles
p01829_B,01829,B,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property
p01830_B,01830,B,my dear you are forgetting yourself
p01831_B,01831,B,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking
p01832_B,01832,B,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did
p01833_B,01833,B,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough
p01834_B,01834,B,as i have actually been forgiven
p01835_B,01835,B,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question
p01836_B,01836,B,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once
p01837_B,01837,B,you have mentioned mrs wilcox
p01838_B,01838,B,i beg your pardon
p01839_B,01839,B,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast
p01840_B,01840,B,you have not been yourself all day
p01841_B,01841,B,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done
p01842_B,01842,B,the two cases are different
p01843_B,01843,B,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry
p01844_B,01844,B,i perceive you are attempting blackmail it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end
p01845_B,01845,B,in what sense
p01846_B,01846,B,if a man played about with my sister i d send a bullet through him but perhaps you don t mind
p01847_B,01847,B,i mind very much
p01848_B,01848,B,who d ye suspect then speak out man one always suspects some one
p01849_B,01849,B,no one i don t think so
p01850_B,01850,B,you are hiding something when you saw her last did she mention any one s name yes or no
p01851_B,01851,B,in my rooms she mentioned some friends called the basts
p01852_B,01852,B,who are the basts
p01853_B,01853,B,people friends of hers at evie s wedding
p01854_B,01854,B,i don t remember but by great scott i do my aunt told me about some rag tag was she full of them when you saw her is there a man did she speak of the man or look here have you had any dealings with him i see you are in his confidence they met at your rooms oh what a family what a family god help the poor pater
p01855_B,01855,B,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others
p01856_B,01856,B,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts
p01857_B,01857,B,looking back that was wrong of me
p01858_B,01858,B,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul
p01859_B,01859,B,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge
p01860_B,01860,B,i did react until i found poor leonard i am steady now i shan t ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy yes i do at last understand
p01861_B,01861,B,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements
p01862_B,01862,B,because in death i agree
p01863_B,01863,B,not quite i feel that you and i and henry are only fragments of that woman s mind she knows everything she is everything she is the house and the tree that leans over it people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness i cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine she knew about realities she knew when people were in love though she was not in the room i don t doubt that she knew when henry deceived her
p01864_B,01864,B,oh good night miss avery
p01865_B,01865,B,why should miss avery work for us
p01866_B,01866,B,why indeed
p01867_B,01867,B,this is not quite our house yet when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists
p01868_B,01868,B,we shall be that everywhere and for ever
p01869_B,01869,B,but affectionate tourists
p01870_B,01870,B,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home
p01871_B,01871,B,i can t pretend very long sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case unless you will come with me
p01872_B,01872,B,are you serious in asking me helen should i get on with your monica
p01873_B,01873,B,you would not but i am serious in asking you
p01874_B,01874,B,still no more plans now and no more reminiscences sleep now
p01875_B,01875,B,she s out
p01876_B,01876,B,when will she be back
p01877_B,01877,B,i ll ask
p01878_B,01878,B,i ll ask sir
p01879_B,01879,B,no don t bother
p01880_B,01880,B,they have taken the car to howards end you appear to want to know a good deal
p01881_B,01881,B,is it a village please
p01882_B,01882,B,village it s mr wilcox s private house at least it s one of them mrs wilcox keeps her furniture there hilton is the village
p01883_B,01883,B,yes and when will they be back
p01884_B,01884,B,mr schlegel doesn t know we can t know everything can we
p01885_B,01885,B,why horrible it s ordinary light from the moon but it moves so does the moon but it is a clenched fist why not but it is going to touch me let it is there life in the moon of course but i thought it was uninhabited not by time death judgment and the smaller snakes smaller snakes what a notion
p01886_B,01886,B,hullo len what ho len
p01887_B,01887,B,what ho jacky see you again later
p01888_B,01888,B,mrs wilcox i have done wrong
p01889_B,01889,B,bring me a stick get some water he s shamming of course i only used the blade here carry him out into the air
p01890_B,01890,B,yes murder s enough
p01891_B,01891,B,i don t know where she is pater dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her
p01892_B,01892,B,tell me when she comes in
p01893_B,01893,B,i ll sit up for her as late as you like but she can hardly be coming isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel
p01894_B,01894,B,perhaps perhaps
p01895_B,01895,B,can i do anything for you sir
p01896_B,01896,B,not to night my boy i can t sleep i had better have a talk with you and get it over she will feel differently in the morning but i cannot let this kind of thing continue without comment i am morally certain that she is with her sister at howards end the house is mine and charles it will be yours and when i say that no one is to live there i mean that no one is to live there i won t have it to my mind this question is connected with something far greater the rights of property itself
p01897_B,01897,B,then at eight to morrow i may go up in the car
p01898_B,01898,B,eight or earlier say that you are acting as my representative and of course use no violence charles
p01899_B,01899,B,it has been pretty horrible they were there and they had the man up there with them too
p01900_B,01900,B,what what man
p01901_B,01901,B,i told you last night his name was bast
p01902_B,01902,B,my god is it possible in your mother s house charles in your mother s house
p01903_B,01903,B,i know pater that was what i felt as a matter of fact there is no need to trouble about the man he was in the last stages of heart disease and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off the police are seeing about it at this moment i got up there oh it couldn t have been more than half past seven the avery woman was lighting a fire for them they were still upstairs i waited in the drawing room we were all moderately civil and collected though i had my suspicions i gave them your message and mrs wilcox said in that way of hers
p01904_B,01904,B,nothing else
p01905_B,01905,B,i promised to tell you with her love that she was going to germany with her sister this evening that was all we had time for because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding for suddenly mrs wilcox screamed out his name i recognised it and i went for him in the hall was i right pater i thought things were going a little too far
p01906_B,01906,B,right my dear boy i don t know but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t then did he just just crumple up as you said
p01907_B,01907,B,he caught hold of the bookcase which came down over him so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden we all thought he was shamming however he s dead right enough awful business
p01908_B,01908,B,sword what sword whose sword
p01909_B,01909,B,a sword of theirs
p01910_B,01910,B,what were you doing with it
p01911_B,01911,B,well didn t you see pater i had to snatch up the first thing handy i hadn t a riding whip or stick i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword
p01912_B,01912,B,then what
p01913_B,01913,B,he pulled over the bookcase as i said and fell
p01914_B,01914,B,but the real cause was heart disease of that you re sure
p01915_B,01915,B,that or a fit however we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics
p01916_B,01916,B,i think i ll go round to the police station
p01917_B,01917,B,what for
p01918_B,01918,B,very well sir which car will you have
p01919_B,01919,B,i think i ll walk
p01920_B,01920,B,it s a good half mile the sun s very hot for april shan t i take you up and then perhaps a little spin round by tewin
p01921_B,01921,B,you go on as if i didn t know my own mind you young fellows one idea is to get into a motor i tell you i want to walk i m very fond of walking
p01922_B,01922,B,oh all right i m about the house if you want me for anything i thought of not going up to the office to day if that is your wish
p01923_B,01923,B,it is indeed my boy
p01924_B,01924,B,i expected that i shall naturally be the most important witness there
p01925_B,01925,B,no doubt mr wilcox may have induced death but if it wasn t one thing it would have been another as you know
p01926_B,01926,B,he didn t say madam
p01927_B,01927,B,you haven t any note for me
p01928_B,01928,B,he didn t say madam
p01929_B,01929,B,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p01930_B,01930,B,what about
p01931_B,01931,B,i am going to germany with my sister i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home our talk last night was more important than you have realised i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you
p01932_B,01932,B,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down
p01933_B,01933,B,certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass here are your keys
p01934_B,01934,B,i have something to tell you
p01935_B,01935,B,i don t want to hear it my sister is going to be ill my life is going to be with her now we must manage to build up something she and i and her child
p01936_B,01936,B,where are you going

p01941_B,01941,B,what was that
p01942_B,01942,B,tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay
p01943_B,01943,B,i haven t the least notion
p01944_B,01944,B,now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter will you be as careful as all that
p01945_B,01945,B,that child is a wonderful nursemaid
p01946_B,01946,B,he is fond of baby that s why he does it they re going to be lifelong friends
p01947_B,01947,B,starting at the ages of six and one
p01948_B,01948,B,of course it will be a great thing for tom
p01949_B,01949,B,it may be a greater thing for baby
p01950_B,01950,B,what a time they all are what can they be doing inside i wish henry was out to enjoy this this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house it s very hard
p01951_B,01951,B,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while
p01952_B,01952,B,meg is or isn t he ill i can t make out
p01953_B,01953,B,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing
p01954_B,01954,B,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle
p01955_B,01955,B,dreadfully that is why i wish dolly had not come too to day still he wanted them all to come it has to be
p01956_B,01956,B,why does he want them meg may i tell you something i like henry
p01957_B,01957,B,you d be odd if you didn t
p01958_B,01958,B,i usen t to
p01959_B,01959,B,usen t
p01960_B,01960,B,i like henry because he does worry
p01961_B,01961,B,and he likes you because you don t
p01962_B,01962,B,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree
p01963_B,01963,B,i do not agree i do not
p01964_B,01964,B,i ought to remember leonard as my lover i tempted him and killed him and it is surely the least i can do i would like to throw out all my heart to leonard on such an afternoon as this but i cannot it is no good pretending i am forgetting him how nothing seems to match how my darling my precious
p01965_B,01965,B,baby s not to try and stand there s something wanting in me i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least but i is it some awful appalling criminal defect
p01966_B,01966,B,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p01967_B,01967,B,yes yes but what has leonard got out of life
p01968_B,01968,B,perhaps an adventure
p01969_B,01969,B,is that enough
p01970_B,01970,B,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet
p01971_B,01971,B,no only withered
p01972_B,01972,B,it will sweeten to morrow
p01973_B,01973,B,oh meg you are a person think of the racket and torture this time last year but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried what a change and all through you
p01974_B,01974,B,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter
p01975_B,01975,B,yes but who settled us down you you did it all sweetest though you re too stupid to see living here was your plan i wanted you he wanted you and everyone said it was impossible but you knew just think of our lives without you meg i and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie but you picked up the pieces and made us a home can t it strike you even for a moment that your life has been heroic can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest when you began to act and did all
p01976_B,01976,B,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me
p01977_B,01977,B,i hope it will be permanent
p01978_B,01978,B,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own
p01979_B,01979,B,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past
p01980_B,01980,B,oh take care
p01981_B,01981,B,the conclave s breaking at last i ll go

p01984_B,01984,B,i beg your pardon my boy you have only to speak and i will leave the house to you instead
p01985_B,01985,B,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it s no good my settling down here it s not really the country and it s not the town
p01986_B,01986,B,very well does my arrangement suit you evie
p01987_B,01987,B,of course father
p01988_B,01988,B,and you dolly
p01989_B,01989,B,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p01990_B,01990,B,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely and let everyone understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise in consequence i leave my wife no money that is her own wish all that she would have had will be divided among you i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me that is her wish too she also is giving away a great deal of money she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew down in the field is all that clear does everyone understand
p01991_B,01991,B,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included

p02002_B,02002,B,you didn t darling nothing has been done wrong
p02003_B,02003,B,here they are at last
