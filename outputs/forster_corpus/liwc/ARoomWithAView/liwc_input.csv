p00000_A,00000,A,the signora had no business to do it no business at all she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart oh lucy
p00001_A,00001,A,and a cockney besides it might be london charlotte don t you feel too that we might be in london i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside i suppose it is one s being so tired
p00002_A,00002,A,this meat has surely been used for soup
p00003_A,00003,A,i want so to see the arno the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno the signora had no business to do it at all oh it is a shame
p00004_A,00004,A,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p00005_A,00005,A,charlotte you mustn t spoil me of course you must look over the arno too i meant that the first vacant room in the front
p00006_A,00006,A,you must have it
p00007_A,00007,A,no no you must have it
p00008_A,00008,A,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p00009_A,00009,A,i have a view i have a view
p00010_A,00010,A,a view oh a view how delightful a view is
p00011_A,00011,A,this is my son his name s george he has a view too
p00012_A,00012,A,ah
p00013_A,00013,A,what i mean is that you can have our rooms and we ll have yours we ll change
p00014_A,00014,A,thank you very much indeed that is out of the question
p00015_A,00015,A,why
p00016_A,00016,A,because it is quite out of the question thank you
p00017_A,00017,A,you see we don t like to take
p00018_A,00018,A,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00019_A,00019,A,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00020_A,00020,A,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p00021_A,00021,A,oh oh why it s mr beebe oh how perfectly lovely oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are oh
p00022_A,00022,A,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p00023_A,00023,A,i am so glad to see you just fancy how small the world is summer street too makes it so specially funny
p00024_A,00024,A,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p00025_A,00025,A,yes i heard from mother so last week she didn t know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr beebe is
p00026_A,00026,A,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p00027_A,00027,A,oh how glad i am the name of our house is windy corner there is mother and me generally and my brother though it s not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean
p00028_A,00028,A,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p00029_A,00029,A,don t neglect the country round the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort
p00030_A,00030,A,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p00031_A,00031,A,prato they must go to prato that place is too sweetly squalid for words i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know
p00032_A,00032,A,we are most grateful to you the first evening means so much when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d heure do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner
p00033_A,00033,A,emerson
p00034_A,00034,A,is he a friend of yours
p00035_A,00035,A,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p00036_A,00036,A,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p00037_A,00037,A,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p00038_A,00038,A,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p00039_A,00039,A,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p00040_A,00040,A,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00041_A,00041,A,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p00042_A,00042,A,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p00043_A,00043,A,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p00044_A,00044,A,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p00045_A,00045,A,not at all i never suggested that
p00046_A,00046,A,was i a bore why didn t you talk lucy he prefers young people i m sure i do hope i haven t monopolized him i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinner time
p00047_A,00047,A,he is nice just what i remember he seems to see good in everyone no one would take him for a clergyman
p00048_A,00048,A,my dear lucia
p00049_A,00049,A,well you know what i mean and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man
p00050_A,00050,A,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p00051_A,00051,A,i m sure she will and so will freddy
p00052_A,00052,A,i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times
p00053_A,00053,A,yes
p00054_A,00054,A,i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion
p00055_A,00055,A,but here you are as safe as in england signora bertolini is so english
p00056_A,00056,A,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p00057_A,00057,A,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p00058_A,00058,A,i think he was meaning to be kind
p00059_A,00059,A,undoubtedly he was
p00060_A,00060,A,mr beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature of course i was holding back on my cousin s account about old mr emerson i hardly know no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same time beautiful
p00061_A,00061,A,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p00062_A,00062,A,miss bartlett it s all right about the rooms i m so glad mr emerson was talking about it in the smoking room and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again he has let me come and ask you he would be so pleased
p00063_A,00063,A,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p00064_A,00064,A,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p00065_A,00065,A,mr emerson is engaged but here is his son instead
p00066_A,00066,A,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p00067_A,00067,A,poor young man
p00068_A,00068,A,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00069_A,00069,A,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00070_A,00070,A,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p00071_A,00071,A,how you do do everything
p00072_A,00072,A,naturally dear it is my affair
p00073_A,00073,A,but i would like to help you
p00074_A,00074,A,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p00075_A,00075,A,mother wouldn t mind i m sure
p00076_A,00076,A,a smell a true florentine smell every city let me teach you has its own smell
p00077_A,00077,A,is it a very nice smell
p00078_A,00078,A,one doesn t come to italy for niceness one comes for life buon giorno buon giorno look at that adorable wine cart how the driver stares at us dear simple soul buon giorno take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors that is the true democracy though i am a real radical as well there now you re shocked
p00079_A,00079,A,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland
p00080_A,00080,A,i see i see and now you have gone over to the enemy
p00081_A,00081,A,oh please if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp
p00082_A,00082,A,shameful a manufacturing district i suppose
p00083_A,00083,A,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p00084_A,00084,A,what a delightful part i know it so well it is full of the very nicest people do you know sir harry otway a radical if ever there was
p00085_A,00085,A,very well indeed
p00086_A,00086,A,and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist
p00087_A,00087,A,why she rents a field of us how funny
p00088_A,00088,A,oh you have property in surrey
p00089_A,00089,A,hardly any only thirty acres just the garden all downhill and some fields
p00090_A,00090,A,bless us bless us and save us we ve lost the way lost lost my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us what are we to do two lone females in an unknown town now this is what i call an adventure oh but that is the word of a craven and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker give it to me i shan t let you carry it we will simply drift stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them i do detest conventional intercourse nasty they are going into the church too oh the britisher abroad
p00091_A,00091,A,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p00092_A,00092,A,look at their figures they walk through my italy like a pair of cows it s very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldn t pass it
p00093_A,00093,A,what would you ask us
p00094_A,00094,A,you are a clever woman you have done more than all the relics in the world i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellow creatures happy there is no scheme of the universe
p00095_A,00095,A,niente
p00096_A,00096,A,i m not sure she understands english
p00097_A,00097,A,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p00098_A,00098,A,no i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the door it is too bad she simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself
p00099_A,00099,A,why shouldn t you
p00100_A,00100,A,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00101_A,00101,A,but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker
p00102_A,00102,A,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00103_A,00103,A,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00104_A,00104,A,thank you very much but i could not think of that i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience
p00105_A,00105,A,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00106_A,00106,A,i am not touchy i hope it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are
p00107_A,00107,A,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p00108_A,00108,A,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p00109_A,00109,A,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p00110_A,00110,A,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p00111_A,00111,A,pardon me the chapel is somewhat small for two parties we will incommode you no longer
p00112_A,00112,A,george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate
p00113_A,00113,A,perhaps he is i don t remember
p00114_A,00114,A,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p00115_A,00115,A,my father has that effect on nearly everyone he will try to be kind
p00116_A,00116,A,i hope we all try
p00117_A,00117,A,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p00118_A,00118,A,how silly of them i think that a kind action done tactfully
p00119_A,00119,A,were you snubbed
p00120_A,00120,A,don t let us spoil yours have you looked at those saints
p00121_A,00121,A,yes they are lovely do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin
p00122_A,00122,A,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p00123_A,00123,A,i like giotto it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values though i like things like the della robbia babies better
p00124_A,00124,A,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p00125_A,00125,A,oh dear
p00126_A,00126,A,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p00127_A,00127,A,and what is it
p00128_A,00128,A,the old trouble things won t fit
p00129_A,00129,A,what things
p00130_A,00130,A,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p00131_A,00131,A,oh mr emerson whatever do you mean
p00132_A,00132,A,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p00133_A,00133,A,miss bartlett
p00134_A,00134,A,oh good gracious me where where
p00135_A,00135,A,in the nave
p00136_A,00136,A,i see those gossiping little miss alans must have
p00137_A,00137,A,poor girl poor girl
p00138_A,00138,A,who is she
p00139_A,00139,A,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p00140_A,00140,A,introduce me
p00141_A,00141,A,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p00142_A,00142,A,oh what a funny thing some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet
p00143_A,00143,A,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p00144_A,00144,A,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p00145_A,00145,A,of course
p00146_A,00146,A,music
p00147_A,00147,A,what about music
p00148_A,00148,A,poor charlotte will be sopped
p00149_A,00149,A,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p00150_A,00150,A,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p00151_A,00151,A,they do say so
p00152_A,00152,A,what is it about
p00153_A,00153,A,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p00154_A,00154,A,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p00155_A,00155,A,fa niente sono vecchia
p00156_A,00156,A,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00157_A,00157,A,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p00158_A,00158,A,what was that
p00159_A,00159,A,let me finish the story miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said she went at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience
p00160_A,00160,A,whatever happened
p00161_A,00161,A,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p00162_A,00162,A,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p00163_A,00163,A,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p00164_A,00164,A,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p00165_A,00165,A,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p00166_A,00166,A,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p00167_A,00167,A,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p00168_A,00168,A,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00169_A,00169,A,italians dear you know
p00170_A,00170,A,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p00171_A,00171,A,oh what have i done
p00172_A,00172,A,you fainted
p00173_A,00173,A,i i am very sorry

p00177_A,00177,A,how very kind you have been i might have hurt myself falling but now i am well i can go alone thank you oh my photographs
p00178_A,00178,A,what photographs
p00179_A,00179,A,i bought some photographs at alinari s i must have dropped them out there in the square would you add to your kindness by fetching them
p00180_A,00180,A,miss honeychurch you sit still you aren t fit to go home alone
p00181_A,00181,A,yes i am thank you so very much
p00182_A,00182,A,no you aren t you d go openly if you were
p00183_A,00183,A,but i had rather
p00184_A,00184,A,then i don t fetch your photographs
p00185_A,00185,A,i had rather be alone
p00186_A,00186,A,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p00187_A,00187,A,and the murderer tried to kiss him you say how very odd italians are and gave himself up to the police mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterday what was that what did you throw in
p00188_A,00188,A,things i didn t want
p00189_A,00189,A,mr emerson
p00190_A,00190,A,well
p00191_A,00191,A,where are the photographs i believe it was my photographs that you threw away
p00192_A,00192,A,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p00193_A,00193,A,mr emerson
p00194_A,00194,A,i want to ask you something before we go in
p00195_A,00195,A,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p00196_A,00196,A,i nearly fainted myself
p00197_A,00197,A,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p00198_A,00198,A,oh all right
p00199_A,00199,A,and this is the real point you know how silly people are gossiping ladies especially i am afraid you understand what i mean
p00200_A,00200,A,i m afraid i don t
p00201_A,00201,A,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p00202_A,00202,A,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p00203_A,00203,A,thank you so much and would you well thank you so much how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life
p00204_A,00204,A,i don t i shall probably want to live
p00205_A,00205,A,but why mr emerson what do you mean
p00206_A,00206,A,no charlotte it s very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you i had much rather
p00207_A,00207,A,oh let me congratulate you after your despair of yesterday what a fortunate thing
p00208_A,00208,A,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p00209_A,00209,A,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00210_A,00210,A,it is i who am sorry literary hacks are shameless creatures i believe there s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn t pry
p00211_A,00211,A,what is the heroine s name
p00212_A,00212,A,leonora
p00213_A,00213,A,i do hope she s nice and what is the plot
p00214_A,00214,A,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p00215_A,00215,A,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p00216_A,00216,A,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p00217_A,00217,A,she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word none but the superficial would be shocked at her we had a long talk yesterday she believes in justice and truth and human interest she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman mr eager why how nice what a pleasant surprise
p00218_A,00218,A,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p00219_A,00219,A,we were chatting to miss lavish
p00220_A,00220,A,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p00221_A,00221,A,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p00222_A,00222,A,and how came we to have you here
p00223_A,00223,A,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned
p00224_A,00224,A,so you were here alone miss honeychurch
p00225_A,00225,A,practically
p00226_A,00226,A,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p00227_A,00227,A,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p00228_A,00228,A,he died by the fountain i believe
p00229_A,00229,A,and you and your friend
p00230_A,00230,A,were over at the loggia
p00231_A,00231,A,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p00232_A,00232,A,willingly would i purchase
p00233_A,00233,A,ignore him
p00234_A,00234,A,how wonderfully people rise in these days
p00235_A,00235,A,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p00236_A,00236,A,is he a journalist now
p00237_A,00237,A,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p00238_A,00238,A,oh so he has a wife
p00239_A,00239,A,dead miss bartlett dead i wonder yes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me he was in my london parish long ago the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him let him beware that he does not get more than a snub
p00240_A,00240,A,what
p00241_A,00241,A,exposure
p00242_A,00242,A,do you mean that he is an irreligious man we know that already
p00243_A,00243,A,lucy dear
p00244_A,00244,A,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p00245_A,00245,A,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p00246_A,00246,A,to speak plainly it is i will say no more
p00247_A,00247,A,you have said very little
p00248_A,00248,A,it was my intention to say very little murder if you want to know that man murdered his wife
p00249_A,00249,A,how
p00250_A,00250,A,to all intents and purposes he murdered her that day in santa croce did they say anything against me
p00251_A,00251,A,not a word mr eager not a single word
p00252_A,00252,A,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p00253_A,00253,A,i m not defending them they re nothing to me
p00254_A,00254,A,i must be going
p00255_A,00255,A,bother the drive it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all why should he invite us in that absurd manner we might as well invite him we are each paying for ourselves
p00256_A,00256,A,if that is so dear if the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish
p00257_A,00257,A,how
p00258_A,00258,A,because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too
p00259_A,00259,A,that will mean another carriage
p00260_A,00260,A,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p00261_A,00261,A,it is indeed
p00262_A,00262,A,what do you think about it
p00263_A,00263,A,i don t know what i think nor what i want
p00264_A,00264,A,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p00265_A,00265,A,thank you charlotte
p00266_A,00266,A,and the news
p00267_A,00267,A,mrs vyse and her son have gone to rome do you know the vyses
p00268_A,00268,A,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p00269_A,00269,A,they re nice people the vyses so clever my idea of what s really clever don t you long to be in rome
p00270_A,00270,A,i die for it
p00271_A,00271,A,charlotte here s an idea what if we popped off to rome to morrow straight to the vyses hotel for i do know what i want i m sick of florence no you said you d go to the ends of the earth do do
p00272_A,00272,A,so miss honeychurch you are travelling as a student of art
p00273_A,00273,A,oh dear me no oh no
p00274_A,00274,A,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00275_A,00275,A,oh no i am here as a tourist
p00276_A,00276,A,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p00277_A,00277,A,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p00278_A,00278,A,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p00279_A,00279,A,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day
p00280_A,00280,A,piano piano
p00281_A,00281,A,va bene signore va bene va bene she is my sister
p00282_A,00282,A,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure
p00283_A,00283,A,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p00284_A,00284,A,signorina
p00285_A,00285,A,signorina
p00286_A,00286,A,victory at last
p00287_A,00287,A,it is not victory it is defeat you have parted two people who were happy we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it we have no rights over his soul
p00288_A,00288,A,he was not driving us well he jolted us
p00289_A,00289,A,that i deny it was as restful as sleeping aha he is jolting us now can you wonder he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified and if i were superstitious i d be frightened of the girl too it doesn t do to injure young people have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici
p00290_A,00290,A,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature
p00291_A,00291,A,the lord knows possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet he wrote a line so i heard yesterday which runs like this don t go fighting against the spring
p00292_A,00292,A,would render a correct meaning
p00293_A,00293,A,the railway oh but i shall die of course it was the railway he is the image of a porter on on the south eastern
p00294_A,00294,A,i can t stop let me go my wicked way a porter
p00295_A,00295,A,i m sure it s all right the emersons won t hear and they wouldn t mind if they did
p00296_A,00296,A,miss honeychurch listening pouf wouf you naughty girl go away
p00297_A,00297,A,oh lucy you ought to be with mr eager i m sure
p00298_A,00298,A,i can t find them now and i don t want to either
p00299_A,00299,A,mr eager will be offended it is your party
p00300_A,00300,A,please i d rather stop here with you
p00301_A,00301,A,no i agree it s like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls miss lucy you are to go we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear
p00302_A,00302,A,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p00303_A,00303,A,then sit you down observe my foresight
p00304_A,00304,A,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p00305_A,00305,A,would she like to see them
p00306_A,00306,A,ma buoni uomini what is that
p00307_A,00307,A,let us go immediately the signorino will walk
p00308_A,00308,A,all the way he will be hours
p00309_A,00309,A,apparently i told him it was unwise
p00310_A,00310,A,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p00311_A,00311,A,no of course
p00312_A,00312,A,mr eager we want your assistance will you interpret for us
p00313_A,00313,A,george ask your driver which way george went the boy may lose his way he may be killed
p00314_A,00314,A,he may be killed he may be killed
p00315_A,00315,A,typical behaviour in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down
p00316_A,00316,A,what does he know charlotte how much does mr eager know
p00317_A,00317,A,silenzio
p00318_A,00318,A,va bene
p00319_A,00319,A,charlotte dear charlotte kiss me kiss me again only you can understand me you warned me to be careful and i i thought i was developing
p00320_A,00320,A,do not cry dearest take your time
p00321_A,00321,A,i have been obstinate and silly worse than you know far worse once by the river oh but he isn t killed he wouldn t be killed would he
p00322_A,00322,A,i trust not one would always pray against that
p00323_A,00323,A,he is really i think he was taken by surprise just as i was before but this time i m not to blame i want you to believe that i simply slipped into those violets no i want to be really truthful i am a little to blame i had silly thoughts the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book
p00324_A,00324,A,in a book
p00325_A,00325,A,heroes gods the nonsense of schoolgirls
p00326_A,00326,A,and then
p00327_A,00327,A,but charlotte you know what happened then i want to be truthful it is so hard to be absolutely truthful
p00328_A,00328,A,don t be troubled dearest wait till you are calmer we will talk it over before bed time in my room
p00329_A,00329,A,well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair so what is to be done what is to be done a point dearest which you alone can settle
p00330_A,00330,A,it has been raining for nearly four hours
p00331_A,00331,A,how do you propose to silence him
p00332_A,00332,A,the driver
p00333_A,00333,A,my dear girl no mr george emerson
p00334_A,00334,A,i don t understand
p00335_A,00335,A,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p00336_A,00336,A,i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do
p00337_A,00337,A,i too intend to judge him charitably but unfortunately i have met the type before they seldom keep their exploits to themselves
p00338_A,00338,A,exploits
p00339_A,00339,A,my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first come here and listen to me i am only gathering it from his own remarks do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another well i am no prude there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish but we are no farther on with our question what do you propose to do
p00340_A,00340,A,i propose to speak to him you see charlotte your kindness i shall never forget it but as you said it is my affair mine and his
p00341_A,00341,A,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p00342_A,00342,A,certainly not there would be no difficulty whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over i have been frightened of him but now i am not one little bit
p00343_A,00343,A,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p00344_A,00344,A,i can t think
p00345_A,00345,A,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p00346_A,00346,A,i can t think
p00347_A,00347,A,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p00348_A,00348,A,i hadn t time to think you came
p00349_A,00349,A,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done
p00350_A,00350,A,i should have
p00351_A,00351,A,come away from the window dear you will be seen from the road oh for a real man we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless there is mr eager but you do not trust him oh for your brother he is young but i know that his sister s insult would rouse in him a very lion thank god chivalry is not yet dead there are still left some men who can reverence woman it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try
p00352_A,00352,A,what train
p00353_A,00353,A,the train to rome
p00354_A,00354,A,when does the train to rome go
p00355_A,00355,A,at eight
p00356_A,00356,A,signora bertolini would be upset
p00357_A,00357,A,we must face that
p00358_A,00358,A,she will make us pay for a whole week s pension
p00359_A,00359,A,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p00360_A,00360,A,yes but they pay extra for wine
p00361_A,00361,A,dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me
p00362_A,00362,A,charlotte dear what do you mean as if i have anything to forgive
p00363_A,00363,A,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p00364_A,00364,A,but no
p00365_A,00365,A,ah but yes i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped i might have known it would not do you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you i am too uninteresting and old fashioned only fit to pack and unpack your things
p00366_A,00366,A,please
p00367_A,00367,A,my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary you had your own way about these rooms at all events
p00368_A,00368,A,you mustn t say these things
p00369_A,00369,A,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p00370_A,00370,A,but mother will understand it is not your fault this trouble and it isn t a disaster either
p00371_A,00371,A,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p00372_A,00372,A,every right
p00373_A,00373,A,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p00374_A,00374,A,why need mother hear of it
p00375_A,00375,A,but you tell her everything
p00376_A,00376,A,i suppose i do generally
p00377_A,00377,A,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p00378_A,00378,A,naturally i should have told her but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to i will never speak of it either to her or to any one
p00379_A,00379,A,where aren t they i tell you i m getting fairly sick
p00380_A,00380,A,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p00381_A,00381,A,time they did
p00382_A,00382,A,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p00383_A,00383,A,it s his third go isn t it
p00384_A,00384,A,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00385_A,00385,A,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p00386_A,00386,A,do you indeed dear how interesting
p00387_A,00387,A,i feel never mind
p00388_A,00388,A,just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse i said dear mrs vyse
p00389_A,00389,A,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p00390_A,00390,A,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me
p00391_A,00391,A,nor me
p00392_A,00392,A,you what do you mean
p00393_A,00393,A,he asked me for my permission also
p00394_A,00394,A,how very odd of him
p00395_A,00395,A,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p00396_A,00396,A,what do you know about lucy or girls or anything what ever did you say
p00397_A,00397,A,i said to cecil
p00398_A,00398,A,what a helpful answer
p00399_A,00399,A,the bother is this
p00400_A,00400,A,freddy you must come there they still are
p00401_A,00401,A,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p00402_A,00402,A,peeping like that can t i look out of my own window still page 322
p00403_A,00403,A,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p00404_A,00404,A,i hope you gave a careful answer dear
p00405_A,00405,A,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p00406_A,00406,A,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p00407_A,00407,A,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p00408_A,00408,A,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p00409_A,00409,A,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p00410_A,00410,A,well i like him i know his mother he s good he s clever he s rich he s well connected oh you needn t kick the piano he s well connected i ll say it again if you like he s well connected and he has beautiful manners
p00411_A,00411,A,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p00412_A,00412,A,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p00413_A,00413,A,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p00414_A,00414,A,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p00415_A,00415,A,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p00416_A,00416,A,don t interrupt so foolishly where was i oh yes no i ll cross that last bit out it looks patronizing i ll stop at or shall i cross that out too
p00417_A,00417,A,cross it out too
p00418_A,00418,A,then the whole thing runs
p00419_A,00419,A,look out
p00420_A,00420,A,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me
p00421_A,00421,A,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p00422_A,00422,A,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy
p00423_A,00423,A,i hope so
p00424_A,00424,A,we mothers
p00425_A,00425,A,i say lucy
p00426_A,00426,A,steady on
p00427_A,00427,A,not a kiss for me
p00428_A,00428,A,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p00429_A,00429,A,we go with lucy
p00430_A,00430,A,mr beebe
p00431_A,00431,A,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p00432_A,00432,A,i should say so food is the thing one does get here don t sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it
p00433_A,00433,A,pfui
p00434_A,00434,A,i know i know i can t think why mrs honeychurch allows it
p00435_A,00435,A,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p00436_A,00436,A,news i don t understand you news
p00437_A,00437,A,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p00438_A,00438,A,has he indeed
p00439_A,00439,A,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p00440_A,00440,A,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p00441_A,00441,A,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p00442_A,00442,A,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p00443_A,00443,A,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p00444_A,00444,A,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p00445_A,00445,A,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p00446_A,00446,A,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p00447_A,00447,A,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p00448_A,00448,A,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p00449_A,00449,A,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p00450_A,00450,A,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p00451_A,00451,A,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p00452_A,00452,A,she has none
p00453_A,00453,A,i quite agree at present she has none
p00454_A,00454,A,at present
p00455_A,00455,A,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p00456_A,00456,A,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p00457_A,00457,A,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p00458_A,00458,A,in what way
p00459_A,00459,A,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p00460_A,00460,A,but the string never broke
p00461_A,00461,A,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p00462_A,00462,A,it has broken now
p00463_A,00463,A,broken what do you mean
p00464_A,00464,A,i meant that she is going to marry me
p00465_A,00465,A,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p00466_A,00466,A,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p00467_A,00467,A,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p00468_A,00468,A,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p00469_A,00469,A,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p00470_A,00470,A,have you heard oh mr beebe have you heard the news
p00471_A,00471,A,indeed i have mrs honeychurch i m going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally i m too shy i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother and now i want my tea
p00472_A,00472,A,you only asked for it just in time how dare you be serious at windy corner
p00473_A,00473,A,fiasco
p00474_A,00474,A,do you go to much of this sort of thing
p00475_A,00475,A,oh now and then
p00476_A,00476,A,is it typical of country society
p00477_A,00477,A,i suppose so mother would it be
p00478_A,00478,A,plenty of society
p00479_A,00479,A,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p00480_A,00480,A,i am so sorry that you were stranded
p00481_A,00481,A,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p00482_A,00482,A,one has to go through it i suppose they won t notice us so much next time
p00483_A,00483,A,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p00484_A,00484,A,how tiresome couldn t you have escaped to tennis
p00485_A,00485,A,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p00486_A,00486,A,inglese italianato
p00487_A,00487,A,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p00488_A,00488,A,we all have our limitations i suppose
p00489_A,00489,A,sometimes they are forced on us though
p00490_A,00490,A,how
p00491_A,00491,A,difference i don t see any difference fences are fences especially when they are in the same place
p00492_A,00492,A,we were speaking of motives
p00493_A,00493,A,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p00494_A,00494,A,we weren t talking of real fences
p00495_A,00495,A,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p00496_A,00496,A,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p00497_A,00497,A,don t you like mr beebe
p00498_A,00498,A,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p00499_A,00499,A,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p00500_A,00500,A,what sort of things
p00501_A,00501,A,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p00502_A,00502,A,perhaps he had
p00503_A,00503,A,no
p00504_A,00504,A,why
p00505_A,00505,A,he was such a nice old man i m sure well i did try to sift the thing mr eager would never come to the point he prefers it vague said the old man had practically murdered his wife had murdered her in the sight of god
p00506_A,00506,A,hush dear poor old man what was his name
p00507_A,00507,A,harris
p00508_A,00508,A,let s hope that mrs harris there warn t no sich person
p00509_A,00509,A,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p00510_A,00510,A,i don t know i hate him i ve heard him lecture on giotto i hate him nothing can hide a petty nature i hate him
p00511_A,00511,A,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p00512_A,00512,A,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p00513_A,00513,A,what height
p00514_A,00514,A,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p00515_A,00515,A,summer street of course
p00516_A,00516,A,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p00517_A,00517,A,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p00518_A,00518,A,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p00519_A,00519,A,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p00520_A,00520,A,and all the capitals different one with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flack s initials everyone different
p00521_A,00521,A,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p00522_A,00522,A,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p00523_A,00523,A,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p00524_A,00524,A,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p00525_A,00525,A,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p00526_A,00526,A,yes i met them abroad
p00527_A,00527,A,gentlewomen
p00528_A,00528,A,yes indeed and at the present moment homeless i heard from them last week miss teresa and miss catharine alan i m really not joking they are quite the right people mr beebe knows them too may i tell them to write to you
p00529_A,00529,A,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p00530_A,00530,A,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p00531_A,00531,A,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p00532_A,00532,A,the misses alan aren t that
p00533_A,00533,A,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p00534_A,00534,A,don t listen to him sir harry he s tiresome
p00535_A,00535,A,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p00536_A,00536,A,then may i write to my misses alan
p00537_A,00537,A,please
p00538_A,00538,A,beware they are certain to have canaries sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come beware of women altogether only let to a man
p00539_A,00539,A,really
p00540_A,00540,A,men don t gossip over tea cups if they get drunk there s an end of them they lie down comfortably and sleep it off if they re vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves it doesn t spread so give me a man of course provided he s clean
p00541_A,00541,A,mrs honeychurch what if we two walk home and leave you
p00542_A,00542,A,certainly
p00543_A,00543,A,aha young people young people
p00544_A,00544,A,hopeless vulgarian
p00545_A,00545,A,oh cecil
p00546_A,00546,A,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p00547_A,00547,A,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p00548_A,00548,A,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p00549_A,00549,A,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p00550_A,00550,A,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p00551_A,00551,A,which way shall we go
p00552_A,00552,A,are there two ways
p00553_A,00553,A,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p00554_A,00554,A,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p00555_A,00555,A,haven t i the wood then
p00556_A,00556,A,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p00557_A,00557,A,a room
p00558_A,00558,A,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p00559_A,00559,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p00560_A,00560,A,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p00561_A,00561,A,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p00562_A,00562,A,a drawing room pray with no view
p00563_A,00563,A,yes with no view i fancy why not
p00564_A,00564,A,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p00565_A,00565,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p00566_A,00566,A,why do you call it that
p00567_A,00567,A,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p00568_A,00568,A,and you
p00569_A,00569,A,i bathed here too till i was found out then there was a row

p00612_A,00612,A,i don t know whether they re any emersons
p00613_A,00613,A,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p00614_A,00614,A,emerson s a common enough name
p00615_A,00615,A,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p00616_A,00616,A,oh yes and you will be satisfied too for they re friends of cecil so you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety
p00617_A,00617,A,cecil
p00618_A,00618,A,don t be rude dear lucy don t screech it s a new bad habit you re getting into
p00619_A,00619,A,but has cecil
p00620_A,00620,A,friends of cecil s
p00621_A,00621,A,but cecil s emersons they can t possibly be the same ones there is that
p00622_A,00622,A,there was a great scene over some violets they picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have failed to come to cissie villa poor little ladies so shocked and so pleased it used to be one of miss catharine s great stories it began they found the whole room a mass of blue vases and jugs and the story ends with it is all very difficult yes i always connect those florentine emersons with violets
p00623_A,00623,A,fiasco s done you this time
p00624_A,00624,A,these particular emersons consisted of a father and a son the son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immature pessimism et cetera our special joy was the father such a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife
p00625_A,00625,A,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time
p00626_A,00626,A,i must go don t be silly you always overdo it when you play
p00627_A,00627,A,harris
p00628_A,00628,A,cecil
p00629_A,00629,A,hullo i was hoping you d come i heard you all bear gardening but there s better fun up here i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse george meredith s right the cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa don t be angry don t be angry you ll forgive me when you hear it all
p00630_A,00630,A,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p00631_A,00631,A,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p00632_A,00632,A,what an odd place to meet people i don t quite understand
p00633_A,00633,A,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p00634_A,00634,A,but cecil
p00635_A,00635,A,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p00636_A,00636,A,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before
p00637_A,00637,A,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p00638_A,00638,A,no you don t you don t know what the word means
p00639_A,00639,A,no you don t
p00640_A,00640,A,it isn t fair cecil i blame you i blame you very much indeed you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense i consider it most disloyal of you
p00641_A,00641,A,cecil cecil darling
p00642_A,00642,A,so you do love me little thing
p00643_A,00643,A,oh cecil i do i do i don t know what i should do without you
p00644_A,00644,A,now some beethoven
p00645_A,00645,A,make lucy one of us lucy is becoming wonderful wonderful
p00646_A,00646,A,her music always was wonderful
p00647_A,00647,A,yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made
p00648_A,00648,A,italy has done it
p00649_A,00649,A,perhaps it is just possible cecil mind you marry her next january she is one of us already
p00650_A,00650,A,but her music the style of her how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven schumann was right for this evening schumann was the thing do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and then not till then let them come to london i don t believe in these london educations at all events not for women
p00651_A,00651,A,i am so sorry mrs vyse it is these dreams
p00652_A,00652,A,bad dreams
p00653_A,00653,A,just dreams

p00658_A,00658,A,are these people great readers are they that sort
p00659_A,00659,A,i fancy they know how to read a rare accomplishment what have they got byron exactly a shropshire lad never heard of it the way of all flesh never heard of it gibbon hullo dear george reads german um um schopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch
p00660_A,00660,A,mr beebe look at that
p00661_A,00661,A,i know isn t it jolly i like that i m certain that s the old man s doing
p00662_A,00662,A,how very odd of him
p00663_A,00663,A,surely you agree pictures giotto they got that at florence i ll be bound
p00664_A,00664,A,the same as lucy s got
p00665_A,00665,A,oh by the by did miss honeychurch enjoy london
p00666_A,00666,A,she came back yesterday
p00667_A,00667,A,i suppose she had a good time
p00668_A,00668,A,yes very she and cecil are thicker than ever
p00669_A,00669,A,that s good hearing
p00670_A,00670,A,i wish i wasn t such a fool mr beebe lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but it ll be very different now mother thinks she will read all kinds of books
p00671_A,00671,A,so will you
p00672_A,00672,A,only medical books not books that you can talk about afterwards cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed cecil says
p00673_A,00673,A,let me introduce mr honeychurch a neighbour
p00674_A,00674,A,how d ye do come and have a bathe
p00675_A,00675,A,oh all right
p00676_A,00676,A,i tell you that they shall be good afternoon mr beebe i tell you they shall be comrades and george thinks the same
p00677_A,00677,A,we are to raise ladies to our level
p00678_A,00678,A,the garden of eden which you place in the past is really yet to come we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies in this not in other things we men are ahead we despise the body less than women do but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden
p00679_A,00679,A,i say what about this bathe
p00680_A,00680,A,i believed in a return to nature once but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her to day i believe that we must discover nature after many conquests we shall attain simplicity it is our heritage
p00681_A,00681,A,let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence
p00682_A,00682,A,how do you do very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry marriage is a duty i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too he has been most kind he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude ah this wind you do well to bathe yours is a glorious country honeychurch
p00683_A,00683,A,not a bit i must that is to say i have to have the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope
p00684_A,00684,A,call my lad who taught us that drawing room twaddle call on your grandmother listen to the wind among the pines yours is a glorious country
p00685_A,00685,A,mr emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval it does not count that i helped you with the stair eyes yesterday it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon
p00686_A,00686,A,yes go and bathe george why do you dawdle talking bring them back to tea bring back some milk cakes honey the change will do you good george has been working very hard at his office i can t believe he s well
p00687_A,00687,A,do you really want this bathe it is only a pond don t you know i dare say you are used to something better
p00688_A,00688,A,and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here
p00689_A,00689,A,i did not miss lavish told me
p00690_A,00690,A,when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose for example it isn t purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect
p00691_A,00691,A,it is i have reflected it is fate everything is fate we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fate flung together drawn apart the twelve winds blow us we settle nothing
p00692_A,00692,A,you have not reflected at all
p00693_A,00693,A,italy
p00694_A,00694,A,and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch
p00695_A,00695,A,national gallery
p00696_A,00696,A,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p00697_A,00697,A,it is fate that i am here but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy
p00698_A,00698,A,and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write we are all so glad that you have come
p00699_A,00699,A,here we are
p00700_A,00700,A,oh good
p00701_A,00701,A,in there s the pond i wish it was bigger

p00731_A,00731,A,lucy is anything the matter with cecil
p00732_A,00732,A,no i don t think so mother cecil s all right
p00733_A,00733,A,perhaps he s tired because otherwise because otherwise i cannot account for him
p00734_A,00734,A,i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that
p00735_A,00735,A,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p00736_A,00736,A,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p00737_A,00737,A,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p00738_A,00738,A,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p00739_A,00739,A,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p00740_A,00740,A,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p00741_A,00741,A,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p00742_A,00742,A,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p00743_A,00743,A,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p00744_A,00744,A,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p00745_A,00745,A,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p00746_A,00746,A,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p00747_A,00747,A,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p00748_A,00748,A,we mustn t be unjust to people
p00749_A,00749,A,go and dress dear you ll be late
p00750_A,00750,A,all right mother
p00751_A,00751,A,don t say and stop go
p00752_A,00752,A,i say those are topping people
p00753_A,00753,A,my dear baby how tiresome you ve been you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake it s much too public it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else do be more careful you forget the place is growing half suburban
p00754_A,00754,A,i say is anything on to morrow week
p00755_A,00755,A,not that i know of
p00756_A,00756,A,then i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis
p00757_A,00757,A,oh i wouldn t do that freddy i wouldn t do that with all this muddle
p00758_A,00758,A,what s wrong with the court they won t mind a bump or two and i ve ordered new balls
p00759_A,00759,A,lucy what a noise you re making i have something to say to you did you say you had had a letter from charlotte
p00760_A,00760,A,yes i really can t stop i must dress too
p00761_A,00761,A,how s charlotte
p00762_A,00762,A,all right
p00763_A,00763,A,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p00764_A,00764,A,her what
p00765_A,00765,A,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p00766_A,00766,A,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p00767_A,00767,A,lucy what s emerson like
p00768_A,00768,A,i saw him in florence
p00769_A,00769,A,is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap
p00770_A,00770,A,ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here
p00771_A,00771,A,he is the clever sort like myself
p00772_A,00772,A,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p00773_A,00773,A,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p00774_A,00774,A,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p00775_A,00775,A,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p00776_A,00776,A,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00777_A,00777,A,she was a novelist
p00778_A,00778,A,this year next year now never
p00779_A,00779,A,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p00780_A,00780,A,i tore the thing up
p00781_A,00781,A,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p00782_A,00782,A,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p00783_A,00783,A,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p00784_A,00784,A,so would i
p00785_A,00785,A,and i have been thinking surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at tunbridge wells finish i have not seen poor charlotte for so long
p00786_A,00786,A,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p00787_A,00787,A,nonsense it can
p00788_A,00788,A,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p00789_A,00789,A,minnie can sleep with you
p00790_A,00790,A,i won t have her
p00791_A,00791,A,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p00792_A,00792,A,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett
p00793_A,00793,A,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p00794_A,00794,A,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p00795_A,00795,A,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p00796_A,00796,A,hear hear
p00797_A,00797,A,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p00798_A,00798,A,i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right
p00799_A,00799,A,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p00800_A,00800,A,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p00801_A,00801,A,from your own account you told her as much
p00802_A,00802,A,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p00803_A,00803,A,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p00804_A,00804,A,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p00805_A,00805,A,a nice fellow he will work off his crudities in time i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully
p00806_A,00806,A,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p00807_A,00807,A,i shall never forgive myself i have upset everything bursting in on young people but i insist on paying for my cab up grant that at any rate
p00808_A,00808,A,just what i ve been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour
p00809_A,00809,A,i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor
p00810_A,00810,A,all right if you d really rather five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver
p00811_A,00811,A,but who am i to give the sovereign to
p00812_A,00812,A,let s leave it all till mother comes back
p00813_A,00813,A,no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts please please i know i am a sad spoil sport but it would make me wretched i should practically be robbing the one who lost
p00814_A,00814,A,freddy owes me fifteen shillings so it will work out right if you give the pound to me
p00815_A,00815,A,fifteen shillings how is that mr vyse
p00816_A,00816,A,because don t you see freddy paid your cab give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling
p00817_A,00817,A,but i don t see that i don t see why mr vyse is to have the quid but i don t see no thank you i m done i don t see why freddy don t poke me miss honeychurch your brother s hurting me ow what about mr floyd s ten shillings ow no i don t see and i never shall see why miss what s her name shouldn t pay that bob for the driver
p00818_A,00818,A,i had forgotten the driver thank you dear for reminding me a shilling was it can any one give me change for half a crown
p00819_A,00819,A,i ll get it cecil give me that sovereign no give me up that sovereign i ll get euphemia to change it and we ll start the whole thing again from the beginning
p00820_A,00820,A,have you told him about him yet
p00821_A,00821,A,no i haven t let me see a sovereign s worth of silver no i haven t told cecil or any one i promised you i shouldn t here is your money all shillings except two half crowns would you count it you can settle your debt nicely now
p00822_A,00822,A,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p00823_A,00823,A,oh no charlotte george emerson is all right and what other source is there
p00824_A,00824,A,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p00825_A,00825,A,we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren t careful how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil
p00826_A,00826,A,we must think of every possibility
p00827_A,00827,A,oh it s all right
p00828_A,00828,A,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p00829_A,00829,A,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it
p00830_A,00830,A,to contradict it
p00831_A,00831,A,no to laugh at it
p00832_A,00832,A,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p00833_A,00833,A,now charlotte
p00834_A,00834,A,i am no match for you in conversation dearest i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am you will never forgive me
p00835_A,00835,A,shall we go out then they will smash all the china if we don t
p00836_A,00836,A,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p00837_A,00837,A,yes i have
p00838_A,00838,A,what happened
p00839_A,00839,A,we met at the rectory
p00840_A,00840,A,what line is he taking up
p00841_A,00841,A,no line he talked about italy like any other person it is really all right what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly i do wish i could make you see it my way he really won t be any nuisance charlotte
p00842_A,00842,A,once a cad always a cad that is my poor opinion
p00843_A,00843,A,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p00844_A,00844,A,once a cad always a cad
p00845_A,00845,A,well i don t blame them need she go
p00846_A,00846,A,lucy lucy what s that book who s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil
p00847_A,00847,A,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p00848_A,00848,A,it s a special collection i forget what for i do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that minnie has a nice bright sixpence where is the child minnie that book s all warped gracious how plain you look put it under the atlas to press minnie

p00852_A,00852,A,good bye be good
p00853_A,00853,A,very much we find though that the miss alans were coming and that we have turned them out women mind such a thing i am very much upset about it
p00854_A,00854,A,i believe that there was some misunderstanding
p00855_A,00855,A,and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up what do you think
p00856_A,00856,A,oh stop now you have come
p00857_A,00857,A,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p00858_A,00858,A,there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world
p00859_A,00859,A,yes that s exactly what i say why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans
p00860_A,00860,A,there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows choose a place where you won t do harm yes choose a place where you won t do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine
p00861_A,00861,A,oh mr emerson i see you re clever
p00862_A,00862,A,eh

p00894_A,00894,A,you and are you tired
p00895_A,00895,A,of course i m not
p00896_A,00896,A,do you mind being beaten
p00897_A,00897,A,yes i don t see you re such a splendid player though the light was behind you and it was in my eyes
p00898_A,00898,A,i never said i was
p00899_A,00899,A,why you did
p00900_A,00900,A,you didn t attend
p00901_A,00901,A,you said oh don t go in for accuracy at this house we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who don t leonora is leonora the heroine who s the book by
p00902_A,00902,A,joseph emery prank
p00903_A,00903,A,indeed why it s miss lavish it s miss lavish s novel and she s publishing it under somebody else s name
p00904_A,00904,A,who may miss lavish be
p00905_A,00905,A,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p00906_A,00906,A,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p00907_A,00907,A,weren t you pleased no wonder the novel s bad i never liked miss lavish but i suppose one ought to read it as one s met her
p00908_A,00908,A,all modern books are bad every one writes for money in these days
p00909_A,00909,A,oh cecil
p00910_A,00910,A,it is so i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p00911_A,00911,A,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p00912_A,00912,A,i never notice much difference in views
p00913_A,00913,A,what do you mean
p00914_A,00914,A,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p00915_A,00915,A,h m
p00916_A,00916,A,my father says that there is only one perfect view the view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it
p00917_A,00917,A,i expect your father has been reading dante
p00918_A,00918,A,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills
p00919_A,00919,A,what a splendid idea i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again i m so sorry he s not so well
p00920_A,00920,A,no he isn t well
p00921_A,00921,A,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p00922_A,00922,A,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p00923_A,00923,A,none why
p00924_A,00924,A,you spoke of
p00925_A,00925,A,my mother i was meaning
p00926_A,00926,A,oh cecil how you made me jump
p00927_A,00927,A,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p00928_A,00928,A,i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead it is the first thing that i remember cecil do read the thing about the view
p00929_A,00929,A,not while mr emerson is here to entertain us
p00930_A,00930,A,no read away i think nothing s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go
p00931_A,00931,A,mr emerson go and find tennis balls
p00932_A,00932,A,am i really to go
p00933_A,00933,A,no of course not really
p00934_A,00934,A,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book
p00935_A,00935,A,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p00936_A,00936,A,this isn t the passage i wanted there is another much funnier further on
p00937_A,00937,A,something too awful has happened do you know anything about miss lavish s novel there is a scene in it the hero and heroine make love do you know about that
p00938_A,00938,A,dear
p00939_A,00939,A,do you know about it please they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance
p00940_A,00940,A,my good lucia i am all at sea i know nothing about it whatever
p00941_A,00941,A,there are violets i cannot believe it is a coincidence charlotte charlotte how could you have told her i have thought before speaking it must be you
p00942_A,00942,A,told her what
p00943_A,00943,A,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p00944_A,00944,A,oh lucy dearest girl she hasn t put that in her book
p00945_A,00945,A,not so that one could recognize it yes
p00946_A,00946,A,then never never never more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00947_A,00947,A,so you did tell
p00948_A,00948,A,i did just happen when i had tea with her at rome in the course of conversation
p00949_A,00949,A,but charlotte what about the promise you gave me when we were packing why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldn t even let me tell mother
p00950_A,00950,A,i will never forgive eleanor she has betrayed my confidence
p00951_A,00951,A,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p00952_A,00952,A,oh lucy i shall never forgive myself never to my dying day fancy if your prospects
p00953_A,00953,A,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p00954_A,00954,A,i always said he was a cad dear give me credit for that at all events from the very first moment when he said his father was having a bath
p00955_A,00955,A,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p00956_A,00956,A,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p00957_A,00957,A,i want something more definite will you speak to him it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word
p00958_A,00958,A,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00959_A,00959,A,yes or no please yes or no
p00960_A,00960,A,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle
p00961_A,00961,A,oh lucy but that is brave of you i admire you
p00962_A,00962,A,freddy has taken him into the dining room the others are going down the garden come let us get this over quickly come i want you in the room of course
p00963_A,00963,A,lucy do you mind doing it
p00964_A,00964,A,how can you ask such a ridiculous question
p00965_A,00965,A,try the jam the jam s jolly good
p00966_A,00966,A,no nothing to eat
p00967_A,00967,A,you go down to the others charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants where s mother
p00968_A,00968,A,she s started on her sunday writing she s in the drawing room
p00969_A,00969,A,i can t have it mr emerson i cannot even talk to you go out of this house and never come into it again as long as i live here i hate a row go please
p00970_A,00970,A,what
p00971_A,00971,A,no discussion
p00972_A,00972,A,but i can t
p00973_A,00973,A,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p00974_A,00974,A,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p00975_A,00975,A,you are merely ridiculous
p00976_A,00976,A,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p00977_A,00977,A,i can scarcely discuss
p00978_A,00978,A,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p00979_A,00979,A,you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit
p00980_A,00980,A,lucy be quick there s no time for us to talk now come to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain i have cared for you since that man died i cannot live without you i thought but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered i called i wanted to live and have my chance of joy
p00981_A,00981,A,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p00982_A,00982,A,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p00983_A,00983,A,oh lucia come back here oh what an awful man
p00984_A,00984,A,well he amuses me either i m mad or else he is and i m inclined to think it s the latter one more fuss through with you charlotte many thanks i think though that this is the last my admirer will hardly trouble me again
p00985_A,00985,A,well it isn t everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it oh one oughtn t to laugh really it might have been very serious but you were so sensible and brave so unlike the girls of my day
p00986_A,00986,A,hullo lucy there s still light enough for another set if you two ll hurry
p00987_A,00987,A,mr emerson has had to go
p00988_A,00988,A,what a nuisance that spoils the four i say cecil do play do there s a good chap it s floyd s last day do play tennis with us just this once
p00989_A,00989,A,my dear freddy i am no athlete as you well remarked this very morning i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you
p00990_A,00990,A,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p00991_A,00991,A,different how how
p00992_A,00992,A,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should
p00993_A,00993,A,i don t understand you you aren t like yourself you re tired lucy
p00994_A,00994,A,tired that is exactly like you you always think women don t mean what they say
p00995_A,00995,A,well you sound tired as if something has worried you
p00996_A,00996,A,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p00997_A,00997,A,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p00998_A,00998,A,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p00999_A,00999,A,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p01000_A,01000,A,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p01001_A,01001,A,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p01002_A,01002,A,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p01003_A,01003,A,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p01004_A,01004,A,what s the good of a scene
p01005_A,01005,A,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p01006_A,01006,A,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p01007_A,01007,A,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p01008_A,01008,A,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p01009_A,01009,A,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p01010_A,01010,A,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p01011_A,01011,A,it is true
p01012_A,01012,A,true on the whole
p01013_A,01013,A,true every word it is a revelation it is i
p01014_A,01014,A,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p01015_A,01015,A,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p01016_A,01016,A,what do you mean by a new voice
p01017_A,01017,A,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p01018_A,01018,A,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p01019_A,01019,A,of course i don t think that you are not that kind lucy
p01020_A,01020,A,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p01021_A,01021,A,i may have said that in the past i shall never say it again you have taught me better of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadn t known of up till now
p01022_A,01022,A,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p01023_A,01023,A,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p01024_A,01024,A,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness
p01025_A,01025,A,let me light your candle shall i thank you good night again god bless you lucy
p01026_A,01026,A,so you re off for a minute mr vyse
p01027_A,01027,A,yes
p01028_A,01028,A,i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch isn t it wonderful isn t it romance most certainly they will go to constantinople they are taken in a snare that cannot fail they will end by going round the world isn t romance capricious i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn no ordinary view will content the miss alans they want the pension keats
p01029_A,01029,A,i m awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe but have you any matches
p01030_A,01030,A,i have
p01031_A,01031,A,you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse
p01032_A,01032,A,never
p01033_A,01033,A,then you don t see the wonder of this greek visit i haven t been to greece myself and don t mean to go and i can t imagine any of my friends going it is altogether too big for our little lot don t you think so italy is just about as much as we can manage italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilish i am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus all right freddy i am not being clever upon my word i am not i took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when you ve done with them i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian big enough in all conscience the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me there the contrast is just as much as i can realize but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria
p01034_A,01034,A,you re quite right greece is not for our little lot
p01035_A,01035,A,i m so glad you only talked about books cecil s hard hit lucy won t marry him if you d gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down
p01036_A,01036,A,but when
p01037_A,01037,A,late last night i must go
p01038_A,01038,A,perhaps they won t want me down there
p01039_A,01039,A,no go on good bye
p01040_A,01040,A,oh how do you do mr beebe gracious what a mess everything is look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when i had counted on having powell who give every one their due does tie up dahlias properly
p01041_A,01041,A,how do you do
p01042_A,01042,A,here lennie the bass
p01043_A,01043,A,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may
p01044_A,01044,A,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p01045_A,01045,A,it is terrible this havoc among the flowers
p01046_A,01046,A,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p01047_A,01047,A,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p01048_A,01048,A,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p01049_A,01049,A,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p01050_A,01050,A,how do you do miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive would you come too
p01051_A,01051,A,i don t think i will thank you
p01052_A,01052,A,no i didn t suppose you would care to much how delicate those sonatas are miss honeychurch
p01053_A,01053,A,yes
p01054_A,01054,A,i met them on the hill your brother told me
p01055_A,01055,A,oh he did
p01056_A,01056,A,i needn t say that it will go no further
p01057_A,01057,A,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p01058_A,01058,A,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p01059_A,01059,A,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p01060_A,01060,A,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p01061_A,01061,A,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p01062_A,01062,A,i am very sorry for that
p01063_A,01063,A,and freddy minds
p01064_A,01064,A,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p01065_A,01065,A,boys are so odd
p01066_A,01066,A,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p01067_A,01067,A,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p01068_A,01068,A,next week i gather
p01069_A,01069,A,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p01070_A,01070,A,no he didn t
p01071_A,01071,A,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p01072_A,01072,A,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p01073_A,01073,A,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p01074_A,01074,A,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p01075_A,01075,A,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p01076_A,01076,A,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p01077_A,01077,A,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p01078_A,01078,A,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p01079_A,01079,A,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p01080_A,01080,A,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p01081_A,01081,A,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p01082_A,01082,A,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p01083_A,01083,A,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p01084_A,01084,A,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p01085_A,01085,A,i must get away ever so far i must know my own mind and where i want to go
p01086_A,01086,A,she is playing again
p01087_A,01087,A,lucy can always play
p01088_A,01088,A,we had much better let the matter drop
p01089_A,01089,A,i wonder
p01090_A,01090,A,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p01091_A,01091,A,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p01092_A,01092,A,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p01093_A,01093,A,quite so
p01094_A,01094,A,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p01095_A,01095,A,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p01096_A,01096,A,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p01097_A,01097,A,really now why
p01098_A,01098,A,she wanted to leave windy corner
p01099_A,01099,A,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p01100_A,01100,A,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p01101_A,01101,A,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p01102_A,01102,A,but my feelings are of no importance i know too well that i get on lucy s nerves our tour was a failure she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mother s money
p01103_A,01103,A,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p01104_A,01104,A,very well i for one will help her to go to greece will you it is absolutely necessary i know i know she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes i trust that the servants know nothing afterwards but i may have said too much already only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone if you help we may succeed otherwise
p01105_A,01105,A,otherwise
p01106_A,01106,A,otherwise
p01107_A,01107,A,it gets too dark this comes of putting off we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece i don t know what the world s coming to
p01108_A,01108,A,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p01109_A,01109,A,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful
p01110_A,01110,A,so am i
p01111_A,01111,A,good now come up to the house
p01112_A,01112,A,i don t see why greece is necessary but as you do i suppose it is all right it must be something i can t understand lucy let s tell her lucy
p01113_A,01113,A,she is playing the piano i didn t know that miss honeychurch sang too
p01114_A,01114,A,all right dear i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias
p01115_A,01115,A,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p01116_A,01116,A,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p01117_A,01117,A,oh splendid oh thank you
p01118_A,01118,A,here s mr beebe
p01119_A,01119,A,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p01120_A,01120,A,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p01121_A,01121,A,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p01122_A,01122,A,i suspected it was unscholarly it s so beautiful
p01123_A,01123,A,the tune s right enough but the words are rotten why throw up the sponge
p01124_A,01124,A,how stupidly you talk
p01125_A,01125,A,this has been a day and a half
p01126_A,01126,A,wait a minute she is finishing
p01127_A,01127,A,but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you a gentleman is such a stand by we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you it is not every young man who would be so unselfish but perhaps he will come out and join you later on
p01128_A,01128,A,or does his work keep him in london
p01129_A,01129,A,however we shall see him when he sees you off i do so long to see him
p01130_A,01130,A,no one will see lucy off she doesn t like it
p01131_A,01131,A,no i hate seeings off
p01132_A,01132,A,really how funny i should have thought that in this case
p01133_A,01133,A,oh mrs honeychurch you aren t going it is such a pleasure to have met you
p01134_A,01134,A,that s all right we just got through that time
p01135_A,01135,A,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p01136_A,01136,A,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p01137_A,01137,A,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p01138_A,01138,A,it s only for a few days
p01139_A,01139,A,but why at all
p01140_A,01140,A,you re tired of windy corner
p01141_A,01141,A,oh mother what rubbish you talk of course i m not tired of windy corner
p01142_A,01142,A,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p01143_A,01143,A,half a minute would be nearer
p01144_A,01144,A,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p01145_A,01145,A,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p01146_A,01146,A,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p01147_A,01147,A,i want more independence
p01148_A,01148,A,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p01149_A,01149,A,perhaps i spoke hastily
p01150_A,01150,A,oh goodness how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett
p01151_A,01151,A,charlotte
p01152_A,01152,A,more every moment
p01153_A,01153,A,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p01154_A,01154,A,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p01155_A,01155,A,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p01156_A,01156,A,there you go
p01157_A,01157,A,i beg your pardon
p01158_A,01158,A,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p01159_A,01159,A,can t we have the hood down
p01160_A,01160,A,very well old lady stop the horse
p01161_A,01161,A,is that house to let again powell
p01162_A,01162,A,yes miss
p01163_A,01163,A,have they gone
p01164_A,01164,A,it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his father s rheumatism has come on so he can t stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished
p01165_A,01165,A,they have gone then
p01166_A,01166,A,yes miss they have gone
p01167_A,01167,A,certainly i forgot it was friday let s all go powell can go round to the stables
p01168_A,01168,A,lucy dearest
p01169_A,01169,A,a lady to wait sir
p01170_A,01170,A,oh miss honeychurch that you should come miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry george is so sorry he thought he had a right to try i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first he ought not to have tried i knew nothing about it at all but you must not scold him i taught him to trust in love i said i said true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result poor boy he is so sorry he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean yet miss honeychurch do you remember italy
p01171_A,01171,A,i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son
p01172_A,01172,A,but you do remember it
p01173_A,01173,A,he has misbehaved himself from the first
p01174_A,01174,A,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p01175_A,01175,A,why he has behaved abominably i am glad he is sorry do you know what he did
p01176_A,01176,A,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p01177_A,01177,A,no of course is much too strong i am sorry i used it about your son i think i will go to church after all my mother and my cousin have gone i shall not be so very late
p01178_A,01178,A,especially as he has gone under
p01179_A,01179,A,what was that
p01180_A,01180,A,gone under naturally
p01181_A,01181,A,i don t understand
p01182_A,01182,A,as his mother did
p01183_A,01183,A,but mr emerson mr emerson what are you talking about
p01184_A,01184,A,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p01185_A,01185,A,i don t know i don t understand this sort of thing i was not meant to understand it
p01186_A,01186,A,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p01187_A,01187,A,oh how terrible
p01188_A,01188,A,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p01189_A,01189,A,i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair i am deeply sorry about it
p01190_A,01190,A,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p01191_A,01191,A,mr emerson don t leave at least not on my account i am going to greece don t leave your comfortable house
p01192_A,01192,A,how good everyone is and look at mr beebe housing me came over this morning and heard i was going here i am so comfortable with a fire
p01193_A,01193,A,yes but you won t go back to london it s absurd
p01194_A,01194,A,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p01195_A,01195,A,oh mr emerson you mustn t i ve been bother enough to the world by now i can t have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through it all on my account you must stop i am just going to greece
p01196_A,01196,A,all the way to greece to greece
p01197_A,01197,A,so you must stop you won t talk about this business i know i can trust you both
p01198_A,01198,A,certainly you can we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen
p01199_A,01199,A,i shouldn t want
p01200_A,01200,A,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow
p01201_A,01201,A,no please sit still i think i will sit in the carriage
p01202_A,01202,A,miss honeychurch you do sound tired
p01203_A,01203,A,not a bit
p01204_A,01204,A,but you are and there s a look of george about you and what were you saying about going abroad greece greece but you were to be married this year i thought
p01205_A,01205,A,not till january it wasn t
p01206_A,01206,A,i suppose that mr vyse is going with you i hope it isn t because george spoke that you are both going
p01207_A,01207,A,no
p01208_A,01208,A,i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse
p01209_A,01209,A,that s all right i counted on you two keeping each other company it s pouring again the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it did powell go round
p01210_A,01210,A,i think so i ll see
p01211_A,01211,A,no of course i ll see how are the miss alans
p01212_A,01212,A,very well thank you
p01213_A,01213,A,did you tell mr emerson about greece

p01218_A,01218,A,i i had to
p01219_A,01219,A,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p01220_A,01220,A,how dare you oh how like a man i mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man
p01221_A,01221,A,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy

p01240_A,01240,A,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p01241_A,01241,A,no it isn t because it is the room i had and i had your father s room i forget why charlotte made me for some reason george you baby get up
p01242_A,01242,A,why shouldn t i be a baby
p01243_A,01243,A,oh bother charlotte what can such people be made of
p01244_A,01244,A,same stuff as parsons are made of
p01245_A,01245,A,nonsense
p01246_A,01246,A,quite right it is nonsense
p01247_A,01247,A,now you get up off the cold floor or you ll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly

p01255_A,01255,A,signorino domani faremo uno giro
p01256_A,01256,A,but it will all come right in the end he has to build us both up from the beginning again i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women he has for the second time quite altered why will men have theories about women i haven t any about men i wish too that mr beebe
p01257_A,01257,A,you may well wish that
p01258_A,01258,A,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p01259_A,01259,A,signorino domani faremo
p01260_A,01260,A,oh bother that man
p01261_A,01261,A,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p01262_A,01262,A,look at the lights going over the bridge
p01263_A,01263,A,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p01264_A,01264,A,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p01265_A,01265,A,oh no she didn t see him she was upstairs with old mrs beebe don t you remember and then went straight to the church she said so
p01266_A,01266,A,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p01267_A,01267,A,how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment
p01268_A,01268,A,or did she mean it
p01269_A,01269,A,signorino domani faremo uno giro
p01270_A,01270,A,lascia prego lascia siamo sposati
p01271_A,01271,A,scusi tanto signora buona sera e grazie
p01272_A,01272,A,mean what george
p01273_A,01273,A,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p00000_B,00000,B,and a cockney besides it might be london charlotte don t you feel too that we might be in london i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside i suppose it is one s being so tired
p00001_B,00001,B,this meat has surely been used for soup
p00002_B,00002,B,i want so to see the arno the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno the signora had no business to do it at all oh it is a shame
p00003_B,00003,B,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p00004_B,00004,B,charlotte you mustn t spoil me of course you must look over the arno too i meant that the first vacant room in the front
p00005_B,00005,B,you must have it
p00006_B,00006,B,no no you must have it
p00007_B,00007,B,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p00008_B,00008,B,she would never forgive me
p00009_B,00009,B,a view oh a view how delightful a view is
p00010_B,00010,B,this is my son his name s george he has a view too
p00011_B,00011,B,ah
p00012_B,00012,B,what i mean is that you can have our rooms and we ll have yours we ll change
p00013_B,00013,B,thank you very much indeed that is out of the question
p00014_B,00014,B,why
p00015_B,00015,B,because it is quite out of the question thank you
p00016_B,00016,B,you see we don t like to take
p00017_B,00017,B,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p00018_B,00018,B,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p00019_B,00019,B,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p00020_B,00020,B,oh oh why it s mr beebe oh how perfectly lovely oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are oh
p00021_B,00021,B,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p00022_B,00022,B,i am so glad to see you just fancy how small the world is summer street too makes it so specially funny
p00023_B,00023,B,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p00024_B,00024,B,yes i heard from mother so last week she didn t know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr beebe is
p00025_B,00025,B,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p00026_B,00026,B,oh how glad i am the name of our house is windy corner there is mother and me generally and my brother though it s not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean
p00027_B,00027,B,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p00028_B,00028,B,i am eating it thank you and enjoying it
p00029_B,00029,B,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p00030_B,00030,B,that lady looks so clever we are in luck
p00031_B,00031,B,we are most grateful to you the first evening means so much when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d heure do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner
p00032_B,00032,B,emerson
p00033_B,00033,B,is he a friend of yours
p00034_B,00034,B,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p00035_B,00035,B,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p00036_B,00036,B,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p00037_B,00037,B,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p00038_B,00038,B,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p00039_B,00039,B,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p00040_B,00040,B,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p00041_B,00041,B,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p00042_B,00042,B,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p00043_B,00043,B,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p00044_B,00044,B,not at all i never suggested that
p00045_B,00045,B,but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness
p00046_B,00046,B,he is nice just what i remember he seems to see good in everyone no one would take him for a clergyman
p00047_B,00047,B,my dear lucia
p00048_B,00048,B,well you know what i mean and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man
p00049_B,00049,B,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p00050_B,00050,B,i m sure she will and so will freddy
p00051_B,00051,B,i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times
p00052_B,00052,B,yes
p00053_B,00053,B,i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion
p00054_B,00054,B,i must have been selfish or unkind i must be more careful it is so dreadful for charlotte being poor
p00055_B,00055,B,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p00056_B,00056,B,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p00057_B,00057,B,i think he was meaning to be kind
p00058_B,00058,B,undoubtedly he was
p00059_B,00059,B,mr beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature of course i was holding back on my cousin s account about old mr emerson i hardly know no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same time beautiful
p00060_B,00060,B,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p00061_B,00061,B,so one would have thought but things are so difficult i sometimes think
p00062_B,00062,B,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p00063_B,00063,B,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p00064_B,00064,B,my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally
p00065_B,00065,B,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p00066_B,00066,B,poor young man
p00067_B,00067,B,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p00068_B,00068,B,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p00069_B,00069,B,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p00070_B,00070,B,how you do do everything
p00071_B,00071,B,naturally dear it is my affair
p00072_B,00072,B,but i would like to help you
p00073_B,00073,B,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p00074_B,00074,B,mother wouldn t mind i m sure
p00075_B,00075,B,what does it mean
p00076_B,00076,B,is it a very nice smell
p00077_B,00077,B,one doesn t come to italy for niceness one comes for life buon giorno buon giorno look at that adorable wine cart how the driver stares at us dear simple soul buon giorno take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors that is the true democracy though i am a real radical as well there now you re shocked
p00078_B,00078,B,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland
p00079_B,00079,B,i see i see and now you have gone over to the enemy
p00080_B,00080,B,oh please if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp
p00081_B,00081,B,shameful a manufacturing district i suppose
p00082_B,00082,B,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p00083_B,00083,B,what a delightful part i know it so well it is full of the very nicest people do you know sir harry otway a radical if ever there was
p00084_B,00084,B,very well indeed
p00085_B,00085,B,and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist
p00086_B,00086,B,why she rents a field of us how funny
p00087_B,00087,B,oh you have property in surrey
p00088_B,00088,B,hardly any only thirty acres just the garden all downhill and some fields
p00089_B,00089,B,bless us bless us and save us we ve lost the way lost lost my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us what are we to do two lone females in an unknown town now this is what i call an adventure oh but that is the word of a craven and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker give it to me i shan t let you carry it we will simply drift stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them i do detest conventional intercourse nasty they are going into the church too oh the britisher abroad
p00090_B,00090,B,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p00091_B,00091,B,look at their figures they walk through my italy like a pair of cows it s very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldn t pass it
p00092_B,00092,B,what would you ask us
p00093_B,00093,B,there goes my local colour box i must have a word with him
p00094_B,00094,B,niente
p00095_B,00095,B,i m not sure she understands english
p00096_B,00096,B,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p00097_B,00097,B,no i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the door it is too bad she simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself
p00098_B,00098,B,why shouldn t you
p00099_B,00099,B,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p00100_B,00100,B,but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker
p00101_B,00101,B,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p00102_B,00102,B,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p00103_B,00103,B,thank you very much but i could not think of that i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience
p00104_B,00104,B,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p00105_B,00105,B,i am not touchy i hope it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are
p00106_B,00106,B,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p00107_B,00107,B,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p00108_B,00108,B,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p00109_B,00109,B,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p00110_B,00110,B,some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up it did happen like that if it happened at all
p00111_B,00111,B,stop there s plenty of room for us all stop
p00112_B,00112,B,perhaps he is i don t remember
p00113_B,00113,B,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p00114_B,00114,B,he will not come back
p00115_B,00115,B,i hope we all try
p00116_B,00116,B,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p00117_B,00117,B,how silly of them i think that a kind action done tactfully
p00118_B,00118,B,tact
p00119_B,00119,B,but we have spoilt the pleasure of i don t know how many people they won t come back
p00120_B,00120,B,yes they are lovely do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin
p00121_B,00121,B,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p00122_B,00122,B,i like giotto it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values though i like things like the della robbia babies better
p00123_B,00123,B,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p00124_B,00124,B,oh dear
p00125_B,00125,B,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p00126_B,00126,B,and what is it
p00127_B,00127,B,the old trouble things won t fit
p00128_B,00128,B,what things
p00129_B,00129,B,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p00130_B,00130,B,oh mr emerson whatever do you mean
p00131_B,00131,B,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p00132_B,00132,B,i m very sorry you ll think me unfeeling but but
p00133_B,00133,B,oh good gracious me where where

p00137_B,00137,B,poor girl i fail to understand the point of that remark i think myself a very fortunate girl i assure you i m thoroughly happy and having a splendid time pray don t waste time mourning over me there s enough sorrow in the world isn t there without trying to invent it good bye thank you both so much for all your kindness ah yes there does come my cousin a delightful morning santa croce is a wonderful church
p00138_B,00138,B,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p00139_B,00139,B,introduce me
p00140_B,00140,B,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p00141_B,00141,B,my sermon why ever did she listen to it
p00142_B,00142,B,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p00143_B,00143,B,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p00144_B,00144,B,of course
p00145_B,00145,B,music
p00146_B,00146,B,what about music
p00147_B,00147,B,poor charlotte will be sopped
p00148_B,00148,B,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p00149_B,00149,B,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p00150_B,00150,B,they do say so
p00151_B,00151,B,what is it about
p00152_B,00152,B,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p00153_B,00153,B,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p00154_B,00154,B,the two ladies at all events have made it up
p00155_B,00155,B,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p00156_B,00156,B,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p00157_B,00157,B,what was that
p00158_B,00158,B,it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely
p00159_B,00159,B,whatever happened
p00160_B,00160,B,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p00161_B,00161,B,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p00162_B,00162,B,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p00163_B,00163,B,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p00164_B,00164,B,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p00165_B,00165,B,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p00166_B,00166,B,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p00167_B,00167,B,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p00168_B,00168,B,italians dear you know
p00169_B,00169,B,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p00170_B,00170,B,she oughtn t really to go at all and she knows it i put it down to too much beethoven
p00171_B,00171,B,you fainted
p00172_B,00172,B,i i am very sorry
p00173_B,00173,B,how are you now

p00178_B,00178,B,i bought some photographs at alinari s i must have dropped them out there in the square would you add to your kindness by fetching them
p00179_B,00179,B,miss honeychurch you sit still you aren t fit to go home alone
p00180_B,00180,B,yes i am thank you so very much
p00181_B,00181,B,no you aren t you d go openly if you were
p00182_B,00182,B,but i had rather
p00183_B,00183,B,then i don t fetch your photographs
p00184_B,00184,B,i had rather be alone
p00185_B,00185,B,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p00186_B,00186,B,oh what have i done
p00187_B,00187,B,things i didn t want
p00188_B,00188,B,mr emerson
p00189_B,00189,B,well
p00190_B,00190,B,where are the photographs i believe it was my photographs that you threw away
p00191_B,00191,B,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p00192_B,00192,B,mr emerson
p00193_B,00193,B,i want to ask you something before we go in
p00194_B,00194,B,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p00195_B,00195,B,i nearly fainted myself
p00196_B,00196,B,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p00197_B,00197,B,oh all right
p00198_B,00198,B,and this is the real point you know how silly people are gossiping ladies especially i am afraid you understand what i mean
p00199_B,00199,B,i m afraid i don t
p00200_B,00200,B,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p00201_B,00201,B,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p00202_B,00202,B,thank you so much and would you well thank you so much how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life
p00203_B,00203,B,i don t i shall probably want to live
p00204_B,00204,B,but why mr emerson what do you mean
p00205_B,00205,B,i shall want to live i say
p00206_B,00206,B,very well dear how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too look lucia oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party i feared you would repent you of your choice
p00207_B,00207,B,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p00208_B,00208,B,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p00209_B,00209,B,it is i who am sorry literary hacks are shameless creatures i believe there s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn t pry
p00210_B,00210,B,what is the heroine s name
p00211_B,00211,B,leonora
p00212_B,00212,B,i do hope she s nice and what is the plot
p00213_B,00213,B,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p00214_B,00214,B,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p00215_B,00215,B,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p00216_B,00216,B,she is my idea of a really clever woman that last remark struck me as so particularly true it should be a most pathetic novel
p00217_B,00217,B,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p00218_B,00218,B,we were chatting to miss lavish
p00219_B,00219,B,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p00220_B,00220,B,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p00221_B,00221,B,and how came we to have you here
p00222_B,00222,B,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned
p00223_B,00223,B,so you were here alone miss honeychurch
p00224_B,00224,B,practically
p00225_B,00225,B,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p00226_B,00226,B,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p00227_B,00227,B,he died by the fountain i believe
p00228_B,00228,B,and you and your friend
p00229_B,00229,B,were over at the loggia
p00230_B,00230,B,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p00231_B,00231,B,willingly would i purchase
p00232_B,00232,B,ignore him
p00233_B,00233,B,how wonderfully people rise in these days
p00234_B,00234,B,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p00235_B,00235,B,is he a journalist now
p00236_B,00236,B,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p00237_B,00237,B,oh so he has a wife
p00238_B,00238,B,dead miss bartlett dead i wonder yes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me he was in my london parish long ago the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him let him beware that he does not get more than a snub
p00239_B,00239,B,what
p00240_B,00240,B,exposure
p00241_B,00241,B,do you mean that he is an irreligious man we know that already
p00242_B,00242,B,lucy dear
p00243_B,00243,B,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p00244_B,00244,B,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p00245_B,00245,B,to speak plainly it is i will say no more
p00246_B,00246,B,you have said very little
p00247_B,00247,B,it was my intention to say very little murder if you want to know that man murdered his wife
p00248_B,00248,B,how
p00249_B,00249,B,to all intents and purposes he murdered her that day in santa croce did they say anything against me
p00250_B,00250,B,not a word mr eager not a single word
p00251_B,00251,B,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p00252_B,00252,B,i m not defending them they re nothing to me
p00253_B,00253,B,how could you think she was defending them
p00254_B,00254,B,drive oh is our drive to come off
p00255_B,00255,B,if that is so dear if the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish
p00256_B,00256,B,how
p00257_B,00257,B,because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too
p00258_B,00258,B,that will mean another carriage
p00259_B,00259,B,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p00260_B,00260,B,it is indeed
p00261_B,00261,B,what do you think about it
p00262_B,00262,B,i don t know what i think nor what i want
p00263_B,00263,B,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p00264_B,00264,B,thank you charlotte
p00265_B,00265,B,and the news
p00266_B,00266,B,mrs vyse and her son have gone to rome do you know the vyses
p00267_B,00267,B,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p00268_B,00268,B,they re nice people the vyses so clever my idea of what s really clever don t you long to be in rome
p00269_B,00269,B,i die for it
p00270_B,00270,B,charlotte here s an idea what if we popped off to rome to morrow straight to the vyses hotel for i do know what i want i m sick of florence no you said you d go to the ends of the earth do do
p00271_B,00271,B,oh you droll person pray what would become of your drive in the hills
p00272_B,00272,B,oh dear me no oh no
p00273_B,00273,B,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p00274_B,00274,B,oh no i am here as a tourist
p00275_B,00275,B,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p00276_B,00276,B,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p00277_B,00277,B,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p00278_B,00278,B,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day
p00279_B,00279,B,doubtless you know her monographs in the series of mediaeval byways he is working at gemistus pletho sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i think think i think how little they think what lies so near them
p00280_B,00280,B,va bene signore va bene va bene she is my sister
p00281_B,00281,B,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure
p00282_B,00282,B,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p00283_B,00283,B,surely no
p00284_B,00284,B,signorina
p00285_B,00285,B,victory at last
p00286_B,00286,B,it is not victory it is defeat you have parted two people who were happy we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it we have no rights over his soul
p00287_B,00287,B,he was not driving us well he jolted us
p00288_B,00288,B,that i deny it was as restful as sleeping aha he is jolting us now can you wonder he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified and if i were superstitious i d be frightened of the girl too it doesn t do to injure young people have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici
p00289_B,00289,B,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature
p00290_B,00290,B,the lord knows possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet he wrote a line so i heard yesterday which runs like this don t go fighting against the spring
p00291_B,00291,B,would render a correct meaning
p00292_B,00292,B,the point is we have warred with it look fifty miles of spring and we ve come up to admire them do you suppose there s any difference between spring in nature and spring in man but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both
p00293_B,00293,B,eleanor be quiet hush they ll hear the emersons
p00294_B,00294,B,eleanor
p00295_B,00295,B,miss honeychurch listening pouf wouf you naughty girl go away

p00299_B,00299,B,please i d rather stop here with you
p00300_B,00300,B,no i agree it s like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls miss lucy you are to go we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear
p00301_B,00301,B,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p00302_B,00302,B,then sit you down observe my foresight
p00303_B,00303,B,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p00304_B,00304,B,dove dove buoni uomini
p00305_B,00305,B,ma buoni uomini what is that
p00306_B,00306,B,eccolo courage courage and love
p00307_B,00307,B,all the way he will be hours
p00308_B,00308,B,apparently i told him it was unwise
p00309_B,00309,B,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p00310_B,00310,B,no of course
p00311_B,00311,B,even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking courage courage and faith
p00312_B,00312,B,george ask your driver which way george went the boy may lose his way he may be killed

p00324_B,00324,B,heroes gods the nonsense of schoolgirls
p00325_B,00325,B,and then

p00334_B,00334,B,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p00335_B,00335,B,i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do
p00336_B,00336,B,i too intend to judge him charitably but unfortunately i have met the type before they seldom keep their exploits to themselves
p00337_B,00337,B,exploits
p00338_B,00338,B,my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first come here and listen to me i am only gathering it from his own remarks do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another well i am no prude there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish but we are no farther on with our question what do you propose to do
p00339_B,00339,B,i propose to speak to him you see charlotte your kindness i shall never forget it but as you said it is my affair mine and his
p00340_B,00340,B,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p00341_B,00341,B,certainly not there would be no difficulty whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over i have been frightened of him but now i am not one little bit
p00342_B,00342,B,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p00343_B,00343,B,i can t think
p00344_B,00344,B,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p00345_B,00345,B,i can t think
p00346_B,00346,B,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p00347_B,00347,B,i hadn t time to think you came
p00348_B,00348,B,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done

p00351_B,00351,B,what train
p00352_B,00352,B,the train to rome
p00353_B,00353,B,when does the train to rome go

p00356_B,00356,B,we must face that
p00357_B,00357,B,she will make us pay for a whole week s pension
p00358_B,00358,B,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p00359_B,00359,B,yes but they pay extra for wine
p00360_B,00360,B,dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me
p00361_B,00361,B,charlotte dear what do you mean as if i have anything to forgive
p00362_B,00362,B,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p00363_B,00363,B,but no
p00364_B,00364,B,ah but yes i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped i might have known it would not do you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you i am too uninteresting and old fashioned only fit to pack and unpack your things
p00365_B,00365,B,please
p00366_B,00366,B,my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary you had your own way about these rooms at all events
p00367_B,00367,B,you mustn t say these things
p00368_B,00368,B,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p00369_B,00369,B,but mother will understand it is not your fault this trouble and it isn t a disaster either
p00370_B,00370,B,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p00371_B,00371,B,every right
p00372_B,00372,B,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p00373_B,00373,B,why need mother hear of it
p00374_B,00374,B,but you tell her everything
p00375_B,00375,B,i suppose i do generally
p00376_B,00376,B,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p00377_B,00377,B,naturally i should have told her but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to i will never speak of it either to her or to any one
p00378_B,00378,B,i wish one word with you in the drawing room mr emerson please good night mr emerson
p00379_B,00379,B,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p00380_B,00380,B,time they did
p00381_B,00381,B,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p00382_B,00382,B,it s his third go isn t it
p00383_B,00383,B,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00384_B,00384,B,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p00385_B,00385,B,do you indeed dear how interesting
p00386_B,00386,B,i feel never mind
p00387_B,00387,B,just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse i said dear mrs vyse
p00388_B,00388,B,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p00389_B,00389,B,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me
p00390_B,00390,B,nor me
p00391_B,00391,B,you what do you mean
p00392_B,00392,B,he asked me for my permission also
p00393_B,00393,B,how very odd of him
p00394_B,00394,B,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p00395_B,00395,B,what do you know about lucy or girls or anything what ever did you say
p00396_B,00396,B,i said to cecil
p00397_B,00397,B,what a helpful answer
p00398_B,00398,B,the bother is this
p00399_B,00399,B,freddy you must come there they still are
p00400_B,00400,B,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p00401_B,00401,B,peeping like that can t i look out of my own window still page 322
p00402_B,00402,B,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p00403_B,00403,B,i hope you gave a careful answer dear
p00404_B,00404,B,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p00405_B,00405,B,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p00406_B,00406,B,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p00407_B,00407,B,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p00408_B,00408,B,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p00409_B,00409,B,well i like him i know his mother he s good he s clever he s rich he s well connected oh you needn t kick the piano he s well connected i ll say it again if you like he s well connected and he has beautiful manners
p00410_B,00410,B,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p00411_B,00411,B,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p00412_B,00412,B,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p00413_B,00413,B,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p00414_B,00414,B,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p00415_B,00415,B,don t interrupt so foolishly where was i oh yes no i ll cross that last bit out it looks patronizing i ll stop at or shall i cross that out too
p00416_B,00416,B,cross it out too
p00417_B,00417,B,then the whole thing runs
p00418_B,00418,B,look out
p00419_B,00419,B,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me
p00420_B,00420,B,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p00421_B,00421,B,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy
p00422_B,00422,B,i hope so
p00423_B,00423,B,we mothers
p00424_B,00424,B,i say lucy
p00425_B,00425,B,steady on
p00426_B,00426,B,not a kiss for me
p00427_B,00427,B,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p00428_B,00428,B,we go with lucy
p00429_B,00429,B,yes you go with lucy
p00430_B,00430,B,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p00431_B,00431,B,i should say so food is the thing one does get here don t sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it
p00432_B,00432,B,pfui
p00433_B,00433,B,i know i know i can t think why mrs honeychurch allows it
p00434_B,00434,B,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p00435_B,00435,B,news i don t understand you news
p00436_B,00436,B,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p00437_B,00437,B,has he indeed
p00438_B,00438,B,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p00439_B,00439,B,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p00440_B,00440,B,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p00441_B,00441,B,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p00442_B,00442,B,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p00443_B,00443,B,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p00444_B,00444,B,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p00445_B,00445,B,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p00446_B,00446,B,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p00447_B,00447,B,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p00448_B,00448,B,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p00449_B,00449,B,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p00450_B,00450,B,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p00451_B,00451,B,she has none
p00452_B,00452,B,i quite agree at present she has none
p00453_B,00453,B,at present
p00454_B,00454,B,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p00455_B,00455,B,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p00456_B,00456,B,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p00457_B,00457,B,in what way
p00458_B,00458,B,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p00459_B,00459,B,but the string never broke
p00460_B,00460,B,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p00461_B,00461,B,it has broken now
p00462_B,00462,B,broken what do you mean
p00463_B,00463,B,i meant that she is going to marry me
p00464_B,00464,B,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p00465_B,00465,B,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p00466_B,00466,B,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p00467_B,00467,B,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p00468_B,00468,B,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p00469_B,00469,B,grazie tante
p00470_B,00470,B,indeed i have mrs honeychurch i m going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally i m too shy i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother and now i want my tea
p00471_B,00471,B,you only asked for it just in time how dare you be serious at windy corner
p00472_B,00472,B,fiasco
p00473_B,00473,B,do you go to much of this sort of thing
p00474_B,00474,B,oh now and then
p00475_B,00475,B,is it typical of country society
p00476_B,00476,B,i suppose so mother would it be
p00477_B,00477,B,plenty of society
p00478_B,00478,B,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p00479_B,00479,B,i am so sorry that you were stranded
p00480_B,00480,B,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p00481_B,00481,B,one has to go through it i suppose they won t notice us so much next time
p00482_B,00482,B,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p00483_B,00483,B,how tiresome couldn t you have escaped to tennis
p00484_B,00484,B,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p00485_B,00485,B,inglese italianato
p00486_B,00486,B,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p00487_B,00487,B,we all have our limitations i suppose
p00488_B,00488,B,sometimes they are forced on us though
p00489_B,00489,B,how
p00490_B,00490,B,it makes a difference doesn t it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others
p00491_B,00491,B,we were speaking of motives
p00492_B,00492,B,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p00493_B,00493,B,we weren t talking of real fences
p00494_B,00494,B,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p00495_B,00495,B,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p00496_B,00496,B,don t you like mr beebe
p00497_B,00497,B,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p00498_B,00498,B,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p00499_B,00499,B,what sort of things
p00500_B,00500,B,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p00501_B,00501,B,perhaps he had
p00502_B,00502,B,no
p00503_B,00503,B,why
p00504_B,00504,B,he was such a nice old man i m sure well i did try to sift the thing mr eager would never come to the point he prefers it vague said the old man had practically murdered his wife had murdered her in the sight of god
p00505_B,00505,B,hush dear poor old man what was his name
p00506_B,00506,B,harris
p00507_B,00507,B,let s hope that mrs harris there warn t no sich person
p00508_B,00508,B,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p00509_B,00509,B,i don t know i hate him i ve heard him lecture on giotto i hate him nothing can hide a petty nature i hate him
p00510_B,00510,B,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p00511_B,00511,B,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p00512_B,00512,B,what height
p00513_B,00513,B,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p00514_B,00514,B,summer street of course
p00515_B,00515,B,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p00516_B,00516,B,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p00517_B,00517,B,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p00518_B,00518,B,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p00519_B,00519,B,turn her out
p00520_B,00520,B,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p00521_B,00521,B,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p00522_B,00522,B,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p00523_B,00523,B,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p00524_B,00524,B,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p00525_B,00525,B,yes i met them abroad
p00526_B,00526,B,gentlewomen
p00527_B,00527,B,yes indeed and at the present moment homeless i heard from them last week miss teresa and miss catharine alan i m really not joking they are quite the right people mr beebe knows them too may i tell them to write to you
p00528_B,00528,B,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p00529_B,00529,B,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p00530_B,00530,B,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p00531_B,00531,B,the misses alan aren t that
p00532_B,00532,B,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p00533_B,00533,B,don t listen to him sir harry he s tiresome
p00534_B,00534,B,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p00535_B,00535,B,then may i write to my misses alan
p00536_B,00536,B,please
p00537_B,00537,B,beware they are certain to have canaries sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come beware of women altogether only let to a man
p00538_B,00538,B,really
p00539_B,00539,B,men don t gossip over tea cups if they get drunk there s an end of them they lie down comfortably and sleep it off if they re vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves it doesn t spread so give me a man of course provided he s clean
p00540_B,00540,B,mrs honeychurch what if we two walk home and leave you
p00541_B,00541,B,certainly
p00542_B,00542,B,aha young people young people
p00543_B,00543,B,hopeless vulgarian
p00544_B,00544,B,oh cecil
p00545_B,00545,B,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p00546_B,00546,B,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p00547_B,00547,B,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p00548_B,00548,B,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p00549_B,00549,B,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p00550_B,00550,B,which way shall we go
p00551_B,00551,B,are there two ways
p00552_B,00552,B,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p00553_B,00553,B,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p00554_B,00554,B,haven t i the wood then
p00555_B,00555,B,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p00556_B,00556,B,a room
p00557_B,00557,B,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p00558_B,00558,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p00559_B,00559,B,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p00560_B,00560,B,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p00561_B,00561,B,a drawing room pray with no view
p00562_B,00562,B,yes with no view i fancy why not
p00563_B,00563,B,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p00564_B,00564,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p00565_B,00565,B,why do you call it that
p00566_B,00566,B,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p00567_B,00567,B,and you
p00568_B,00568,B,i bathed here too till i was found out then there was a row

p00605_B,00605,B,it s only another muddle of freddy s freddy doesn t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead
p00606_B,00606,B,yes i do i ve got it emerson

p00611_B,00611,B,i don t know whether they re any emersons
p00612_B,00612,B,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p00613_B,00613,B,emerson s a common enough name
p00614_B,00614,B,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p00615_B,00615,B,oh yes and you will be satisfied too for they re friends of cecil so you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety
p00616_B,00616,B,cecil
p00617_B,00617,B,don t be rude dear lucy don t screech it s a new bad habit you re getting into
p00618_B,00618,B,but has cecil
p00619_B,00619,B,friends of cecil s
p00620_B,00620,B,but cecil s emersons they can t possibly be the same ones there is that
p00621_B,00621,B,the emersons who were at florence do you mean no i don t suppose it will prove to be them it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyse s oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people the queerest people for our part we liked them didn t we
p00622_B,00622,B,fiasco s done you this time
p00623_B,00623,B,these particular emersons consisted of a father and a son the son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immature pessimism et cetera our special joy was the father such a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife
p00624_B,00624,B,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time
p00625_B,00625,B,oh don t go
p00626_B,00626,B,harris
p00627_B,00627,B,cecil
p00628_B,00628,B,hullo i was hoping you d come i heard you all bear gardening but there s better fun up here i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse george meredith s right the cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa don t be angry don t be angry you ll forgive me when you hear it all
p00629_B,00629,B,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p00630_B,00630,B,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p00631_B,00631,B,what an odd place to meet people i don t quite understand
p00632_B,00632,B,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p00633_B,00633,B,but cecil
p00634_B,00634,B,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p00635_B,00635,B,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before
p00636_B,00636,B,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p00637_B,00637,B,no you don t you don t know what the word means
p00638_B,00638,B,no you don t
p00639_B,00639,B,it isn t fair cecil i blame you i blame you very much indeed you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense i consider it most disloyal of you
p00640_B,00640,B,temper
p00641_B,00641,B,so you do love me little thing
p00642_B,00642,B,oh cecil i do i do i don t know what i should do without you
p00643_B,00643,B,now some beethoven
p00644_B,00644,B,make lucy one of us lucy is becoming wonderful wonderful
p00645_B,00645,B,her music always was wonderful
p00646_B,00646,B,yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made
p00647_B,00647,B,italy has done it
p00648_B,00648,B,perhaps it is just possible cecil mind you marry her next january she is one of us already
p00649_B,00649,B,but her music the style of her how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven schumann was right for this evening schumann was the thing do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and then not till then let them come to london i don t believe in these london educations at all events not for women
p00650_B,00650,B,make her one of us
p00651_B,00651,B,bad dreams
p00652_B,00652,B,just dreams

p00654_B,00654,B,m m

p00657_B,00657,B,i ll be down in a minute
p00658_B,00658,B,i fancy they know how to read a rare accomplishment what have they got byron exactly a shropshire lad never heard of it the way of all flesh never heard of it gibbon hullo dear george reads german um um schopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch
p00659_B,00659,B,mr beebe look at that
p00660_B,00660,B,i know isn t it jolly i like that i m certain that s the old man s doing
p00661_B,00661,B,how very odd of him
p00662_B,00662,B,surely you agree pictures giotto they got that at florence i ll be bound
p00663_B,00663,B,the same as lucy s got
p00664_B,00664,B,oh by the by did miss honeychurch enjoy london
p00665_B,00665,B,she came back yesterday
p00666_B,00666,B,i suppose she had a good time
p00667_B,00667,B,yes very she and cecil are thicker than ever
p00668_B,00668,B,that s good hearing
p00669_B,00669,B,i wish i wasn t such a fool mr beebe lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but it ll be very different now mother thinks she will read all kinds of books
p00670_B,00670,B,so will you
p00671_B,00671,B,only medical books not books that you can talk about afterwards cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed cecil says
p00672_B,00672,B,what on earth are those people doing upstairs emerson we think we ll come another time
p00673_B,00673,B,how d ye do come and have a bathe
p00674_B,00674,B,oh all right
p00675_B,00675,B,that s the best conversational opening i ve ever heard but i m afraid it will only act between men can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do come and have a bathe and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal
p00676_B,00676,B,we are to raise ladies to our level
p00677_B,00677,B,the garden of eden which you place in the past is really yet to come we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies in this not in other things we men are ahead we despise the body less than women do but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden
p00678_B,00678,B,i say what about this bathe
p00679_B,00679,B,i believed in a return to nature once but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her to day i believe that we must discover nature after many conquests we shall attain simplicity it is our heritage
p00680_B,00680,B,let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence
p00681_B,00681,B,how do you do very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry marriage is a duty i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too he has been most kind he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude ah this wind you do well to bathe yours is a glorious country honeychurch
p00682_B,00682,B,not a bit i must that is to say i have to have the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope
p00683_B,00683,B,call my lad who taught us that drawing room twaddle call on your grandmother listen to the wind among the pines yours is a glorious country
p00684_B,00684,B,mr emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval it does not count that i helped you with the stair eyes yesterday it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon
p00685_B,00685,B,yes go and bathe george why do you dawdle talking bring them back to tea bring back some milk cakes honey the change will do you good george has been working very hard at his office i can t believe he s well
p00686_B,00686,B,do you really want this bathe it is only a pond don t you know i dare say you are used to something better
p00687_B,00687,B,and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here
p00688_B,00688,B,i did not miss lavish told me
p00689_B,00689,B,when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose for example it isn t purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect
p00690_B,00690,B,it is i have reflected it is fate everything is fate we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fate flung together drawn apart the twelve winds blow us we settle nothing
p00691_B,00691,B,you have not reflected at all
p00692_B,00692,B,italy
p00693_B,00693,B,and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch
p00694_B,00694,B,national gallery
p00695_B,00695,B,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p00696_B,00696,B,it is fate that i am here but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy
p00697_B,00697,B,and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write we are all so glad that you have come
p00698_B,00698,B,here we are
p00699_B,00699,B,oh good
p00700_B,00700,B,in there s the pond i wish it was bigger

p00734_B,00734,B,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p00735_B,00735,B,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p00736_B,00736,B,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p00737_B,00737,B,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p00738_B,00738,B,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p00739_B,00739,B,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p00740_B,00740,B,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p00741_B,00741,B,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p00742_B,00742,B,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p00743_B,00743,B,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p00744_B,00744,B,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p00745_B,00745,B,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p00746_B,00746,B,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p00747_B,00747,B,we mustn t be unjust to people
p00748_B,00748,B,go and dress dear you ll be late

p00761_B,00761,B,all right
p00762_B,00762,B,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p00763_B,00763,B,her what
p00764_B,00764,B,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p00765_B,00765,B,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p00766_B,00766,B,come here old lady thank you for putting away my bonnet kiss me
p00767_B,00767,B,i saw him in florence
p00768_B,00768,B,is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap
p00769_B,00769,B,ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here
p00770_B,00770,B,he is the clever sort like myself
p00771_B,00771,B,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p00772_B,00772,B,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p00773_B,00773,B,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p00774_B,00774,B,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p00775_B,00775,B,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p00776_B,00776,B,she was a novelist
p00777_B,00777,B,this year next year now never
p00778_B,00778,B,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p00779_B,00779,B,i tore the thing up
p00780_B,00780,B,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p00781_B,00781,B,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p00782_B,00782,B,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p00783_B,00783,B,so would i
p00784_B,00784,B,and i have been thinking surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at tunbridge wells finish i have not seen poor charlotte for so long
p00785_B,00785,B,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p00786_B,00786,B,nonsense it can
p00787_B,00787,B,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p00788_B,00788,B,minnie can sleep with you
p00789_B,00789,B,i won t have her
p00790_B,00790,B,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p00791_B,00791,B,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett
p00792_B,00792,B,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p00793_B,00793,B,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p00794_B,00794,B,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p00795_B,00795,B,hear hear
p00796_B,00796,B,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p00797_B,00797,B,i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right
p00798_B,00798,B,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p00799_B,00799,B,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p00800_B,00800,B,from your own account you told her as much
p00801_B,00801,B,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p00802_B,00802,B,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p00803_B,00803,B,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p00804_B,00804,B,may me and lucy get down from our chairs we don t want no dessert
p00805_B,00805,B,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p00806_B,00806,B,yes he is waking up
p00807_B,00807,B,just what i ve been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour
p00808_B,00808,B,i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor
p00809_B,00809,B,all right if you d really rather five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver
p00810_B,00810,B,but who am i to give the sovereign to
p00811_B,00811,B,let s leave it all till mother comes back
p00812_B,00812,B,no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts please please i know i am a sad spoil sport but it would make me wretched i should practically be robbing the one who lost
p00813_B,00813,B,freddy owes me fifteen shillings so it will work out right if you give the pound to me
p00814_B,00814,B,fifteen shillings how is that mr vyse
p00815_B,00815,B,because don t you see freddy paid your cab give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling
p00816_B,00816,B,but i don t see that i don t see why mr vyse is to have the quid but i don t see no thank you i m done i don t see why freddy don t poke me miss honeychurch your brother s hurting me ow what about mr floyd s ten shillings ow no i don t see and i never shall see why miss what s her name shouldn t pay that bob for the driver
p00817_B,00817,B,i had forgotten the driver thank you dear for reminding me a shilling was it can any one give me change for half a crown
p00818_B,00818,B,i ll get it cecil give me that sovereign no give me up that sovereign i ll get euphemia to change it and we ll start the whole thing again from the beginning
p00819_B,00819,B,lucy lucy what a nuisance i am
p00820_B,00820,B,no i haven t let me see a sovereign s worth of silver no i haven t told cecil or any one i promised you i shouldn t here is your money all shillings except two half crowns would you count it you can settle your debt nicely now
p00821_B,00821,B,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p00822_B,00822,B,oh no charlotte george emerson is all right and what other source is there
p00823_B,00823,B,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p00824_B,00824,B,we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren t careful how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil
p00825_B,00825,B,we must think of every possibility
p00826_B,00826,B,oh it s all right
p00827_B,00827,B,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p00828_B,00828,B,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it
p00829_B,00829,B,to contradict it
p00830_B,00830,B,no to laugh at it
p00831_B,00831,B,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p00832_B,00832,B,now charlotte
p00833_B,00833,B,i am no match for you in conversation dearest i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am you will never forgive me
p00834_B,00834,B,shall we go out then they will smash all the china if we don t
p00835_B,00835,B,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p00836_B,00836,B,yes i have
p00837_B,00837,B,what happened
p00838_B,00838,B,we met at the rectory
p00839_B,00839,B,what line is he taking up
p00840_B,00840,B,no line he talked about italy like any other person it is really all right what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly i do wish i could make you see it my way he really won t be any nuisance charlotte
p00841_B,00841,B,once a cad always a cad that is my poor opinion
p00842_B,00842,B,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p00843_B,00843,B,once a cad always a cad
p00844_B,00844,B,what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised i don t think we ought to blame him very much it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesn t admire me or any of that nonsense one straw freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself he has improved he doesn t always look as if he s going to burst into tears he is a clerk in the general manager s office at one of the big railways not a porter and runs down to his father for week ends papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired there now for the garden suppose we don t talk about this silly italian business any more we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting
p00845_B,00845,B,lucy lucy what s that book who s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil
p00846_B,00846,B,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p00847_B,00847,B,but pick it up and don t stand idling there like a flamingo
p00848_B,00848,B,oh mrs honeychurch
p00849_B,00849,B,minnie don t be late here comes the horse where s charlotte run up and hurry her why is she so long she had nothing to do she never brings anything but blouses poor charlotte how i do detest blouses minnie
p00850_B,00850,B,yes easily jump in gracious me how smart you look what a lovely frock you put us all to shame
p00851_B,00851,B,if i did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should i wear them
p00852_B,00852,B,introduce me unless the young man considers that he knows me already
p00853_B,00853,B,i believe that there was some misunderstanding
p00854_B,00854,B,our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person he thought we should be artistic he is disappointed
p00855_B,00855,B,oh stop now you have come
p00856_B,00856,B,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p00857_B,00857,B,there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world
p00858_B,00858,B,yes that s exactly what i say why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans
p00859_B,00859,B,there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows choose a place where you won t do harm yes choose a place where you won t do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine
p00860_B,00860,B,oh mr emerson i see you re clever
p00861_B,00861,B,eh
p00862_B,00862,B,i see you re going to be clever i hope you didn t go behaving like that to poor freddy
p00863_B,00863,B,no i didn t he behaved that way to me it is his philosophy only he starts life with it and i have tried the note of interrogation first
p00864_B,00864,B,what do you mean no never mind what you mean don t explain he looks forward to seeing you this afternoon do you play tennis do you mind tennis on sunday
p00865_B,00865,B,george mind tennis on sunday george after his education distinguish between sunday
p00866_B,00866,B,very well george doesn t mind tennis on sunday no more do i that s settled mr emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased and then he wants to give up his house to the miss alans

p00889_B,00889,B,i shall want to live i tell you
p00890_B,00890,B,dreadful
p00891_B,00891,B,the scene is laid in florence
p00892_B,00892,B,what fun cecil read away come mr emerson sit down after all your energy
p00893_B,00893,B,you and are you tired
p00894_B,00894,B,of course i m not
p00895_B,00895,B,do you mind being beaten
p00896_B,00896,B,yes i don t see you re such a splendid player though the light was behind you and it was in my eyes
p00897_B,00897,B,i never said i was
p00898_B,00898,B,why you did
p00899_B,00899,B,you didn t attend
p00900_B,00900,B,you said oh don t go in for accuracy at this house we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who don t leonora is leonora the heroine who s the book by
p00901_B,00901,B,joseph emery prank
p00902_B,00902,B,indeed why it s miss lavish it s miss lavish s novel and she s publishing it under somebody else s name
p00903_B,00903,B,who may miss lavish be
p00904_B,00904,B,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p00905_B,00905,B,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p00906_B,00906,B,weren t you pleased no wonder the novel s bad i never liked miss lavish but i suppose one ought to read it as one s met her
p00907_B,00907,B,all modern books are bad every one writes for money in these days
p00908_B,00908,B,oh cecil
p00909_B,00909,B,it is so i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p00910_B,00910,B,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p00911_B,00911,B,i never notice much difference in views
p00912_B,00912,B,what do you mean
p00913_B,00913,B,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p00914_B,00914,B,h m
p00915_B,00915,B,my father says that there is only one perfect view the view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it
p00916_B,00916,B,i expect your father has been reading dante
p00917_B,00917,B,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills
p00918_B,00918,B,what a splendid idea i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again i m so sorry he s not so well
p00919_B,00919,B,no he isn t well
p00920_B,00920,B,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p00921_B,00921,B,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p00922_B,00922,B,none why
p00923_B,00923,B,you spoke of
p00924_B,00924,B,my mother i was meaning
p00925_B,00925,B,oh cecil how you made me jump
p00926_B,00926,B,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p00927_B,00927,B,i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead it is the first thing that i remember cecil do read the thing about the view
p00928_B,00928,B,not while mr emerson is here to entertain us
p00929_B,00929,B,no read away i think nothing s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go
p00930_B,00930,B,mr emerson go and find tennis balls
p00931_B,00931,B,am i really to go
p00932_B,00932,B,no of course not really
p00933_B,00933,B,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book
p00934_B,00934,B,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p00935_B,00935,B,this isn t the passage i wanted there is another much funnier further on
p00936_B,00936,B,should we go in to tea
p00937_B,00937,B,dear
p00938_B,00938,B,do you know about it please they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance
p00939_B,00939,B,my good lucia i am all at sea i know nothing about it whatever
p00940_B,00940,B,there are violets i cannot believe it is a coincidence charlotte charlotte how could you have told her i have thought before speaking it must be you
p00941_B,00941,B,told her what
p00942_B,00942,B,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p00943_B,00943,B,oh lucy dearest girl she hasn t put that in her book
p00944_B,00944,B,not so that one could recognize it yes
p00945_B,00945,B,then never never never more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00946_B,00946,B,so you did tell
p00947_B,00947,B,i did just happen when i had tea with her at rome in the course of conversation
p00948_B,00948,B,but charlotte what about the promise you gave me when we were packing why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldn t even let me tell mother
p00949_B,00949,B,i will never forgive eleanor she has betrayed my confidence
p00950_B,00950,B,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p00951_B,00951,B,oh lucy i shall never forgive myself never to my dying day fancy if your prospects
p00952_B,00952,B,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p00953_B,00953,B,i always said he was a cad dear give me credit for that at all events from the very first moment when he said his father was having a bath
p00954_B,00954,B,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p00955_B,00955,B,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p00956_B,00956,B,i want something more definite will you speak to him it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word
p00957_B,00957,B,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p00958_B,00958,B,yes or no please yes or no
p00959_B,00959,B,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle
p00960_B,00960,B,very well no one will help me i will speak to him myself
p00961_B,00961,B,freddy has taken him into the dining room the others are going down the garden come let us get this over quickly come i want you in the room of course
p00962_B,00962,B,lucy do you mind doing it
p00963_B,00963,B,how can you ask such a ridiculous question
p00964_B,00964,B,poor lucy i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go
p00965_B,00965,B,no nothing to eat
p00966_B,00966,B,you go down to the others charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants where s mother
p00967_B,00967,B,she s started on her sunday writing she s in the drawing room
p00968_B,00968,B,that s all right you go away
p00969_B,00969,B,what
p00970_B,00970,B,no discussion
p00971_B,00971,B,but i can t
p00972_B,00972,B,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p00973_B,00973,B,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p00974_B,00974,B,you are merely ridiculous
p00975_B,00975,B,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p00976_B,00976,B,i can scarcely discuss
p00977_B,00977,B,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p00978_B,00978,B,you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit
p00979_B,00979,B,yes i have i m the same kind of brute at bottom this desire to govern a woman it lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden but i do love you surely in a better way than he does
p00980_B,00980,B,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p00981_B,00981,B,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p00982_B,00982,B,oh lucia come back here oh what an awful man
p00983_B,00983,B,well he amuses me either i m mad or else he is and i m inclined to think it s the latter one more fuss through with you charlotte many thanks i think though that this is the last my admirer will hardly trouble me again
p00984_B,00984,B,well it isn t everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it oh one oughtn t to laugh really it might have been very serious but you were so sensible and brave so unlike the girls of my day
p00985_B,00985,B,let s go down to them
p00986_B,00986,B,mr emerson has had to go
p00987_B,00987,B,what a nuisance that spoils the four i say cecil do play do there s a good chap it s floyd s last day do play tennis with us just this once
p00988_B,00988,B,my dear freddy i am no athlete as you well remarked this very morning i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you
p00989_B,00989,B,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p00990_B,00990,B,different how how
p00991_B,00991,B,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should
p00992_B,00992,B,i don t understand you you aren t like yourself you re tired lucy
p00993_B,00993,B,tired that is exactly like you you always think women don t mean what they say
p00994_B,00994,B,well you sound tired as if something has worried you
p00995_B,00995,B,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p00996_B,00996,B,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p00997_B,00997,B,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p00998_B,00998,B,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p00999_B,00999,B,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p01000_B,01000,B,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p01001_B,01001,B,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p01002_B,01002,B,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p01003_B,01003,B,what s the good of a scene
p01004_B,01004,B,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p01005_B,01005,B,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p01006_B,01006,B,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p01007_B,01007,B,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p01008_B,01008,B,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p01009_B,01009,B,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p01010_B,01010,B,it is true
p01011_B,01011,B,true on the whole
p01012_B,01012,B,true every word it is a revelation it is i
p01013_B,01013,B,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p01014_B,01014,B,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p01015_B,01015,B,what do you mean by a new voice
p01016_B,01016,B,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p01017_B,01017,B,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p01018_B,01018,B,of course i don t think that you are not that kind lucy
p01019_B,01019,B,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p01020_B,01020,B,i may have said that in the past i shall never say it again you have taught me better of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadn t known of up till now
p01021_B,01021,B,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p01022_B,01022,B,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p01023_B,01023,B,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness
p01024_B,01024,B,let me light your candle shall i thank you good night again god bless you lucy
p01025_B,01025,B,good bye cecil
p01026_B,01026,B,yes
p01027_B,01027,B,i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch isn t it wonderful isn t it romance most certainly they will go to constantinople they are taken in a snare that cannot fail they will end by going round the world isn t romance capricious i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn no ordinary view will content the miss alans they want the pension keats
p01028_B,01028,B,i m awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe but have you any matches
p01029_B,01029,B,i have
p01030_B,01030,B,you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse
p01031_B,01031,B,never
p01032_B,01032,B,then you don t see the wonder of this greek visit i haven t been to greece myself and don t mean to go and i can t imagine any of my friends going it is altogether too big for our little lot don t you think so italy is just about as much as we can manage italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilish i am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus all right freddy i am not being clever upon my word i am not i took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when you ve done with them i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian big enough in all conscience the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me there the contrast is just as much as i can realize but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria
p01033_B,01033,B,you re quite right greece is not for our little lot
p01034_B,01034,B,i m so glad you only talked about books cecil s hard hit lucy won t marry him if you d gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down
p01035_B,01035,B,but when
p01036_B,01036,B,late last night i must go
p01037_B,01037,B,perhaps they won t want me down there
p01038_B,01038,B,no go on good bye
p01039_B,01039,B,thank goodness it was the one foolish thing she ever did oh what a glorious riddance
p01040_B,01040,B,how do you do
p01041_B,01041,B,here lennie the bass
p01042_B,01042,B,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may
p01043_B,01043,B,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p01044_B,01044,B,it is terrible this havoc among the flowers
p01045_B,01045,B,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p01046_B,01046,B,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p01047_B,01047,B,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p01048_B,01048,B,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p01049_B,01049,B,don t be a prig go and put on your boots
p01050_B,01050,B,i don t think i will thank you
p01051_B,01051,B,no i didn t suppose you would care to much how delicate those sonatas are miss honeychurch
p01052_B,01052,B,yes
p01053_B,01053,B,i met them on the hill your brother told me
p01054_B,01054,B,oh he did
p01055_B,01055,B,i needn t say that it will go no further
p01056_B,01056,B,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p01057_B,01057,B,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p01058_B,01058,B,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p01059_B,01059,B,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p01060_B,01060,B,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p01061_B,01061,B,i am very sorry for that
p01062_B,01062,B,and freddy minds
p01063_B,01063,B,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p01064_B,01064,B,boys are so odd
p01065_B,01065,B,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p01066_B,01066,B,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p01067_B,01067,B,next week i gather
p01068_B,01068,B,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p01069_B,01069,B,no he didn t
p01070_B,01070,B,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p01071_B,01071,B,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p01072_B,01072,B,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p01073_B,01073,B,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p01074_B,01074,B,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p01075_B,01075,B,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p01076_B,01076,B,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p01077_B,01077,B,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p01078_B,01078,B,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p01079_B,01079,B,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p01080_B,01080,B,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p01081_B,01081,B,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p01082_B,01082,B,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p01083_B,01083,B,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p01084_B,01084,B,but i must go somewhere i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing i must and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring you all think much too highly of me i wish you weren t so kind
p01085_B,01085,B,come along tea tea tea
p01086_B,01086,B,lucy can always play
p01087_B,01087,B,one is very thankful that she has such a resource she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be i know all about it the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak
p01088_B,01088,B,i wonder
p01089_B,01089,B,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p01090_B,01090,B,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p01091_B,01091,B,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p01092_B,01092,B,quite so
p01093_B,01093,B,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p01094_B,01094,B,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p01095_B,01095,B,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p01096_B,01096,B,really now why
p01097_B,01097,B,she wanted to leave windy corner
p01098_B,01098,B,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p01099_B,01099,B,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p01100_B,01100,B,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p01101_B,01101,B,you may well ask that why greece what is it minnie dear jam why not tunbridge wells oh mr beebe i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning i cannot help her i will say no more perhaps i have already said too much i am not to talk i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused
p01102_B,01102,B,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p01103_B,01103,B,very well i for one will help her to go to greece will you it is absolutely necessary i know i know she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes i trust that the servants know nothing afterwards but i may have said too much already only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone if you help we may succeed otherwise
p01104_B,01104,B,otherwise
p01105_B,01105,B,otherwise
p01106_B,01106,B,yes i will help her come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up
p01107_B,01107,B,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p01108_B,01108,B,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful
p01109_B,01109,B,so am i
p01110_B,01110,B,good now come up to the house
p01111_B,01111,B,i don t see why greece is necessary but as you do i suppose it is all right it must be something i can t understand lucy let s tell her lucy
p01112_B,01112,B,she is playing the piano i didn t know that miss honeychurch sang too
p01113_B,01113,B,it s a song that cecil gave her how odd girls are
p01114_B,01114,B,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p01115_B,01115,B,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p01116_B,01116,B,oh splendid oh thank you
p01117_B,01117,B,here s mr beebe
p01118_B,01118,B,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p01119_B,01119,B,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p01120_B,01120,B,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p01121_B,01121,B,i suspected it was unscholarly it s so beautiful
p01122_B,01122,B,the tune s right enough but the words are rotten why throw up the sponge
p01123_B,01123,B,how stupidly you talk
p01124_B,01124,B,this has been a day and a half
p01125_B,01125,B,wait a minute she is finishing
p01126_B,01126,B,i love weather like this
p01127_B,01127,B,or does his work keep him in london
p01128_B,01128,B,however we shall see him when he sees you off i do so long to see him
p01129_B,01129,B,no one will see lucy off she doesn t like it
p01130_B,01130,B,no i hate seeings off
p01131_B,01131,B,really how funny i should have thought that in this case
p01132_B,01132,B,oh mrs honeychurch you aren t going it is such a pleasure to have met you
p01133_B,01133,B,that s all right we just got through that time
p01134_B,01134,B,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p01135_B,01135,B,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p01136_B,01136,B,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p01137_B,01137,B,it s only for a few days
p01138_B,01138,B,but why at all
p01139_B,01139,B,because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears i ve given up cecil may begin again
p01140_B,01140,B,i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly
p01141_B,01141,B,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p01142_B,01142,B,half a minute would be nearer
p01143_B,01143,B,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p01144_B,01144,B,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p01145_B,01145,B,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p01146_B,01146,B,i want more independence
p01147_B,01147,B,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p01148_B,01148,B,perhaps i spoke hastily
p01149_B,01149,B,oh goodness how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett
p01150_B,01150,B,charlotte
p01151_B,01151,B,more every moment
p01152_B,01152,B,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p01153_B,01153,B,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p01154_B,01154,B,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p01155_B,01155,B,there you go
p01156_B,01156,B,i beg your pardon
p01157_B,01157,B,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p01158_B,01158,B,my point is that you oughtn t to have asked charlotte to stop i wish you would keep to the point the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isn t raining oh for a little air
p01159_B,01159,B,very well old lady stop the horse

p01170_B,01170,B,i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son
p01171_B,01171,B,but you do remember it
p01172_B,01172,B,he has misbehaved himself from the first
p01173_B,01173,B,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p01174_B,01174,B,why he has behaved abominably i am glad he is sorry do you know what he did
p01175_B,01175,B,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p01176_B,01176,B,no of course is much too strong i am sorry i used it about your son i think i will go to church after all my mother and my cousin have gone i shall not be so very late
p01177_B,01177,B,especially as he has gone under
p01178_B,01178,B,what was that
p01179_B,01179,B,gone under naturally
p01180_B,01180,B,i don t understand
p01181_B,01181,B,as his mother did
p01182_B,01182,B,but mr emerson mr emerson what are you talking about
p01183_B,01183,B,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p01184_B,01184,B,i don t know i don t understand this sort of thing i was not meant to understand it
p01185_B,01185,B,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p01186_B,01186,B,oh how terrible
p01187_B,01187,B,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p01188_B,01188,B,i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair i am deeply sorry about it
p01189_B,01189,B,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p01190_B,01190,B,mr emerson don t leave at least not on my account i am going to greece don t leave your comfortable house

p01193_B,01193,B,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p01194_B,01194,B,oh mr emerson you mustn t i ve been bother enough to the world by now i can t have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through it all on my account you must stop i am just going to greece

p01199_B,01199,B,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow

p01216_B,01216,B,you are leaving him you are leaving the man you love
p01217_B,01217,B,i i had to
p01218_B,01218,B,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p01219_B,01219,B,how dare you oh how like a man i mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man
p01220_B,01220,B,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy
p01221_B,01221,B,you ve frightened me cecil mr beebe the ticket s bought everything i m caught in the tangle i must suffer and grow old away from him i cannot break the whole of life for his sake they trusted me give george my love once only tell him
p01222_B,01222,B,lucy
p01223_B,01223,B,no they are in the hall oh please not mr emerson they trust me
p01224_B,01224,B,but why should they when you have deceived them

p01226_B,01226,B,what s that
p01227_B,01227,B,i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you
p01228_B,01228,B,one minute mother

p01235_B,01235,B,mr beebe could you help me
p01236_B,01236,B,i am more grieved than i can possibly express it is lamentable lamentable incredible
p01237_B,01237,B,what s wrong with the boy
p01238_B,01238,B,nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me marry george miss honeychurch he will do admirably
p01239_B,01239,B,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p01240_B,01240,B,you kiss me you kiss me i will try
p01241_B,01241,B,why shouldn t i be a baby
p01242_B,01242,B,oh bother charlotte what can such people be made of
p01243_B,01243,B,same stuff as parsons are made of
p01244_B,01244,B,nonsense
p01245_B,01245,B,quite right it is nonsense
p01246_B,01246,B,now you get up off the cold floor or you ll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly
p01247_B,01247,B,why shouldn t i laugh what s there to cry at kiss me here any letters
p01248_B,01248,B,just a line from freddy
p01249_B,01249,B,now kiss me here then here lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows
p01250_B,01250,B,san miniato i ll just finish your sock
p01251_B,01251,B,anything good in freddy s letter
p01252_B,01252,B,not yet
p01253_B,01253,B,what does he say
p01254_B,01254,B,silly boy he thinks he s being dignified he knew we should go off in the spring he has known it for six months that if mother wouldn t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement ridiculous boy
p01255_B,01255,B,but it will all come right in the end he has to build us both up from the beginning again i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women he has for the second time quite altered why will men have theories about women i haven t any about men i wish too that mr beebe
p01256_B,01256,B,you may well wish that
p01257_B,01257,B,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p01258_B,01258,B,perhaps well i acted the truth the only thing i did do and you came back to me so possibly you know nonsense with that sock
p01259_B,01259,B,oh bother that man
p01260_B,01260,B,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p01261_B,01261,B,look at the lights going over the bridge
p01262_B,01262,B,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p01263_B,01263,B,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p01264_B,01264,B,oh no she didn t see him she was upstairs with old mrs beebe don t you remember and then went straight to the church she said so
p01265_B,01265,B,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p01266_B,01266,B,how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment
p01267_B,01267,B,or did she mean it
p01268_B,01268,B,mean what
p01269_B,01269,B,lascia prego lascia siamo sposati
p01270_B,01270,B,scusi tanto signora buona sera e grazie
p01271_B,01271,B,niente
p01272_B,01272,B,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p01273_B,01273,B,it is impossible no it is just possible
