p00000_A,00000,A,quite an ovation they ll take us for royalty oh mr kingcroft get us foot warmers
p00001_A,00001,A,remember that it is only by going off the track that you get to know the country see the little towns gubbio pienza cortona san gemignano monteriano and don t let me beg you go with that awful tourist idea that italy s only a museum of antiquities and art love and understand the italians for the people are more marvellous than the land
p00002_A,00002,A,how i wish you were coming philip
p00003_A,00003,A,i wish i were

p00005_A,00005,A,i ll do my best
p00006_A,00006,A,she is sure to be good
p00007_A,00007,A,caroline my caroline jump in or your chaperon will go off without you
p00008_A,00008,A,handkerchiefs and collars in my inlaid box i ve lent you my inlaid box
p00009_A,00009,A,good bye mrs charles may you enjoy yourself and may god bless you
p00010_A,00010,A,oh i am so sorry but you do look so funny oh you all look so funny waving oh pray
p00011_A,00011,A,high spirits to begin so long a journey
p00012_A,00012,A,i wish that mrs charles had gotten the footwarmer these london porters won t take heed to a country chap
p00013_A,00013,A,but you did your best and i think it simply noble of you to have brought mrs theobald all the way here on such a day as this
p00014_A,00014,A,and granny when will the old ship get to italy
p00015_A,00015,A,grandmother dear not granny and we say a boat or a steamer not a ship ships have sails and mother won t go all the way by sea you look at the map of europe and you ll see why harriet take her go with aunt harriet and she ll show you the map
p00016_A,00016,A,righto
p00017_A,00017,A,here beginneth the new life
p00018_A,00018,A,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her
p00019_A,00019,A,and alas alas a look of old mrs theobald what appalling apparition was that i did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile why ever did she come
p00020_A,00020,A,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way
p00021_A,00021,A,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells
p00022_A,00022,A,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her
p00023_A,00023,A,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public
p00024_A,00024,A,when a man is neither well bred nor well connected nor handsome nor clever nor rich even lilia may discard him in time
p00025_A,00025,A,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch
p00026_A,00026,A,my dear boy if possible she has got worse and worse it was your idea of italian travel that saved us
p00027_A,00027,A,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there
p00028_A,00028,A,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera
p00029_A,00029,A,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her
p00030_A,00030,A,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it
p00031_A,00031,A,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable
p00032_A,00032,A,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose
p00033_A,00033,A,there is santa deodata one of the most beautiful churches in italy
p00034_A,00034,A,of course i mean an english church lilia promised me that she would always be in a large town on sundays
p00035_A,00035,A,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe
p00036_A,00036,A,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching
p00037_A,00037,A,every one to his taste
p00038_A,00038,A,one moment irma i m going to the station i ll give you the pleasure of my company
p00039_A,00039,A,we will save the peas to the last they are the greatest fun
p00040_A,00040,A,it s a shame mother philip laughs at everything the book club the debating society the progressive whist the bazaars people won t like it we have our reputation a house divided against itself cannot stand
p00041_A,00041,A,let philip say what he likes and he will let us do what we like it s twelve the second post s in run and see if there are any letters
p00042_A,00042,A,let s finish the peas there won t be any letters
p00043_A,00043,A,no dear please go i ll sow the peas but you shall cover them up and mind the birds don t see em
p00044_A,00044,A,actually old mrs theobald
p00045_A,00045,A,read me the letter my hands are dirty how intolerable the crested paper is
p00046_A,00046,A,i don t understand it doesn t make sense
p00047_A,00047,A,her letters never did
p00048_A,00048,A,but it must be sillier than usual look here read it mother i can t make head or tail
p00049_A,00049,A,what is the difficulty what is it that puzzles you in this letter
p00050_A,00050,A,the meaning
p00051_A,00051,A,the meaning is quite clear lilia is engaged to be married don t cry dear please me by not crying don t talk at all it s more than i could bear she is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel take the letter and read for yourself how dare she not tell me direct how dare she write first to yorkshire pray am i to hear through mrs theobald a patronizing insolent letter like this have i no claim at all bear witness dear bear witness that for this i ll never forgive her
p00052_A,00052,A,oh what is to be done what is to be done
p00053_A,00053,A,this first next a telegram for lilia no a telegram for miss caroline abbott she too has something to explain
p00054_A,00054,A,oh what is to be done
p00055_A,00055,A,if there is an office there we might get an answer this evening since philip is back at seven and the eight fifteen catches the midnight boat at dover harriet when you go with this get 100 pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank go dear at once do not talk i see irma coming back go quickly well irma dear and whose team are you in this afternoon miss edith s or miss may s
p00056_A,00056,A,your feet grow larger every day
p00057_A,00057,A,it is too bad it s ridiculous to read dear she s not trying to marry any one in the place some tourist obviously who s stopping in the hotel the place has nothing to do with it at all
p00058_A,00058,A,but what a place to go to what nice person too do you meet in a hotel
p00059_A,00059,A,the man may be a duke or he may be an organ grinder that is not the point if lilia marries him she insults the memory of charles she insults irma she insults us therefore i forbid her and if she disobeys we have done with her for ever
p00060_A,00060,A,are we to talk it over now
p00061_A,00061,A,certainly please if you will be so very kind
p00062_A,00062,A,then how long has she been engaged
p00063_A,00063,A,a short time quite a short time
p00064_A,00064,A,i should like to know how long if you can remember
p00065_A,00065,A,exactly eleven days
p00066_A,00066,A,how long have you been here
p00067_A,00067,A,close on three weeks
p00068_A,00068,A,did you know him before you came
p00069_A,00069,A,no
p00070_A,00070,A,oh who is he
p00071_A,00071,A,a native of the place
p00072_A,00072,A,i understood they met at the hotel
p00073_A,00073,A,it was a mistake of mrs theobald s
p00074_A,00074,A,i also understand that he is a member of the italian nobility may i be told his name
p00075_A,00075,A,carella
p00076_A,00076,A,carella conte or marchese or what
p00077_A,00077,A,signor
p00078_A,00078,A,perhaps i bore you with these questions if so i will stop
p00079_A,00079,A,oh no please not at all i am here my own idea to give all information which you very naturally and to see if somehow please ask anything you like
p00080_A,00080,A,then how old is he
p00081_A,00081,A,oh quite young twenty one i believe
p00082_A,00082,A,good lord
p00083_A,00083,A,one would never believe it he looks much older
p00084_A,00084,A,and is he good looking
p00085_A,00085,A,very good looking all his features are good and he is well built though i dare say english standards would find him too short
p00086_A,00086,A,may i conclude that you like him
p00087_A,00087,A,as far as i have seen him i do as far as i have seen him i do like him
p00088_A,00088,A,what is he please you haven t told me that what s his position
p00089_A,00089,A,no position at all he is kicking his heels as my father would say you see he has only just finished his military service
p00090_A,00090,A,as a private
p00091_A,00091,A,i suppose so there is general conscription he was in the bersaglieri i think isn t that the crack regiment
p00092_A,00092,A,the men in it must be short and broad they must also be able to walk six miles an hour
p00093_A,00093,A,and now like most young men he is looking out for something to do
p00094_A,00094,A,meanwhile
p00095_A,00095,A,meanwhile like most young men he lives with his people father mother two sisters and a tiny tot of a brother
p00096_A,00096,A,one more question and only one more what is his father
p00097_A,00097,A,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven
p00098_A,00098,A,yes miss abbott i know but i am anxious to hear heaven s choice you arouse my curiosity is my sister in law to marry an angel
p00099_A,00099,A,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist
p00100_A,00100,A,i cannot think what is in the air if lilia was determined to disgrace us she might have found a less repulsive way a boy of medium height with a pretty face the son of a dentist at monteriano have i put it correctly may i surmise that he has not got one penny may i also surmise that his social position is nil furthermore
p00101_A,00101,A,stop i ll tell you no more
p00102_A,00102,A,really miss abbott it is a little late for reticence you have equipped me admirably
p00103_A,00103,A,dear caroline what an angel you ve been to tell him he takes it so well but you must have had a mauvais quart d heure
p00104_A,00104,A,england is a great country the italians love england and the english italy too is a great country she has produced many famous men for example garibaldi and dante the latter wrote the inferno the purgatorio the paradiso the inferno is the most beautiful
p00105_A,00105,A,oh look the poor wee fish
p00106_A,00106,A,but may not the fish die they have no air
p00107_A,00107,A,fish live on water not on air
p00108_A,00108,A,well philip i am sure you are ready for by bye we shall meet at twelve o clock lunch tomorrow if we don t meet before they give us caffe later in our rooms
p00109_A,00109,A,my dear lilia don t let s have a scene before i arrived i thought i might have to question you it is unnecessary i know everything miss abbott has told me a certain amount and the rest i see for myself
p00110_A,00110,A,see for yourself
p00111_A,00111,A,that he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad
p00112_A,00112,A,there are no cads in italy he is the son of a dentist why not
p00113_A,00113,A,thank you for the information i know everything as i told you before i am also aware of the social position of an italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town
p00114_A,00114,A,indeed philip you surprise me i understood you went in for equality and so on
p00115_A,00115,A,and i understood that signor carella was a member of the italian nobility
p00116_A,00116,A,well we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear mrs herriton but it is true he is a younger branch of course families ramify just as in yours there is your cousin joseph gino s father is courtesy itself and rising rapidly in his profession this very month he leaves monteriano and sets up at poggibonsi and for my own poor part i think what people are is what matters but i don t suppose you ll agree and i should like you to know that gino s uncle is a priest the same as a clergyman at home well his cousin s a lawyer at rome
p00117_A,00117,A,what kind of lawyer
p00118_A,00118,A,why a lawyer just like you are except that he has lots to do and can never get away
p00119_A,00119,A,the whole thing is like a bad dream so bad that it cannot go on if there was one redeeming feature about the man i might be uneasy as it is i can trust to time for the moment lilia he has taken you in but you will find him out soon it is not possible that you a lady accustomed to ladies and gentlemen will tolerate a man whose position is well not equal to the son of the servants dentist in coronation place i am not blaming you now but i blame the glamour of italy i have felt it myself you know and i greatly blame miss abbott
p00120_A,00120,A,caroline why blame her what s all this to do with caroline
p00121_A,00121,A,because we expected her to so i am confident and you in your heart agree that this engagement will not last think of your life at home think of irma and i ll also say think of us for you know lilia that we count you more than a relation i should feel i was losing my own sister if you did this and my mother would lose a daughter
p00122_A,00122,A,i can t break it off now
p00123_A,00123,A,poor lilia i know it may be painful but i have come to rescue you and book worm though i may be i am not frightened to stand up to a bully he s merely an insolent boy he thinks he can keep you to your word by threats he will be different when he sees he has a man to deal with
p00124_A,00124,A,for once in my life i ll thank you to leave me alone i ll thank your mother too for twelve years you ve trained me and tortured me and i ll stand it no more do you think i m a fool do you think i never felt ah when i came to your house a poor young bride how you all looked me over never a kind word and discussed me and thought i might just do and your mother corrected me and your sister snubbed me and you said funny things about me to show how clever you were and when charles died i was still to run in strings for the honour of your beastly family and i was to be cooped up at sawston and learn to keep house and all my chances spoilt of marrying again no thank you no thank you bully insolent boy who s that pray but you but thank goodness i can stand up against the world now for i ve found gino and this time i marry for love
p00125_A,00125,A,yes and i forbid you to do it you despise me perhaps and think i m feeble but you re mistaken you are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible but i will save you in order to save irma and our name there is going to be such a row in this town that you and he ll be sorry you came to it i shall shrink from nothing for my blood is up it is unwise of you to laugh i forbid you to marry carella and i shall tell him so now
p00126_A,00126,A,tell him so now have it out with him gino gino come in avanti fra filippo forbids the banns fra filippo s blood s up he shrinks from nothing oh take care he doesn t hurt you
p00127_A,00127,A,please sit down signor carella mrs herriton is rather agitated but there is no reason we should not be calm might i offer you a cigarette please sit down signor carella i will be frank with you i have come to prevent you marrying mrs herriton because i see you will both be unhappy together she is english you are italian she is accustomed to one thing you to another and pardon me if i say it she is rich and you are poor
p00128_A,00128,A,i am not marrying her because she is rich
p00129_A,00129,A,i never suggested that for a moment you are honourable i am sure but are you wise and let me remind you that we want her with us at home her little daughter will be motherless our home will be broken up if you grant my request you will earn our thanks and you will not be without a reward for your disappointment
p00130_A,00130,A,reward what reward

p00158_A,00158,A,the canons
p00159_A,00159,A,oh i forgot your horrid celibacy in england they would be the centre of everything but why shouldn t i know them would it make it easier if i called all round isn t that your foreign way but i must know some one who were the men you were talking to this afternoon but gino dear if they re low class why did you talk to them don t you care about your position
p00160_A,00160,A,you must not go out alone it is not safe if you want to walk perfetta shall accompany you
p00161_A,00161,A,they all do it myself excepted but tell me more she is english that is good very good an english wife is very good indeed and she is rich
p00162_A,00162,A,immensely rich
p00163_A,00163,A,blonde or dark
p00164_A,00164,A,blonde
p00165_A,00165,A,is it possible
p00166_A,00166,A,it pleases me very much if you remember i always desired a blonde
p00167_A,00167,A,we all desire one but you gino deserve your good fortune for you are a good son a brave man and a true friend and from the very first moment i saw you i wished you well
p00168_A,00168,A,no compliments i beg
p00169_A,00169,A,is it not true does not he deserve this wealthy blonde
p00170_A,00170,A,he does deserve her
p00171_A,00171,A,tell me i forgot to ask is she young
p00172_A,00172,A,thirty three
p00173_A,00173,A,ah well we cannot have everything
p00174_A,00174,A,but you would be surprised had she told me twenty eight i should not have disbelieved her
p00175_A,00175,A,is she simpatica
p00176_A,00176,A,sufficiently so
p00177_A,00177,A,it is a most important thing
p00178_A,00178,A,she is rich she is generous she is affable she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness
p00179_A,00179,A,it is not sufficient one does not define it thus last month a german was smuggling cigars the custom house was dark yet i refused because i did not like him the gifts of such men do not bring happiness non era simpatico he paid for every one and the fine for deception besides
p00180_A,00180,A,do you gain much beyond your pay
p00181_A,00181,A,i do not accept small sums now it is not worth the risk but the german was another matter but listen my gino for i am older than you and more full of experience the person who understands us at first sight who never irritates us who never bores to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish not only in speech but in silence that is what i mean by simpatico
p00182_A,00182,A,there are such men i know and i have heard it said of children but where will you find such a woman
p00183_A,00183,A,that is true here you are wiser than i sono poco simpatiche le donne and the time we waste over them is much
p00184_A,00184,A,one i have seen who may be so she spoke very little but she was a young lady different to most she too was english the companion of my wife here but fra filippo the brother in law took her back with him i saw them start he was very angry i regret though that i toppled him on to the bed a great tall man and when i am really amused i am often impolite
p00185_A,00185,A,you will never see him again and by now the scene will have passed from his mind
p00186_A,00186,A,it sometimes happens that such things are recollected longest i shall never see him again of course but it is no benefit to me that he should wish me ill and even if he has forgotten i am still sorry that i toppled him on to the bed i want to consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs my wife wishes to take solitary walks but i have forbidden her
p00187_A,00187,A,naturally
p00188_A,00188,A,she does not yet understand she asked me to accompany her sometimes to walk without object you know she would like me to be with her all day
p00189_A,00189,A,i see i see she needs employment is she a catholic
p00190_A,00190,A,no
p00191_A,00191,A,that is a pity she must be persuaded it will be a great solace to her when she is alone
p00192_A,00192,A,i am a catholic but of course i never go to church
p00193_A,00193,A,of course not still you might take her at first that is what my brother has done with his wife at bologna and he has joined the free thinkers he took her once or twice himself and now she has acquired the habit and continues to go without him
p00194_A,00194,A,most excellent advice and i thank you for it but she wishes to give tea parties men and women together whom she has never seen
p00195_A,00195,A,oh the english they are always thinking of tea they carry it by the kilogramme in their trunks and they are so clumsy that they always pack it at the top but it is absurd
p00196_A,00196,A,what am i to do about it
p00197_A,00197,A,do nothing or ask me
p00198_A,00198,A,come she will be quite pleased
p00199_A,00199,A,of course i was only joking
p00200_A,00200,A,i know but she wants me to take my friends come now waiter
p00201_A,00201,A,if i do come and take tea with you this bill must be my affair
p00202_A,00202,A,do you like music
p00203_A,00203,A,passionately i have not studied scientific music but the music of the heart yes
p00204_A,00204,A,i think you are quite right i shall not bring people to the house any more i do not see why an english wife should be treated differently this is italy
p00205_A,00205,A,i always do it in england
p00206_A,00206,A,this is italy
p00207_A,00207,A,yes but i m older than you and i ll settle
p00208_A,00208,A,i am your husband
p00209_A,00209,A,none of his clothes seemed to fit too big in one place too small in another what has happened he is ill ill
p00210_A,00210,A,what did you say to him
p00211_A,00211,A,it was not i
p00212_A,00212,A,you laugh
p00213_A,00213,A,ah who could help it i who thought you knew and saw nothing i am tricked i am conquered i give in let us talk of it no more
p00214_A,00214,A,gently gently
p00215_A,00215,A,it s nothing
p00216_A,00216,A,my love my dearest lilia be calm i have never loved any one but you i have prayed all night for a boy
p00217_A,00217,A,you are a boy yourself gino
p00218_A,00218,A,are we to go into mourning do you think
p00219_A,00219,A,after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma
p00220_A,00220,A,of course we must tell irma
p00221_A,00221,A,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage
p00222_A,00222,A,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now
p00223_A,00223,A,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her
p00224_A,00224,A,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby
p00225_A,00225,A,mrs theobald must be told but she doesn t count she is breaking up very quickly she doesn t even see mr kingcroft now he thank goodness i hear has at last consoled himself with someone else
p00226_A,00226,A,the child must know some time
p00227_A,00227,A,the later the better every moment she is developing
p00228_A,00228,A,i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it
p00229_A,00229,A,on irma why
p00230_A,00230,A,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them
p00231_A,00231,A,there s no need to twist the thing round to that
p00232_A,00232,A,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours
p00233_A,00233,A,it will make a difference in the money surely
p00234_A,00234,A,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians
p00235_A,00235,A,good does the italian get anything
p00236_A,00236,A,he will get all hers but you know what that is
p00237_A,00237,A,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott
p00238_A,00238,A,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline
p00239_A,00239,A,she was so mixed up in the affair
p00240_A,00240,A,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them
p00241_A,00241,A,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off
p00242_A,00242,A,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men
p00243_A,00243,A,that is quite true
p00244_A,00244,A,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed
p00245_A,00245,A,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean
p00246_A,00246,A,it is all so strange as well as so tragic and what i did was as strange as anything
p00247_A,00247,A,never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives
p00248_A,00248,A,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame
p00249_A,00249,A,indeed i never think about it now
p00250_A,00250,A,the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business
p00251_A,00251,A,yes we counted on you
p00252_A,00252,A,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy
p00253_A,00253,A,really really you knew lilia all your life apart from everything else as if she could choose what could make her happy
p00254_A,00254,A,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude
p00255_A,00255,A,let us rather say unhappily expressed
p00256_A,00256,A,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all
p00257_A,00257,A,and the telegram
p00258_A,00258,A,ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you
p00259_A,00259,A,did you really mean to stop
p00260_A,00260,A,for a time at all events
p00261_A,00261,A,would that have suited a newly married pair
p00262_A,00262,A,it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him
p00263_A,00263,A,i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation
p00264_A,00264,A,well i have explained
p00265_A,00265,A,but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation
p00266_A,00266,A,an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics
p00267_A,00267,A,oh never mind
p00268_A,00268,A,i hated sawston you see
p00269_A,00269,A,so did and do i that s splendid go on
p00270_A,00270,A,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness
p00271_A,00271,A,petty selfishness
p00272_A,00272,A,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano
p00273_A,00273,A,why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent
p00274_A,00274,A,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now
p00275_A,00275,A,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position
p00276_A,00276,A,we were mad drunk with rebellion we had no common sense as soon as you came you saw and foresaw everything
p00277_A,00277,A,oh i don t think that
p00278_A,00278,A,i hope you see why i have troubled you with this long story women i heard you say the other day are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad all through me you see mr herriton it makes me specially unhappy it s the only time i ve ever gone into what my father calls real life and look what i ve made of it all that winter i seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and i don t know what and when the spring came i wanted to fight against the things i hated mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society i actually hated society for a day or two at monteriano i didn t see that all these things are invincible and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces thank you for listening to so much nonsense
p00279_A,00279,A,oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you
p00280_A,00280,A,i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live
p00281_A,00281,A,how dare you you wicked girl give it here
p00282_A,00282,A,come with me dear and i will tell you now it is time for you to know
p00283_A,00283,A,aunt harriet uncle phil grandmamma what do you suppose my little brother is doing now has he begun to play do italian babies talk sooner than us or would he be an english baby born abroad oh i do long to see him and be the first to teach him the ten commandments and the catechism
p00284_A,00284,A,really irma is getting too tiresome she forgot poor lilia soon enough
p00285_A,00285,A,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks
p00286_A,00286,A,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers
p00287_A,00287,A,what did you say
p00288_A,00288,A,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it
p00289_A,00289,A,and what happened this morning
p00290_A,00290,A,she asked if she could pray for her new father for the italian
p00291_A,00291,A,did you let her
p00292_A,00292,A,i got up without saying anything
p00293_A,00293,A,you must have felt just as you did when i wanted to pray for the devil
p00294_A,00294,A,he is the devil
p00295_A,00295,A,no harriet he is too vulgar
p00296_A,00296,A,i will thank you not to scoff against religion think of that poor baby irma is right to pray for him what an entrance into life for an english child
p00297_A,00297,A,my dear sister i can reassure you firstly the beastly baby is italian secondly it was promptly christened at santa deodata s and a powerful combination of saints watch over
p00298_A,00298,A,i cannot think what his motive is in sending them
p00299_A,00299,A,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up
p00300_A,00300,A,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her
p00301_A,00301,A,hopeful indeed
p00302_A,00302,A,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one
p00303_A,00303,A,she might do it too
p00304_A,00304,A,i told her not to but we must watch her carefully without of course appearing to be suspicious
p00305_A,00305,A,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment
p00306_A,00306,A,i dare say you have heard
p00307_A,00307,A,yes i have i came to ask you have any steps been taken
p00308_A,00308,A,about the baby
p00309_A,00309,A,yes
p00310_A,00310,A,as far as i know no steps mrs theobald may have decided on something but i have not heard of it
p00311_A,00311,A,i was meaning had you decided on anything
p00312_A,00312,A,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p00313_A,00313,A,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald
p00314_A,00314,A,but does not mrs theobald always take any initiative from you
p00315_A,00315,A,i sometimes have given her advice in the past i should not presume to do so now
p00316_A,00316,A,then is nothing to be done for the child at all
p00317_A,00317,A,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p00318_A,00318,A,the child came into the world through my negligence it is natural i should take an interest in it
p00319_A,00319,A,my dear caroline you must not brood over the thing let bygones be bygones the child should worry you even less than it worries us we never even mention it it belongs to another world
p00320_A,00320,A,of course if mrs theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable i must say i don t see any such i shall ask if i may join her in it for irma s sake and share in any possible expenses please would you let me know if she decides on anything i should like to join as well
p00321_A,00321,A,my dear how you throw about your money we would never allow it
p00322_A,00322,A,and if she decides on nothing please also let me know let me know in any case
p00323_A,00323,A,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it
p00324_A,00324,A,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities
p00325_A,00325,A,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to
p00326_A,00326,A,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain
p00327_A,00327,A,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott
p00328_A,00328,A,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it
p00329_A,00329,A,you talk like harriet
p00330_A,00330,A,what do you think of it it would not do to let him know that we are anxious for it
p00331_A,00331,A,certainly he will never suppose that
p00332_A,00332,A,but what effect will the letter have on him
p00333_A,00333,A,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father
p00334_A,00334,A,dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out
p00335_A,00335,A,very fine of mrs herriton very fine indeed i m afraid it will mean a lot of expense she will get nothing out of italy without paying
p00336_A,00336,A,there are sure to be incidental expenses do you suppose we shall have difficulty with the man
p00337_A,00337,A,it depends
p00338_A,00338,A,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent
p00339_A,00339,A,i don t go by what i saw of him but by what i know of him
p00340_A,00340,A,well what do you conclude from that
p00341_A,00341,A,that he is a thoroughly wicked man
p00342_A,00342,A,yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children look at rodrigo borgia for example
p00343_A,00343,A,i have also seen examples of that in my district
p00344_A,00344,A,she fences well
p00345_A,00345,A,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed
p00346_A,00346,A,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano
p00347_A,00347,A,isn t it disheartening
p00348_A,00348,A,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price
p00349_A,00349,A,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go
p00350_A,00350,A,go where do sit down what s happened
p00351_A,00351,A,she won t accept won t accept the letter as final you must go to monteriano
p00352_A,00352,A,i won t i ve been and i ve failed i ll never see the place again i hate italy
p00353_A,00353,A,if you don t go she will
p00354_A,00354,A,abbott
p00355_A,00355,A,yes going alone would start this evening i offered to write she said it was too late too late the child if you please irma s brother to live with her to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates to go to school like a gentleman she paying oh you re a man it doesn t matter for you you can laugh but i know what people say and that woman goes to italy this evening
p00356_A,00356,A,then let her go let her mess with italy by herself she ll come to grief somehow italy s too dangerous too
p00357_A,00357,A,stop that nonsense philip i will not be disgraced by her i will have the child pay all we ve got for it i will have it
p00358_A,00358,A,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world
p00359_A,00359,A,it upsets one s plans terribly but obviously it is my duty
p00360_A,00360,A,did mother explain it all to you
p00361_A,00361,A,yes indeed mother has written me a really beautiful letter she describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings how she has tried by letter and it is no good nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back then she says there is nothing like personal influence you and philip will succeed where i have failed she says too that caroline abbott has been wonderful caroline feels it as keenly almost as us that is because she knows the man oh he must be loathsome goodness me i ve forgotten to pack the ammonia it has been a terrible lesson for caroline but i fancy it is her turning point i can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come
p00362_A,00362,A,absurd nonsense they talk about the heat supposing we were here for pleasure what could be more pleasurable than this
p00363_A,00363,A,did you hear though they are remarking on the cold i should never have thought it cold what a religion foreigners are a filthy nation i don t care if there are tunnels open the windows
p00364_A,00364,A,singles or returns
p00365_A,00365,A,a single for me i shall never get back alive
p00366_A,00366,A,sweet creature how helpful you will be when we come to signor carella
p00367_A,00367,A,do you suppose do you suppose i am going to enter that man s house
p00368_A,00368,A,then what have you come for pray for ornament
p00369_A,00369,A,to see that you do your duty
p00370_A,00370,A,oh thanks
p00371_A,00371,A,so mother told me for goodness sake get the tickets here comes that hot woman again she has the impudence to bow
p00372_A,00372,A,mother told you did she
p00373_A,00373,A,but do people live inside
p00374_A,00374,A,no
p00375_A,00375,A,what do they do there
p00376_A,00376,A,there is a caffe a prison a theatre a church walls a view
p00377_A,00377,A,not for me thank you
p00378_A,00378,A,nobody asked you miss you see now lilia was asked by such a nice young gentleman with curls all over his forehead and teeth just as white as father makes them but harriet do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place nothing at all
p00379_A,00379,A,nothing at all it s frightful
p00380_A,00380,A,i know it is but it s old awfully old
p00381_A,00381,A,beauty is the only test at least so you told me when i sketched old buildings for the sake i suppose of making yourself unpleasant
p00382_A,00382,A,oh i m perfectly right but at the same time i don t know so many things have happened here people have lived so hard and so splendidly i can t explain
p00383_A,00383,A,i shouldn t think you could it doesn t seem the best moment to begin your italy mania i thought you were cured of it by now instead will you kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive i do beg you will not be taken unawares this time
p00384_A,00384,A,first harriet i shall settle you at the stella d italia in the comfort that befits your sex and disposition then i shall make myself some tea after tea i shall take a book into santa deodata s and read there it is always fresh and cool
p00385_A,00385,A,i m not clever philip i don t go in for it as you know but i know what s rude and i know what s wrong
p00386_A,00386,A,meaning
p00387_A,00387,A,you what s the good of cleverness if a man s murdered a woman
p00388_A,00388,A,harriet i am hot to whom do you refer

p00392_A,00392,A,things which one must mention if one s to talk at all and things which one must keep in their proper place because he was unfaithful to his wife it doesn t follow that in every way he s absolutely vile
p00393_A,00393,A,it s the supreme test the man who is unchivalrous to a woman
p00394_A,00394,A,oh stow it take it to the back kitchen it s no more a supreme test than anything else the italians never were chivalrous from the first if you condemn him for that you ll condemn the whole lot

p00421_A,00421,A,out
p00422_A,00422,A,when will he be back i shall have to leave a message
p00423_A,00423,A,beautiful as an angel but who am i addressing
p00424_A,00424,A,thank you here is my card has a young lady happened to call here lately a young english lady a young lady pale large tall a young lady
p00425_A,00425,A,perfetta is deaf when she chooses
p00426_A,00426,A,i was going to make myself some tea
p00427_A,00427,A,i should be grateful you see harriet knows nothing
p00428_A,00428,A,no more do i he was out
p00429_A,00429,A,but what s that to do with it
p00430_A,00430,A,he was out you find me as ignorant as you have left harriet
p00431_A,00431,A,what do you mean please please mr herriton don t be mysterious there isn t the time any moment harriet may be down and we shan t have decided how to behave to her sawston was different we had to keep up appearances but here we must speak out and i think i can trust you to do it otherwise we ll never start clear
p00432_A,00432,A,pray let us start clear permit me to begin by asking you a question in which capacity have you come to monteriano spy or traitor
p00433_A,00433,A,spy spy your mother has behaved dishonourably all through she never wanted the child no harm in that but she is too proud to let it come to me she has done all she could to wreck things she did not tell you everything she has told harriet nothing at all she has lied or acted lies everywhere i cannot trust your mother so i have come here alone all across europe no one knows it my father thinks i am in normandy to spy on mrs herriton don t let s argue if you are here to get the child i will help you if you are here to fail i shall get it instead of you
p00434_A,00434,A,it is hopeless to expect you to believe me but i can assert that we are here to get the child even if it costs us all we ve got my mother has fixed no money limit whatever i am here to carry out her instructions i think that you will approve of them as you have practically dictated them i do not approve of them they are absurd harriet also carries out your instructions she however approves of them and does not know that they proceed from you i think miss abbott you had better take entire charge of the rescue party i have asked for an interview with signor carella tomorrow morning do you acquiesce might i ask for details of your interview with him they might be helpful to me
p00435_A,00435,A,my interview how do you know of it
p00436_A,00436,A,from perfetta if it interests you
p00437_A,00437,A,who ever is perfetta
p00438_A,00438,A,the woman who must have let you in
p00439_A,00439,A,in where
p00440_A,00440,A,into signor carella s house
p00441_A,00441,A,mr herriton how could you believe her do you suppose that i would have entered that man s house knowing about him all that i do i think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady i hear you wanted harriet to go very properly she refused eighteen months ago i might have done such a thing but i trust i have learnt how to behave by now
p00442_A,00442,A,i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then
p00443_A,00443,A,not an interview an accident i am very sorry i meant you to have the chance of seeing him first though it is your fault you are a day late you were due here yesterday so i came yesterday and not finding you went up to the rocca you know that kitchen garden where they let you in and there is a ladder up to a broken tower where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills
p00444_A,00444,A,yes yes i know the rocca i told you of it
p00445_A,00445,A,so i went up in the evening for the sunset i had nothing to do he was in the garden it belongs to a friend of his
p00446_A,00446,A,and you talked
p00447_A,00447,A,it was very awkward for me but i had to talk he seemed to make me you see he thought i was here as a tourist he thinks so still he intended to be civil and i judged it better to be civil also
p00448_A,00448,A,and of what did you talk
p00449_A,00449,A,the weather there will be rain he says by tomorrow evening the other towns england myself about you a little and he actually mentioned lilia he was perfectly disgusting he pretended he loved her he offered to show me her grave the grave of the woman he has murdered
p00450_A,00450,A,my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower
p00451_A,00451,A,you may be right when i tried to pave the way so to speak to hint that he had not behaved as he ought well it was no good at all he couldn t or wouldn t understand
p00452_A,00452,A,harriet would say he has no sense of sin
p00453_A,00453,A,harriet may be right i am afraid
p00454_A,00454,A,if so perhaps he isn t sinful
p00455_A,00455,A,i know what he has done what he says and what he thinks is of very little importance
p00456_A,00456,A,i should like to hear though what he said about me is he preparing a warm reception
p00457_A,00457,A,oh no not that i never told him that you and harriet were coming you could have taken him by surprise if you liked he only asked for you and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago
p00458_A,00458,A,what a memory the fellow has for little things
p00459_A,00459,A,you did not think it a little thing at the time you told me he had assaulted you
p00460_A,00460,A,i lost my temper did he really what exactly did he say
p00461_A,00461,A,he said he was sorry pleasantly as italians do say such things but he never mentioned the baby once
p00462_A,00462,A,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset
p00463_A,00463,A,and he never mentioned the baby once
p00464_A,00464,A,the view from the rocca wasn t it fine
p00465_A,00465,A,what isn t fine here i wish i was harriet
p00466_A,00466,A,because harriet
p00467_A,00467,A,mr herriton come here look at this
p00468_A,00468,A,it reaches up to heaven and down to the other place is it to be a symbol of the town
p00469_A,00469,A,surely that isn t an opera bill
p00470_A,00470,A,lucia di lammermoor by the master donizetti unique representation this evening
p00471_A,00471,A,but is there an opera right up here
p00472_A,00472,A,why yes these people know how to live they would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all that is why they have got to have so much that is good however bad the performance is tonight it will be alive italians don t love music silently like the beastly germans the audience takes its share sometimes more
p00473_A,00473,A,can t we go
p00474_A,00474,A,you see him tomorrow at ten philip well don t forget the blank cheque say an hour for the business no italians are so slow say two twelve o clock lunch well then it s no good going till the evening train i can manage the baby as far as florence
p00475_A,00475,A,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby
p00476_A,00476,A,three hours then or four or make him learn english ways at florence we get a nurse
p00477_A,00477,A,but harriet what if at first he was to refuse
p00478_A,00478,A,i don t know the meaning of the word i ve told the landlady that philip and i only want our rooms one night and we shall keep to it
p00479_A,00479,A,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man
p00480_A,00480,A,he s insolent to ladies we know but my brother can be trusted to bring him to his senses that woman philip whom you saw will carry the baby to the hotel of course you must tip her for it and try if you can to get poor lilia s silver bangles they were nice quiet things and will do for irma and there is an inlaid box i lent her lent not gave to keep her handkerchiefs in it s of no real value but this is our only chance don t ask for it but if you see it lying about just say
p00481_A,00481,A,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre
p00482_A,00482,A,theatres here and at such a moment
p00483_A,00483,A,we should hardly enjoy it with the great interview impending
p00484_A,00484,A,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous
p00485_A,00485,A,mother wouldn t like it it would be most unsuitable almost irreverent besides all that foreign theatres are notorious don t you remember those letters in the church family newspaper
p00486_A,00486,A,but this is an opera lucia di lammermoor sir walter scott classical you know
p00487_A,00487,A,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence
p00488_A,00488,A,good miss abbott you are coming too
p00489_A,00489,A,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats
p00490_A,00490,A,good gracious me i should never have thought of that as likely as not we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people one keeps on forgetting this is italy
p00491_A,00491,A,unfortunately i have no evening dress and if the seats
p00492_A,00492,A,oh that ll be all right we ll go as we are and buy the best we can get monteriano is not formal we do all right
p00493_A,00493,A,yes i know but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones we had no need to come to italy like guys
p00494_A,00494,A,don t you like it at all
p00495_A,00495,A,most awfully
p00496_A,00496,A,shut it
p00497_A,00497,A,we must make a stand from the beginning they re talking
p00498_A,00498,A,it is tiresome but perhaps it isn t for us to interfere
p00499_A,00499,A,ridiculous babies
p00500_A,00500,A,why it is the famous hot lady of the apennines the one who had never never before
p00501_A,00501,A,call this classical it s not even respectable philip take me out at once
p00502_A,00502,A,why have you not written why do you take me by surprise
p00503_A,00503,A,gino s friends are ours
p00504_A,00504,A,friends a relative a brother fra filippo who has come all the way from england and never written
p00505_A,00505,A,come in to us
p00506_A,00506,A,thank you ladies there is not time at ten o clock then i want to speak to you alone at ten
p00507_A,00507,A,that was he wasn t it
p00508_A,00508,A,yes rather
p00509_A,00509,A,i suppose you didn t settle anything
p00510_A,00510,A,why no how could i the fact is well i got taken by surprise but after all what does it matter there s no earthly reason why we shouldn t do the business pleasantly he s a perfectly charming person and so are his friends i m his friend now his long lost brother what s the harm i tell you miss abbott it s one thing for england and another for italy there we plan and get on high moral horses here we find what asses we are for things go off quite easily all by themselves my hat what a night did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before well as i was saying it s absurd to worry he s not a porky father he wants that baby as little as i do he s been ragging my dear mother just as he ragged me eighteen months ago and i ve forgiven him oh but he has a sense of humour
p00511_A,00511,A,scusi tanto
p00512_A,00512,A,what is it what has frightened you
p00513_A,00513,A,business
p00514_A,00514,A,business with me
p00515_A,00515,A,most important business
p00516_A,00516,A,before business you must get well this is the best wine
p00517_A,00517,A,perhaps you are engaged and as i am not very well
p00518_A,00518,A,you are not well enough to go back and i am not engaged ah now i understand now i see what frightened you but why did you never speak
p00519_A,00519,A,what a fine child signor carella and how nice of you to talk to it though i see that the ungrateful little fellow is asleep seven months no eight of course eight still he is a remarkably fine child for his age
p00520_A,00520,A,you must not stand let us sit on the loggia where it is cool i am afraid the room is very untidy
p00521_A,00521,A,mr herriton called yesterday but you were out
p00522_A,00522,A,but guess e manca questo
p00523_A,00523,A,this house is a large house
p00524_A,00524,A,exactly and when my poor wife died when my poor wife died i thought of having my relatives to live here my father wished to give up his practice at empoli my mother and sisters and two aunts were also willing but it was impossible they have their ways of doing things and when i was younger i was content with them but now i am a man i have my own ways do you understand
p00525_A,00525,A,yes i do it is a large house
p00526_A,00526,A,immense and the taxes but it will be better when ah but you have never guessed why i went to poggibonsi why it was that i was out when he called
p00527_A,00527,A,i cannot guess signor carella i am here on business
p00528_A,00528,A,but try
p00529_A,00529,A,i cannot i hardly know you
p00530_A,00530,A,but we are old friends and your approval will be grateful to me you gave it me once before will you give it now
p00531_A,00531,A,i have not come as a friend this time i am not likely signor carella to approve of anything you do
p00532_A,00532,A,oh signorina surely you approve of marriage
p00533_A,00533,A,where there is love
p00534_A,00534,A,where there is love
p00535_A,00535,A,do i understand that you are proposing to marry again i forbid you then i forbid you
p00536_A,00536,A,but why
p00537_A,00537,A,you have ruined one woman i forbid you to ruin another it is not a year since lilia died you pretended to me the other day that you loved her it is a lie you wanted her money has this woman money too
p00538_A,00538,A,why yes a little
p00539_A,00539,A,and i suppose you will say that you love her
p00540_A,00540,A,i shall not say it it will be untrue now my poor wife so you do not advise me but why should it be a failure
p00541_A,00541,A,how can it succeed where there is no love
p00542_A,00542,A,but she does love me i forgot to tell you that
p00543_A,00543,A,indeed
p00544_A,00544,A,passionately
p00545_A,00545,A,then god help her
p00546_A,00546,A,whatever i say displeases you signorina god help you for you are most unfair you say that i ill treated my dear wife it is not so i have never ill treated any one you complain that there is no love in this marriage i prove that there is and you become still more angry what do you want do you suppose she will not be contented glad enough she is to get me and she will do her duty well
p00547_A,00547,A,her duty
p00548_A,00548,A,why of course she knows why i am marrying her
p00549_A,00549,A,to succeed where lilia failed to be your housekeeper your slave you
p00550_A,00550,A,to look after the baby certainly
p00551_A,00551,A,the baby
p00552_A,00552,A,it is an english marriage i do not care about the money i am having her for my son did you not understand that
p00553_A,00553,A,i know ah in a foreign language and how perfectly you speak italian one is certain to make slips you meant that we could not always be together yet he and i you are right what is to be done i cannot afford a nurse and perfetta is too rough when he was ill i dare not let her touch him when he has to be washed which happens now and then who does it i i feed him or settle what he shall have i sleep with him and comfort him when he is unhappy in the night no one talks no one may sing to him but i do not be unfair this time i like to do these things but nevertheless his voice became pathetic they take up a great deal of time and are not all suitable for a young man
p00554_A,00554,A,not at all suitable
p00555_A,00555,A,a little more wine
p00556_A,00556,A,oh no thank you but marriage signor carella is a very serious step could you not manage more simply your relative for example
p00557_A,00557,A,empoli i would as soon have him in england
p00558_A,00558,A,england then he has a grandmother there you know mrs theobald
p00559_A,00559,A,he has a grandmother here no he is troublesome but i must have him with me i will not even have my father and mother too for they would separate us
p00560_A,00560,A,how
p00561_A,00561,A,oh take care
p00562_A,00562,A,he is not much longer than my boot is he can you believe that in time his own boots will be as large and that he also
p00563_A,00563,A,but ought you to treat him like that
p00564_A,00564,A,father son this woman will do exactly what i tell her she is fond of children she is clean she has a pleasant voice she is not beautiful i cannot pretend that to you for a moment but she is what i require
p00565_A,00565,A,oh do take care you are squeezing it
p00566_A,00566,A,it is nothing if he cries silently then you may be frightened he thinks i am going to wash him and he is quite right
p00567_A,00567,A,wash him you here
p00568_A,00568,A,i had gone to the farmacia and was sitting there comfortably when suddenly i remembered that perfetta had heated water an hour ago over there look covered with a cushion i came away at once for really he must be washed you must excuse me i can put it off no longer
p00569_A,00569,A,i have wasted your time
p00570_A,00570,A,but why are you going excuse me if i wash him while we talk
p00571_A,00571,A,i have nothing more to say
p00572_A,00572,A,oh but stop a moment you have not seen him yet
p00573_A,00573,A,i have seen as much as i want thank you
p00574_A,00574,A,take him
p00575_A,00575,A,i must go at once
p00576_A,00576,A,who would have believed his mother was blonde for he is brown all over brown every inch of him ah but how beautiful he is and he is mine mine for ever even if he hates me he will be mine he cannot help it he is made out of me i am his father
p00577_A,00577,A,may i help you to wash him
p00578_A,00578,A,it is very kind of you especially in your beautiful dress he is nearly clean already why i take the whole morning there is so much more of a baby than one expects and perfetta washes him just as she washes clothes then he screams for hours my wife is to have a light hand ah how he kicks has he splashed you i am very sorry
p00579_A,00579,A,i am ready for a soft towel now
p00580_A,00580,A,certainly certainly
p00581_A,00581,A,signorina do stop a little after all your kindness

p00589_A,00589,A,then why has she come here answer me that bursting in on me crying and looking a disgusting sight and says she has been to see the italian couldn t even talk properly pretended she had changed her opinions what are her opinions to us i was very calm i said miss abbott i think there is a little misapprehension in this matter my mother mrs herriton oh goodness my head of course you ve failed don t trouble to answer i know you ve failed where s the baby pray of course you haven t got it dear sweet caroline won t let you oh yes and we re to go away at once and trouble the father no more those are her commands commands commands
p00590_A,00590,A,i ve not got the baby harriet but at the same time i haven t exactly failed i and signor carella are to have another interview this afternoon at the caffe garibaldi he is perfectly reasonable and pleasant should you be disposed to come with me you would find him quite willing to discuss things he is desperately in want of money and has no prospect of getting any i discovered that at the same time he has a certain affection for the child miss abbott has behaved extraordinarily but at the same time harriet you must listen my dear you must stop crying i have something quite important to say
p00591_A,00591,A,i shall not stop crying
p00592_A,00592,A,remember that miss abbott has done us no harm she said nothing to him about the matter he assumes that she is working with us i gathered that
p00593_A,00593,A,well she isn t
p00594_A,00594,A,yes but if you re careful she may be i interpret her behaviour thus she went to see him honestly intending to get the child away in the note she left me she says so and i don t believe she d lie
p00595_A,00595,A,i do
p00596_A,00596,A,when she got there there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism before very long if i know anything about psychology there will be a reaction she ll be swept back
p00597_A,00597,A,i don t understand your long words say plainly
p00598_A,00598,A,when she s swept back she ll be invaluable for she has made quite an impression on him he thinks her so nice with the baby you know she washed it for him
p00599_A,00599,A,disgusting
p00600_A,00600,A,if you want to carry off the baby keep your peace with miss abbott for if she chooses she can help you better than i can
p00601_A,00601,A,there can be no peace between me and her
p00602_A,00602,A,did you
p00603_A,00603,A,oh not all i wanted she went away before i had finished speaking just like those cowardly people into the church
p00604_A,00604,A,into santa deodata s
p00605_A,00605,A,yes i m sure she needs it anything more unchristian
p00606_A,00606,A,i am sure that i need it i ve nothing to tell you i have simply changed straight round if i had planned the whole thing out i could not have treated you worse i can talk it over now but please believe that i have been crying
p00607_A,00607,A,and please believe that i have not come to scold you i know what has happened
p00608_A,00608,A,what
p00609_A,00609,A,what might have happened to me he had made you believe that he loved the child
p00610_A,00610,A,oh yes he has he will never give it up
p00611_A,00611,A,at present it is still unsettled
p00612_A,00612,A,it will never be settled
p00613_A,00613,A,perhaps not well as i said i know what has happened and i am not here to scold you but i must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present harriet is furious but she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm and will do none
p00614_A,00614,A,i can do no more but i tell you plainly i have changed sides
p00615_A,00615,A,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella
p00616_A,00616,A,oh certainly i don t want to speak to him again i shan t ever see him again
p00617_A,00617,A,quite nice wasn t he
p00618_A,00618,A,quite
p00619_A,00619,A,well that s all i wanted to know i ll go and tell harriet of your promise and i think things ll quiet down now
p00620_A,00620,A,why aren t you angry with me
p00621_A,00621,A,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother
p00622_A,00622,A,you do understand wonderfully you are the only one of us who has a general view of the muddle so what are you going to do
p00623_A,00623,A,do this afternoon i have another interview
p00624_A,00624,A,it will come to nothing well
p00625_A,00625,A,then another if that fails i shall wire home for instructions i dare say we may fail altogether but we shall fail honourably
p00626_A,00626,A,that s not doing anything you would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby or if you went straight away but that to fail honourably to come out of the thing as well as you can is that all you are after
p00627_A,00627,A,why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns
p00628_A,00628,A,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all
p00629_A,00629,A,because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that
p00630_A,00630,A,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair
p00631_A,00631,A,you are wonderful
p00632_A,00632,A,oh you appreciate me i wish you didn t you appreciate us all see good in all of us and all the time you are dead dead dead look why aren t you angry you are so splendid mr herriton that i can t bear to see you wasted i can t bear she has not been good to you your mother
p00633_A,00633,A,miss abbott don t worry over me some people are born not to do things i m one of them i never did anything at school or at the bar i came out to stop lilia s marriage and it was too late i came out intending to get the baby and i shall return an honourable failure i never expect anything to happen now and so i am never disappointed you would be surprised to know what my great events are going to the theatre yesterday talking to you now i don t suppose i shall ever meet anything greater i seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it and i m sure i can t tell you whether the fate s good or evil i don t die i don t fall in love and if other people die or fall in love they always do it when i m just not there you are quite right life to me is just a spectacle which thank god and thank italy and thank you is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before
p00634_A,00634,A,i wish something would happen to you my dear friend i wish something would happen to you
p00635_A,00635,A,look here it s too hot for this we ve been talking and interviewing each other all the morning and i have another interview this afternoon i do stipulate for silence let each lady retire to her bedroom with a book
p00636_A,00636,A,i retire to pack please remind signor carella philip that the baby is to be here by half past eight this evening
p00637_A,00637,A,oh certainly harriet i shall make a point of reminding him
p00638_A,00638,A,and order a carriage to take us to the evening train
p00639_A,00639,A,and please would you order a carriage for me too
p00640_A,00640,A,you going
p00641_A,00641,A,of course why not
p00642_A,00642,A,why of course you would be going two carriages then two carriages for the evening train harriet whatever are you up to we shall never be ready
p00643_A,00643,A,order my carriage for the evening train
p00644_A,00644,A,well i suppose i shall and i shall also have my interview with signor carella but why should you mind do you suppose that i shall have the slightest influence over him
p00645_A,00645,A,no but i can t repeat all that i said in the church you ought never to see him again you ought to bundle harriet into a carriage not this evening but now and drive her straight away
p00646_A,00646,A,perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it
p00647_A,00647,A,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever
p00648_A,00648,A,well you are right this affair is being managed by the ladies
p00649_A,00649,A,ah the ladies the ladies
p00650_A,00650,A,well i have done my best i shall face my mother with a good conscience will you bear me witness that i ve done my best
p00651_A,00651,A,my poor fellow i will
p00652_A,00652,A,and that i have mia sorella poor harriet one more wrench and it will all be over for her we are leaving this evening
p00653_A,00653,A,then you will not be here this evening as you promised us all three leaving
p00654_A,00654,A,yes do now that we have quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the hill well good bye it s all over at last another scene in my pageant has shifted
p00655_A,00655,A,good bye it s been a great pleasure to see you i hope that won t shift at all events
p00656_A,00656,A,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious
p00657_A,00657,A,i suppose i do
p00658_A,00658,A,depend upon it she has gone to signor carella s to say good bye to her little nephew
p00659_A,00659,A,the poor idiot he cannot speak he takes messages for us all
p00660_A,00660,A,ugh signora padrona find out from him this note is from my sister what does it mean where did he see her
p00661_A,00661,A,it is no good he understands everything but he can explain nothing
p00662_A,00662,A,he has visions of the saints
p00663_A,00663,A,but my sister where has she gone how has she met him
p00664_A,00664,A,she has gone for a walk she has gone for a walk perhaps to wish good bye to her little nephew preferring to come back another way she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you outside the siena gate many of my guests do this
p00665_A,00665,A,go on i have paid him plenty go on what am i to do it is not like the lady to be late we shall miss the train
p00666_A,00666,A,let us drive slowly and you shall call her by name as we go
p00667_A,00667,A,harriet harriet harriet harriet why don t you answer

p00686_A,00686,A,oh the night air i suppose or perhaps the wet of the rain
p00687_A,00687,A,i say you haven t hurt it or held it the wrong way or anything it is too uncanny crying and no noise why didn t you get perfetta to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger it s a marvel he understood about the note
p00688_A,00688,A,oh he understands he tried to carry the baby
p00689_A,00689,A,but why not gino or perfetta
p00690_A,00690,A,philip don t talk must i say it again don t talk the baby wants to sleep

p00694_A,00694,A,are you
p00695_A,00695,A,because he s weak like most of us he doesn t know what he wants he doesn t grip on to life but i like that man and i m sorry for him you despise him harriet and you despise me but you do us no good by it we fools want some one to set us on our feet suppose a really decent woman had set up gino i believe caroline abbott might have done it mightn t he have been another man
p00696_A,00696,A,philip do you happen to have those matches handy we might as well look at the baby again if you have oh i don t want all that bother try again

p00702_A,00702,A,where are you

p00704_A,00704,A,so you are back how glad i am we are all waiting
p00705_A,00705,A,but your son is dead gino your son is dead dear gino your son is dead what is the good of another death what is the good of more pain go to him pick him up treat him kindly

p00710_A,00710,A,put the milk on the table it will not be wanted in the other room
p00711_A,00711,A,that milk need not be wasted take it signor carella and persuade mr herriton to drink is there any left
p00712_A,00712,A,a little

p00718_A,00718,A,it does not matter it does not matter it will never be wanted any more
p00719_A,00719,A,he will have to marry her i heard from him this morning just as we left milan he finds he has gone too far to back out it would be expensive i don t know how much he minds not as much as we suppose i think at all events there s not a word of blame in the letter i don t believe he even feels angry i never was so completely forgiven ever since you stopped him killing me it has been a vision of perfect friendship he nursed me he lied for me at the inquest and at the funeral though he was crying you would have thought it was my son who had died certainly i was the only person he had to be kind to he was so distressed not to make harriet s acquaintance and that he scarcely saw anything of you in his letter he says so again
p00720_A,00720,A,thank him please when you write and give him my kindest regards
p00721_A,00721,A,indeed i will
p00722_A,00722,A,when will you see him again
p00723_A,00723,A,i hope next spring perhaps we shall paint siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money it was one of the arguments for marrying her
p00724_A,00724,A,he has no heart he does not really mind about the child at all
p00725_A,00725,A,no you re wrong he does he is unhappy like the rest of us but he doesn t try to keep up appearances as we do he knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again
p00726_A,00726,A,he said he would never be happy again
p00727_A,00727,A,in his passion not when he was calm we english say it when we are calm when we do not really believe it any longer gino is not ashamed of inconsistency it is one of the many things i like him for
p00728_A,00728,A,yes i was wrong that is so
p00729_A,00729,A,he s much more honest with himself than i am and he is honest without an effort and without pride but you miss abbott what about you will you be in italy next spring
p00730_A,00730,A,no
p00731_A,00731,A,i m sorry when will you come back do you think
p00732_A,00732,A,i think never
p00733_A,00733,A,for whatever reason
p00734_A,00734,A,because i understand the place there is no need
p00735_A,00735,A,understand italy
p00736_A,00736,A,perfectly
p00737_A,00737,A,are your plans decided
p00738_A,00738,A,yes i can t live at sawston
p00739_A,00739,A,have you told mrs herriton
p00740_A,00740,A,i wrote from monteriano i tried to explain things but she will never understand me her view will be that the affair is settled sadly settled since the baby is dead still it s over our family circle need be vexed no more she won t even be angry with you you see you have done us no harm in the long run unless of course you talk about harriet and make a scandal so that is my plan london and work what is yours
p00741_A,00741,A,poor harriet as if i dare judge harriet or anybody
p00742_A,00742,A,is harriet going to be all right
p00743_A,00743,A,she will soon be her old self
p00744_A,00744,A,i m clear enough about harriet s future and about parts of my own but i ask again what about yours
p00745_A,00745,A,sawston and work
p00746_A,00746,A,no
p00747_A,00747,A,why not
p00748_A,00748,A,you ve seen too much you ve seen as much and done more than i have
p00749_A,00749,A,but it s so different of course i shall go to sawston you forget my father and even if he wasn t there i ve a hundred ties my district i m neglecting it shamefully my evening classes the st james
p00750_A,00750,A,silly nonsense you re too good about a thousand times better than i am you can t live in that hole you must go among people who can hope to understand you i mind for myself i want to see you often again and again
p00751_A,00751,A,of course we shall meet whenever you come down and i hope that it will mean often
p00752_A,00752,A,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough
p00753_A,00753,A,we can write at all events
p00754_A,00754,A,you will write
p00755_A,00755,A,i will indeed
p00756_A,00756,A,but i say it s not enough you can t go back to the old life if you wanted to too much has happened
p00757_A,00757,A,i know that
p00758_A,00758,A,not only pain and sorrow but wonderful things that tower in the sunlight do you remember it and all you said to me the theatre even and the next day in the church and our times with gino
p00759_A,00759,A,all the wonderful things are over that is just where it is
p00760_A,00760,A,i don t believe it at all events not for me the most wonderful things may be to come
p00761_A,00761,A,the wonderful things are over
p00762_A,00762,A,miss abbott what is the matter with you i thought i understood you and i don t all those two great first days at monteriano i read you as clearly as you read me still i saw why you had come and why you changed sides and afterwards i saw your wonderful courage and pity and now you re frank with me one moment as you used to be and the next moment you shut me up you see i owe too much to you my life and i don t know what besides i won t stand it you ve gone too far to turn mysterious i ll quote what you said to me don t be mysterious there isn t the time i ll quote something else i and my life must be where i live you can t live at sawston
p00763_A,00763,A,it is tempting it is tempting not to be mysterious i ve wanted often to tell you and then been afraid i could never tell any one else certainly no woman and i think you re the one man who might understand and not be disgusted
p00764_A,00764,A,are you lonely is it anything like that
p00765_A,00765,A,yes i m terribly lonely or i wouldn t speak i think you must know already
p00766_A,00766,A,perhaps i do perhaps i could speak instead but if you will say the word plainly you ll never be sorry i will thank you for it all my life
p00767_A,00767,A,that i love him
p00768_A,00768,A,rather i love him too when i can forget how he hurt me that evening though whenever we shake hands
p00769_A,00769,A,you ve upset me i thought i was past all this you re taking it wrongly i m in love with gino don t pass it off i mean it crudely you know what i mean so laugh at me
p00770_A,00770,A,laugh at love
p00771_A,00771,A,yes pull it to pieces tell me i m a fool or worse that he s a cad say all you said when lilia fell in love with him that s the help i want i dare tell you this because i like you and because you re without passion you look on life as a spectacle you don t enter it you only find it funny or beautiful so i can trust you to cure me mr herriton isn t it funny he s not a gentleman nor a christian nor good in any way he s never flattered me nor honoured me but because he s handsome that s been enough the son of an italian dentist with a pretty face oh mr herriton isn t it funny i love him and i m not ashamed of it i love him and i m going to sawston and if i mayn t speak about him to you sometimes i shall die
p00772_A,00772,A,perhaps it is what the books call a passing fancy
p00773_A,00773,A,if i saw him often i might remember what he is like or he might grow old but i dare not risk it so nothing can alter me now
p00774_A,00774,A,well if the fancy does pass let me know
p00775_A,00775,A,oh you shall know quick enough
p00776_A,00776,A,but before you retire to sawston are you so mighty sure
p00777_A,00777,A,what of
p00778_A,00778,A,that you and he i was going to say whatever have you got in common
p00779_A,00779,A,nothing except the times we have seen each other
p00780_A,00780,A,which which times
p00781_A,00781,A,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round
p00782_A,00782,A,but through my fault he is parted from the child he loves and because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again
p00783_A,00783,A,don t talk of faults you re my friend for ever mr herriton i think only don t be charitable and shift or take the blame get over supposing i m refined that s what puzzles you get over that i say again don t be charitable if he had asked me i might have given myself body and soul that would have been the end of my rescue party but all through he took me for a superior being a goddess i who was worshipping every inch of him and every word he spoke and that saved me
p00000_B,00000,B,remember that it is only by going off the track that you get to know the country see the little towns gubbio pienza cortona san gemignano monteriano and don t let me beg you go with that awful tourist idea that italy s only a museum of antiquities and art love and understand the italians for the people are more marvellous than the land
p00001_B,00001,B,how i wish you were coming philip

p00007_B,00007,B,handkerchiefs and collars in my inlaid box i ve lent you my inlaid box
p00008_B,00008,B,good old harry
p00009_B,00009,B,oh i am so sorry but you do look so funny oh you all look so funny waving oh pray
p00010_B,00010,B,high spirits to begin so long a journey
p00011_B,00011,B,i wish that mrs charles had gotten the footwarmer these london porters won t take heed to a country chap
p00012_B,00012,B,but you did your best and i think it simply noble of you to have brought mrs theobald all the way here on such a day as this
p00013_B,00013,B,and granny when will the old ship get to italy
p00014_B,00014,B,grandmother dear not granny and we say a boat or a steamer not a ship ships have sails and mother won t go all the way by sea you look at the map of europe and you ll see why harriet take her go with aunt harriet and she ll show you the map
p00015_B,00015,B,righto
p00016_B,00016,B,here beginneth the new life
p00017_B,00017,B,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her
p00018_B,00018,B,and alas alas a look of old mrs theobald what appalling apparition was that i did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile why ever did she come
p00019_B,00019,B,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way
p00020_B,00020,B,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells
p00021_B,00021,B,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her
p00022_B,00022,B,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public
p00023_B,00023,B,when a man is neither well bred nor well connected nor handsome nor clever nor rich even lilia may discard him in time
p00024_B,00024,B,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch
p00025_B,00025,B,my dear boy if possible she has got worse and worse it was your idea of italian travel that saved us
p00026_B,00026,B,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there
p00027_B,00027,B,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera
p00028_B,00028,B,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her
p00029_B,00029,B,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it
p00030_B,00030,B,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable
p00031_B,00031,B,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose
p00032_B,00032,B,there is santa deodata one of the most beautiful churches in italy
p00033_B,00033,B,of course i mean an english church lilia promised me that she would always be in a large town on sundays
p00034_B,00034,B,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe
p00035_B,00035,B,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching
p00036_B,00036,B,every one to his taste
p00037_B,00037,B,oh harriet is a bad lot
p00038_B,00038,B,we will save the peas to the last they are the greatest fun
p00039_B,00039,B,it s a shame mother philip laughs at everything the book club the debating society the progressive whist the bazaars people won t like it we have our reputation a house divided against itself cannot stand
p00040_B,00040,B,let philip say what he likes and he will let us do what we like it s twelve the second post s in run and see if there are any letters
p00041_B,00041,B,let s finish the peas there won t be any letters
p00042_B,00042,B,no dear please go i ll sow the peas but you shall cover them up and mind the birds don t see em
p00043_B,00043,B,actually old mrs theobald
p00044_B,00044,B,read me the letter my hands are dirty how intolerable the crested paper is
p00045_B,00045,B,i don t understand it doesn t make sense
p00046_B,00046,B,her letters never did
p00047_B,00047,B,but it must be sillier than usual look here read it mother i can t make head or tail
p00048_B,00048,B,what is the difficulty what is it that puzzles you in this letter
p00049_B,00049,B,the meaning
p00050_B,00050,B,the meaning is quite clear lilia is engaged to be married don t cry dear please me by not crying don t talk at all it s more than i could bear she is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel take the letter and read for yourself how dare she not tell me direct how dare she write first to yorkshire pray am i to hear through mrs theobald a patronizing insolent letter like this have i no claim at all bear witness dear bear witness that for this i ll never forgive her
p00051_B,00051,B,oh what is to be done what is to be done
p00052_B,00052,B,this first next a telegram for lilia no a telegram for miss caroline abbott she too has something to explain
p00053_B,00053,B,oh what is to be done
p00054_B,00054,B,if there is an office there we might get an answer this evening since philip is back at seven and the eight fifteen catches the midnight boat at dover harriet when you go with this get 100 pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank go dear at once do not talk i see irma coming back go quickly well irma dear and whose team are you in this afternoon miss edith s or miss may s
p00055_B,00055,B,your feet grow larger every day
p00056_B,00056,B,it is too bad it s ridiculous to read dear she s not trying to marry any one in the place some tourist obviously who s stopping in the hotel the place has nothing to do with it at all
p00057_B,00057,B,but what a place to go to what nice person too do you meet in a hotel
p00058_B,00058,B,nice or nasty as i have told you several times before is not the point lilia has insulted our family and she shall suffer for it and when you speak against hotels i think you forget that i met your father at chamounix you can contribute nothing dear at present and i think you had better hold your tongue i am going to the kitchen to speak about the range
p00059_B,00059,B,i will do all i can
p00060_B,00060,B,certainly please if you will be so very kind
p00061_B,00061,B,then how long has she been engaged
p00062_B,00062,B,a short time quite a short time
p00063_B,00063,B,i should like to know how long if you can remember
p00064_B,00064,B,exactly eleven days
p00065_B,00065,B,how long have you been here
p00066_B,00066,B,close on three weeks

p00068_B,00068,B,no
p00069_B,00069,B,oh who is he
p00070_B,00070,B,a native of the place
p00071_B,00071,B,i understood they met at the hotel
p00072_B,00072,B,it was a mistake of mrs theobald s
p00073_B,00073,B,i also understand that he is a member of the italian nobility may i be told his name
p00074_B,00074,B,carella
p00075_B,00075,B,carella conte or marchese or what
p00076_B,00076,B,signor
p00077_B,00077,B,perhaps i bore you with these questions if so i will stop
p00078_B,00078,B,oh no please not at all i am here my own idea to give all information which you very naturally and to see if somehow please ask anything you like
p00079_B,00079,B,then how old is he
p00080_B,00080,B,oh quite young twenty one i believe
p00081_B,00081,B,good lord
p00082_B,00082,B,one would never believe it he looks much older
p00083_B,00083,B,and is he good looking
p00084_B,00084,B,very good looking all his features are good and he is well built though i dare say english standards would find him too short
p00085_B,00085,B,may i conclude that you like him
p00086_B,00086,B,as far as i have seen him i do as far as i have seen him i do like him
p00087_B,00087,B,what is he please you haven t told me that what s his position
p00088_B,00088,B,no position at all he is kicking his heels as my father would say you see he has only just finished his military service
p00089_B,00089,B,as a private
p00090_B,00090,B,i suppose so there is general conscription he was in the bersaglieri i think isn t that the crack regiment
p00091_B,00091,B,the men in it must be short and broad they must also be able to walk six miles an hour
p00092_B,00092,B,and now like most young men he is looking out for something to do
p00093_B,00093,B,meanwhile
p00094_B,00094,B,meanwhile like most young men he lives with his people father mother two sisters and a tiny tot of a brother
p00095_B,00095,B,one more question and only one more what is his father
p00096_B,00096,B,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven
p00097_B,00097,B,yes miss abbott i know but i am anxious to hear heaven s choice you arouse my curiosity is my sister in law to marry an angel
p00098_B,00098,B,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist
p00099_B,00099,B,i cannot think what is in the air if lilia was determined to disgrace us she might have found a less repulsive way a boy of medium height with a pretty face the son of a dentist at monteriano have i put it correctly may i surmise that he has not got one penny may i also surmise that his social position is nil furthermore
p00100_B,00100,B,stop i ll tell you no more
p00101_B,00101,B,really miss abbott it is a little late for reticence you have equipped me admirably
p00102_B,00102,B,i ll tell you not another word
p00103_B,00103,B,i ve told nothing it s all for you and if it only takes a quarter of an hour you ll be lucky
p00104_B,00104,B,oh look the poor wee fish
p00105_B,00105,B,but may not the fish die they have no air
p00106_B,00106,B,fish live on water not on air
p00107_B,00107,B,well philip i am sure you are ready for by bye we shall meet at twelve o clock lunch tomorrow if we don t meet before they give us caffe later in our rooms
p00108_B,00108,B,i should like to see you now please in my room as i have come all the way on business
p00109_B,00109,B,see for yourself
p00110_B,00110,B,that he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad
p00111_B,00111,B,there are no cads in italy he is the son of a dentist why not
p00112_B,00112,B,thank you for the information i know everything as i told you before i am also aware of the social position of an italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town
p00113_B,00113,B,indeed philip you surprise me i understood you went in for equality and so on
p00114_B,00114,B,and i understood that signor carella was a member of the italian nobility
p00115_B,00115,B,well we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear mrs herriton but it is true he is a younger branch of course families ramify just as in yours there is your cousin joseph gino s father is courtesy itself and rising rapidly in his profession this very month he leaves monteriano and sets up at poggibonsi and for my own poor part i think what people are is what matters but i don t suppose you ll agree and i should like you to know that gino s uncle is a priest the same as a clergyman at home well his cousin s a lawyer at rome
p00116_B,00116,B,what kind of lawyer
p00117_B,00117,B,why a lawyer just like you are except that he has lots to do and can never get away
p00118_B,00118,B,the whole thing is like a bad dream so bad that it cannot go on if there was one redeeming feature about the man i might be uneasy as it is i can trust to time for the moment lilia he has taken you in but you will find him out soon it is not possible that you a lady accustomed to ladies and gentlemen will tolerate a man whose position is well not equal to the son of the servants dentist in coronation place i am not blaming you now but i blame the glamour of italy i have felt it myself you know and i greatly blame miss abbott
p00119_B,00119,B,caroline why blame her what s all this to do with caroline
p00120_B,00120,B,because we expected her to so i am confident and you in your heart agree that this engagement will not last think of your life at home think of irma and i ll also say think of us for you know lilia that we count you more than a relation i should feel i was losing my own sister if you did this and my mother would lose a daughter
p00121_B,00121,B,i can t break it off now
p00122_B,00122,B,poor lilia i know it may be painful but i have come to rescue you and book worm though i may be i am not frightened to stand up to a bully he s merely an insolent boy he thinks he can keep you to your word by threats he will be different when he sees he has a man to deal with
p00123_B,00123,B,for once in my life i ll thank you to leave me alone i ll thank your mother too for twelve years you ve trained me and tortured me and i ll stand it no more do you think i m a fool do you think i never felt ah when i came to your house a poor young bride how you all looked me over never a kind word and discussed me and thought i might just do and your mother corrected me and your sister snubbed me and you said funny things about me to show how clever you were and when charles died i was still to run in strings for the honour of your beastly family and i was to be cooped up at sawston and learn to keep house and all my chances spoilt of marrying again no thank you no thank you bully insolent boy who s that pray but you but thank goodness i can stand up against the world now for i ve found gino and this time i marry for love
p00124_B,00124,B,yes and i forbid you to do it you despise me perhaps and think i m feeble but you re mistaken you are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible but i will save you in order to save irma and our name there is going to be such a row in this town that you and he ll be sorry you came to it i shall shrink from nothing for my blood is up it is unwise of you to laugh i forbid you to marry carella and i shall tell him so now
p00125_B,00125,B,do
p00126_B,00126,B,please sit down signor carella mrs herriton is rather agitated but there is no reason we should not be calm might i offer you a cigarette please sit down signor carella i will be frank with you i have come to prevent you marrying mrs herriton because i see you will both be unhappy together she is english you are italian she is accustomed to one thing you to another and pardon me if i say it she is rich and you are poor
p00127_B,00127,B,i am not marrying her because she is rich

p00157_B,00157,B,the canons
p00158_B,00158,B,oh i forgot your horrid celibacy in england they would be the centre of everything but why shouldn t i know them would it make it easier if i called all round isn t that your foreign way but i must know some one who were the men you were talking to this afternoon but gino dear if they re low class why did you talk to them don t you care about your position
p00159_B,00159,B,ouf pouf how hot it is in here no air i sweat all over i expire i must cool myself or i shall never get to sleep and i though i am young am at all events a man and know what is right
p00160_B,00160,B,very well very well
p00161_B,00161,B,immensely rich
p00162_B,00162,B,blonde or dark
p00163_B,00163,B,blonde
p00164_B,00164,B,is it possible
p00165_B,00165,B,it pleases me very much if you remember i always desired a blonde
p00166_B,00166,B,we all desire one but you gino deserve your good fortune for you are a good son a brave man and a true friend and from the very first moment i saw you i wished you well
p00167_B,00167,B,no compliments i beg
p00168_B,00168,B,is it not true does not he deserve this wealthy blonde
p00169_B,00169,B,he does deserve her
p00170_B,00170,B,tell me i forgot to ask is she young
p00171_B,00171,B,thirty three
p00172_B,00172,B,ah well we cannot have everything
p00173_B,00173,B,but you would be surprised had she told me twenty eight i should not have disbelieved her
p00174_B,00174,B,is she simpatica
p00175_B,00175,B,sufficiently so
p00176_B,00176,B,it is a most important thing
p00177_B,00177,B,she is rich she is generous she is affable she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness
p00178_B,00178,B,it is not sufficient one does not define it thus last month a german was smuggling cigars the custom house was dark yet i refused because i did not like him the gifts of such men do not bring happiness non era simpatico he paid for every one and the fine for deception besides
p00179_B,00179,B,do you gain much beyond your pay
p00180_B,00180,B,i do not accept small sums now it is not worth the risk but the german was another matter but listen my gino for i am older than you and more full of experience the person who understands us at first sight who never irritates us who never bores to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish not only in speech but in silence that is what i mean by simpatico
p00181_B,00181,B,there are such men i know and i have heard it said of children but where will you find such a woman
p00182_B,00182,B,that is true here you are wiser than i sono poco simpatiche le donne and the time we waste over them is much
p00183_B,00183,B,one i have seen who may be so she spoke very little but she was a young lady different to most she too was english the companion of my wife here but fra filippo the brother in law took her back with him i saw them start he was very angry i regret though that i toppled him on to the bed a great tall man and when i am really amused i am often impolite
p00184_B,00184,B,you will never see him again and by now the scene will have passed from his mind
p00185_B,00185,B,it sometimes happens that such things are recollected longest i shall never see him again of course but it is no benefit to me that he should wish me ill and even if he has forgotten i am still sorry that i toppled him on to the bed i want to consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs my wife wishes to take solitary walks but i have forbidden her
p00186_B,00186,B,naturally
p00187_B,00187,B,she does not yet understand she asked me to accompany her sometimes to walk without object you know she would like me to be with her all day
p00188_B,00188,B,i see i see she needs employment is she a catholic
p00189_B,00189,B,no
p00190_B,00190,B,that is a pity she must be persuaded it will be a great solace to her when she is alone
p00191_B,00191,B,i am a catholic but of course i never go to church
p00192_B,00192,B,of course not still you might take her at first that is what my brother has done with his wife at bologna and he has joined the free thinkers he took her once or twice himself and now she has acquired the habit and continues to go without him
p00193_B,00193,B,most excellent advice and i thank you for it but she wishes to give tea parties men and women together whom she has never seen
p00194_B,00194,B,oh the english they are always thinking of tea they carry it by the kilogramme in their trunks and they are so clumsy that they always pack it at the top but it is absurd
p00195_B,00195,B,what am i to do about it
p00196_B,00196,B,do nothing or ask me
p00197_B,00197,B,come she will be quite pleased
p00198_B,00198,B,of course i was only joking
p00199_B,00199,B,i know but she wants me to take my friends come now waiter
p00200_B,00200,B,if i do come and take tea with you this bill must be my affair
p00201_B,00201,B,certainly not you are in my country
p00202_B,00202,B,passionately i have not studied scientific music but the music of the heart yes
p00203_B,00203,B,i think you are quite right i shall not bring people to the house any more i do not see why an english wife should be treated differently this is italy
p00204_B,00204,B,you are very wise very wise indeed the more precious a possession the more carefully it should be guarded
p00205_B,00205,B,this is italy
p00206_B,00206,B,yes but i m older than you and i ll settle
p00207_B,00207,B,i am your husband
p00208_B,00208,B,and i ve got the money and you d better mend your manners for you d find it awkward if i stopped drawing cheques
p00209_B,00209,B,what did you say to him
p00210_B,00210,B,hardly anything
p00211_B,00211,B,perhaps if i have a child he will be different i know he wants a son
p00212_B,00212,B,ah who could help it i who thought you knew and saw nothing i am tricked i am conquered i give in let us talk of it no more
p00213_B,00213,B,what courage you have and what good fortune he is angry no longer he has forgiven you
p00214_B,00214,B,it s nothing
p00215_B,00215,B,my love my dearest lilia be calm i have never loved any one but you i have prayed all night for a boy
p00216_B,00216,B,you are a boy yourself gino
p00217_B,00217,B,then we shall be brothers
p00218_B,00218,B,after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma
p00219_B,00219,B,of course we must tell irma
p00220_B,00220,B,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage
p00221_B,00221,B,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now
p00222_B,00222,B,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her
p00223_B,00223,B,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby
p00224_B,00224,B,mrs theobald must be told but she doesn t count she is breaking up very quickly she doesn t even see mr kingcroft now he thank goodness i hear has at last consoled himself with someone else
p00225_B,00225,B,the child must know some time
p00226_B,00226,B,the later the better every moment she is developing
p00227_B,00227,B,i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it
p00228_B,00228,B,on irma why
p00229_B,00229,B,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them
p00230_B,00230,B,there s no need to twist the thing round to that
p00231_B,00231,B,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours
p00232_B,00232,B,it will make a difference in the money surely
p00233_B,00233,B,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians
p00234_B,00234,B,good does the italian get anything
p00235_B,00235,B,he will get all hers but you know what that is
p00236_B,00236,B,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott
p00237_B,00237,B,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline
p00238_B,00238,B,she was so mixed up in the affair
p00239_B,00239,B,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them
p00240_B,00240,B,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off
p00241_B,00241,B,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men
p00242_B,00242,B,that is quite true
p00243_B,00243,B,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed
p00244_B,00244,B,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean
p00245_B,00245,B,she did but she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy she saw that i was reticent and she did not press me you see philip i can say to you what i could not say before harriet her ideas are so crude really we do not want it known in sawston that there is a baby all peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it
p00246_B,00246,B,never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives
p00247_B,00247,B,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame
p00248_B,00248,B,indeed i never think about it now
p00249_B,00249,B,the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business
p00250_B,00250,B,yes we counted on you
p00251_B,00251,B,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy
p00252_B,00252,B,really really you knew lilia all your life apart from everything else as if she could choose what could make her happy
p00253_B,00253,B,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude
p00254_B,00254,B,let us rather say unhappily expressed
p00255_B,00255,B,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all
p00256_B,00256,B,and the telegram
p00257_B,00257,B,ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you
p00258_B,00258,B,did you really mean to stop
p00259_B,00259,B,for a time at all events
p00260_B,00260,B,would that have suited a newly married pair
p00261_B,00261,B,it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him
p00262_B,00262,B,i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation
p00263_B,00263,B,well i have explained
p00264_B,00264,B,but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation
p00265_B,00265,B,an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics
p00266_B,00266,B,oh never mind
p00267_B,00267,B,i hated sawston you see
p00268_B,00268,B,so did and do i that s splendid go on
p00269_B,00269,B,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness
p00270_B,00270,B,petty selfishness
p00271_B,00271,B,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano
p00272_B,00272,B,why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent
p00273_B,00273,B,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now
p00274_B,00274,B,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position
p00275_B,00275,B,we were mad drunk with rebellion we had no common sense as soon as you came you saw and foresaw everything
p00276_B,00276,B,oh i don t think that
p00277_B,00277,B,i hope you see why i have troubled you with this long story women i heard you say the other day are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad all through me you see mr herriton it makes me specially unhappy it s the only time i ve ever gone into what my father calls real life and look what i ve made of it all that winter i seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and i don t know what and when the spring came i wanted to fight against the things i hated mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society i actually hated society for a day or two at monteriano i didn t see that all these things are invincible and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces thank you for listening to so much nonsense
p00278_B,00278,B,oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you
p00279_B,00279,B,i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live
p00280_B,00280,B,there is another great consolation against invincible mediocrity the meeting a fellow victim i hope that this is only the first of many discussions that we shall have together
p00281_B,00281,B,who is my little brother why have i never heard of him before grandmamma grandmamma who is my little brother who is my
p00282_B,00282,B,aunt harriet uncle phil grandmamma what do you suppose my little brother is doing now has he begun to play do italian babies talk sooner than us or would he be an english baby born abroad oh i do long to see him and be the first to teach him the ten commandments and the catechism
p00283_B,00283,B,really irma is getting too tiresome she forgot poor lilia soon enough
p00284_B,00284,B,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks
p00285_B,00285,B,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers
p00286_B,00286,B,what did you say
p00287_B,00287,B,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it
p00288_B,00288,B,and what happened this morning
p00289_B,00289,B,she asked if she could pray for her new father for the italian
p00290_B,00290,B,did you let her
p00291_B,00291,B,i got up without saying anything
p00292_B,00292,B,you must have felt just as you did when i wanted to pray for the devil
p00293_B,00293,B,he is the devil
p00294_B,00294,B,no harriet he is too vulgar
p00295_B,00295,B,i will thank you not to scoff against religion think of that poor baby irma is right to pray for him what an entrance into life for an english child
p00296_B,00296,B,my dear sister i can reassure you firstly the beastly baby is italian secondly it was promptly christened at santa deodata s and a powerful combination of saints watch over
p00297_B,00297,B,don t dear and harriet don t be so serious i mean not so serious when you are with irma she will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide
p00298_B,00298,B,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up
p00299_B,00299,B,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her
p00300_B,00300,B,hopeful indeed
p00301_B,00301,B,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one
p00302_B,00302,B,she might do it too
p00303_B,00303,B,i told her not to but we must watch her carefully without of course appearing to be suspicious
p00304_B,00304,B,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment
p00305_B,00305,B,we can but trust to our influence
p00306_B,00306,B,yes i have i came to ask you have any steps been taken
p00307_B,00307,B,about the baby
p00308_B,00308,B,yes
p00309_B,00309,B,as far as i know no steps mrs theobald may have decided on something but i have not heard of it
p00310_B,00310,B,i was meaning had you decided on anything
p00311_B,00311,B,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p00312_B,00312,B,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald
p00313_B,00313,B,but does not mrs theobald always take any initiative from you
p00314_B,00314,B,i sometimes have given her advice in the past i should not presume to do so now
p00315_B,00315,B,then is nothing to be done for the child at all
p00316_B,00316,B,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p00317_B,00317,B,the child came into the world through my negligence it is natural i should take an interest in it
p00318_B,00318,B,my dear caroline you must not brood over the thing let bygones be bygones the child should worry you even less than it worries us we never even mention it it belongs to another world
p00319_B,00319,B,of course if mrs theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable i must say i don t see any such i shall ask if i may join her in it for irma s sake and share in any possible expenses please would you let me know if she decides on anything i should like to join as well
p00320_B,00320,B,my dear how you throw about your money we would never allow it
p00321_B,00321,B,and if she decides on nothing please also let me know let me know in any case
p00322_B,00322,B,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it
p00323_B,00323,B,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities
p00324_B,00324,B,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to
p00325_B,00325,B,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain
p00326_B,00326,B,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott
p00327_B,00327,B,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it
p00328_B,00328,B,you talk like harriet
p00329_B,00329,B,and why not say if you choose that i talk like irma that child has seen the thing more clearly than any of us she longs for her little brother she shall have him i don t care if i am impulsive
p00330_B,00330,B,certainly he will never suppose that
p00331_B,00331,B,but what effect will the letter have on him
p00332_B,00332,B,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father
p00333_B,00333,B,dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out
p00334_B,00334,B,i don t know i m sure but if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted by return you should have sent a little sum to him oh i m not cynical at least i only go by what i know of him but i am weary of the whole show weary of italy weary weary weary sawston s a kind pitiful place isn t it i will go walk in it and seek comfort
p00335_B,00335,B,there are sure to be incidental expenses do you suppose we shall have difficulty with the man
p00336_B,00336,B,it depends
p00337_B,00337,B,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent
p00338_B,00338,B,i don t go by what i saw of him but by what i know of him
p00339_B,00339,B,well what do you conclude from that
p00340_B,00340,B,that he is a thoroughly wicked man
p00341_B,00341,B,yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children look at rodrigo borgia for example
p00342_B,00342,B,i have also seen examples of that in my district
p00343_B,00343,B,she fences well
p00344_B,00344,B,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed
p00345_B,00345,B,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano
p00346_B,00346,B,isn t it disheartening
p00347_B,00347,B,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price
p00348_B,00348,B,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go
p00349_B,00349,B,go where do sit down what s happened
p00350_B,00350,B,she won t accept won t accept the letter as final you must go to monteriano
p00351_B,00351,B,i won t i ve been and i ve failed i ll never see the place again i hate italy
p00352_B,00352,B,if you don t go she will
p00353_B,00353,B,abbott
p00354_B,00354,B,yes going alone would start this evening i offered to write she said it was too late too late the child if you please irma s brother to live with her to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates to go to school like a gentleman she paying oh you re a man it doesn t matter for you you can laugh but i know what people say and that woman goes to italy this evening
p00355_B,00355,B,then let her go let her mess with italy by herself she ll come to grief somehow italy s too dangerous too
p00356_B,00356,B,stop that nonsense philip i will not be disgraced by her i will have the child pay all we ve got for it i will have it
p00357_B,00357,B,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world
p00358_B,00358,B,harriet harriet shall go too harriet now will be invaluable
p00359_B,00359,B,did mother explain it all to you
p00360_B,00360,B,yes indeed mother has written me a really beautiful letter she describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings how she has tried by letter and it is no good nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back then she says there is nothing like personal influence you and philip will succeed where i have failed she says too that caroline abbott has been wonderful caroline feels it as keenly almost as us that is because she knows the man oh he must be loathsome goodness me i ve forgotten to pack the ammonia it has been a terrible lesson for caroline but i fancy it is her turning point i can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come
p00361_B,00361,B,absurd nonsense they talk about the heat supposing we were here for pleasure what could be more pleasurable than this
p00362_B,00362,B,did you hear though they are remarking on the cold i should never have thought it cold what a religion foreigners are a filthy nation i don t care if there are tunnels open the windows
p00363_B,00363,B,singles or returns
p00364_B,00364,B,a single for me i shall never get back alive
p00365_B,00365,B,sweet creature how helpful you will be when we come to signor carella
p00366_B,00366,B,do you suppose do you suppose i am going to enter that man s house
p00367_B,00367,B,then what have you come for pray for ornament
p00368_B,00368,B,to see that you do your duty
p00369_B,00369,B,oh thanks
p00370_B,00370,B,so mother told me for goodness sake get the tickets here comes that hot woman again she has the impudence to bow
p00371_B,00371,B,mother told you did she
p00372_B,00372,B,but do people live inside
p00373_B,00373,B,no
p00374_B,00374,B,what do they do there
p00375_B,00375,B,there is a caffe a prison a theatre a church walls a view
p00376_B,00376,B,not for me thank you
p00377_B,00377,B,nobody asked you miss you see now lilia was asked by such a nice young gentleman with curls all over his forehead and teeth just as white as father makes them but harriet do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place nothing at all
p00378_B,00378,B,nothing at all it s frightful
p00379_B,00379,B,i know it is but it s old awfully old
p00380_B,00380,B,beauty is the only test at least so you told me when i sketched old buildings for the sake i suppose of making yourself unpleasant
p00381_B,00381,B,oh i m perfectly right but at the same time i don t know so many things have happened here people have lived so hard and so splendidly i can t explain
p00382_B,00382,B,i shouldn t think you could it doesn t seem the best moment to begin your italy mania i thought you were cured of it by now instead will you kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive i do beg you will not be taken unawares this time
p00383_B,00383,B,first harriet i shall settle you at the stella d italia in the comfort that befits your sex and disposition then i shall make myself some tea after tea i shall take a book into santa deodata s and read there it is always fresh and cool
p00384_B,00384,B,i m not clever philip i don t go in for it as you know but i know what s rude and i know what s wrong
p00385_B,00385,B,meaning
p00386_B,00386,B,you what s the good of cleverness if a man s murdered a woman
p00387_B,00387,B,harriet i am hot to whom do you refer
p00388_B,00388,B,he her if you don t look out he ll murder you i wish he would
p00389_B,00389,B,tut tut tutlet you d find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient i heartily dislike the fellow but we know he didn t murder her in that letter though she said a lot she never said he was physically cruel
p00390_B,00390,B,he has murdered her the things he did things one can t even mention

p00420_B,00420,B,out
p00421_B,00421,B,why on earth did you say he was in
p00422_B,00422,B,now perfetta has gone for her basket when she returns she will lower it so then you will put your card into it then she will raise it thus by this means
p00423_B,00423,B,thank you here is my card has a young lady happened to call here lately a young english lady a young lady pale large tall a young lady
p00424_B,00424,B,perfetta is deaf when she chooses
p00425_B,00425,B,i was going to make myself some tea
p00426_B,00426,B,i should be grateful you see harriet knows nothing
p00427_B,00427,B,no more do i he was out
p00428_B,00428,B,but what s that to do with it
p00429_B,00429,B,he was out you find me as ignorant as you have left harriet
p00430_B,00430,B,what do you mean please please mr herriton don t be mysterious there isn t the time any moment harriet may be down and we shan t have decided how to behave to her sawston was different we had to keep up appearances but here we must speak out and i think i can trust you to do it otherwise we ll never start clear
p00431_B,00431,B,pray let us start clear permit me to begin by asking you a question in which capacity have you come to monteriano spy or traitor
p00432_B,00432,B,spy spy your mother has behaved dishonourably all through she never wanted the child no harm in that but she is too proud to let it come to me she has done all she could to wreck things she did not tell you everything she has told harriet nothing at all she has lied or acted lies everywhere i cannot trust your mother so i have come here alone all across europe no one knows it my father thinks i am in normandy to spy on mrs herriton don t let s argue if you are here to get the child i will help you if you are here to fail i shall get it instead of you
p00433_B,00433,B,it is hopeless to expect you to believe me but i can assert that we are here to get the child even if it costs us all we ve got my mother has fixed no money limit whatever i am here to carry out her instructions i think that you will approve of them as you have practically dictated them i do not approve of them they are absurd harriet also carries out your instructions she however approves of them and does not know that they proceed from you i think miss abbott you had better take entire charge of the rescue party i have asked for an interview with signor carella tomorrow morning do you acquiesce might i ask for details of your interview with him they might be helpful to me
p00434_B,00434,B,my interview how do you know of it
p00435_B,00435,B,from perfetta if it interests you
p00436_B,00436,B,who ever is perfetta
p00437_B,00437,B,the woman who must have let you in
p00438_B,00438,B,in where
p00439_B,00439,B,into signor carella s house
p00440_B,00440,B,mr herriton how could you believe her do you suppose that i would have entered that man s house knowing about him all that i do i think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady i hear you wanted harriet to go very properly she refused eighteen months ago i might have done such a thing but i trust i have learnt how to behave by now
p00441_B,00441,B,i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then
p00442_B,00442,B,not an interview an accident i am very sorry i meant you to have the chance of seeing him first though it is your fault you are a day late you were due here yesterday so i came yesterday and not finding you went up to the rocca you know that kitchen garden where they let you in and there is a ladder up to a broken tower where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills
p00443_B,00443,B,yes yes i know the rocca i told you of it
p00444_B,00444,B,so i went up in the evening for the sunset i had nothing to do he was in the garden it belongs to a friend of his
p00445_B,00445,B,and you talked
p00446_B,00446,B,it was very awkward for me but i had to talk he seemed to make me you see he thought i was here as a tourist he thinks so still he intended to be civil and i judged it better to be civil also
p00447_B,00447,B,and of what did you talk
p00448_B,00448,B,the weather there will be rain he says by tomorrow evening the other towns england myself about you a little and he actually mentioned lilia he was perfectly disgusting he pretended he loved her he offered to show me her grave the grave of the woman he has murdered
p00449_B,00449,B,my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower
p00450_B,00450,B,you may be right when i tried to pave the way so to speak to hint that he had not behaved as he ought well it was no good at all he couldn t or wouldn t understand
p00451_B,00451,B,harriet would say he has no sense of sin
p00452_B,00452,B,harriet may be right i am afraid
p00453_B,00453,B,if so perhaps he isn t sinful
p00454_B,00454,B,i know what he has done what he says and what he thinks is of very little importance
p00455_B,00455,B,i should like to hear though what he said about me is he preparing a warm reception
p00456_B,00456,B,oh no not that i never told him that you and harriet were coming you could have taken him by surprise if you liked he only asked for you and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago
p00457_B,00457,B,what a memory the fellow has for little things
p00458_B,00458,B,you did not think it a little thing at the time you told me he had assaulted you
p00459_B,00459,B,i lost my temper did he really what exactly did he say
p00460_B,00460,B,he said he was sorry pleasantly as italians do say such things but he never mentioned the baby once
p00461_B,00461,B,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset
p00462_B,00462,B,and he never mentioned the baby once
p00463_B,00463,B,the view from the rocca wasn t it fine
p00464_B,00464,B,what isn t fine here i wish i was harriet
p00465_B,00465,B,because harriet
p00466_B,00466,B,mr herriton come here look at this
p00467_B,00467,B,it reaches up to heaven and down to the other place is it to be a symbol of the town
p00468_B,00468,B,surely that isn t an opera bill
p00469_B,00469,B,lucia di lammermoor by the master donizetti unique representation this evening
p00470_B,00470,B,but is there an opera right up here
p00471_B,00471,B,why yes these people know how to live they would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all that is why they have got to have so much that is good however bad the performance is tonight it will be alive italians don t love music silently like the beastly germans the audience takes its share sometimes more
p00472_B,00472,B,can t we go
p00473_B,00473,B,but we re here to rescue a child
p00474_B,00474,B,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby
p00475_B,00475,B,three hours then or four or make him learn english ways at florence we get a nurse
p00476_B,00476,B,but harriet what if at first he was to refuse
p00477_B,00477,B,i don t know the meaning of the word i ve told the landlady that philip and i only want our rooms one night and we shall keep to it
p00478_B,00478,B,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man
p00479_B,00479,B,he s insolent to ladies we know but my brother can be trusted to bring him to his senses that woman philip whom you saw will carry the baby to the hotel of course you must tip her for it and try if you can to get poor lilia s silver bangles they were nice quiet things and will do for irma and there is an inlaid box i lent her lent not gave to keep her handkerchiefs in it s of no real value but this is our only chance don t ask for it but if you see it lying about just say
p00480_B,00480,B,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre
p00481_B,00481,B,theatres here and at such a moment
p00482_B,00482,B,we should hardly enjoy it with the great interview impending
p00483_B,00483,B,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous
p00484_B,00484,B,mother wouldn t like it it would be most unsuitable almost irreverent besides all that foreign theatres are notorious don t you remember those letters in the church family newspaper
p00485_B,00485,B,but this is an opera lucia di lammermoor sir walter scott classical you know
p00486_B,00486,B,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence
p00487_B,00487,B,good miss abbott you are coming too
p00488_B,00488,B,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats
p00489_B,00489,B,good gracious me i should never have thought of that as likely as not we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people one keeps on forgetting this is italy
p00490_B,00490,B,unfortunately i have no evening dress and if the seats
p00491_B,00491,B,oh that ll be all right we ll go as we are and buy the best we can get monteriano is not formal we do all right
p00492_B,00492,B,yes i know but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones we had no need to come to italy like guys
p00493_B,00493,B,don t you like it at all
p00494_B,00494,B,most awfully
p00495_B,00495,B,shish
p00496_B,00496,B,we must make a stand from the beginning they re talking
p00497_B,00497,B,it is tiresome but perhaps it isn t for us to interfere
p00498_B,00498,B,ridiculous babies
p00499_B,00499,B,why it is the famous hot lady of the apennines the one who had never never before
p00500_B,00500,B,ugh don t she will be very vulgar and i m sure it s even worse here than in the tunnel i wish we d never
p00501_B,00501,B,whose is it whose is it whose is it
p00502_B,00502,B,oh i ve written i left a note this afternoon
p00503_B,00503,B,friends a relative a brother fra filippo who has come all the way from england and never written
p00504_B,00504,B,i left a message
p00505_B,00505,B,thank you ladies there is not time at ten o clock then i want to speak to you alone at ten
p00506_B,00506,B,certainly
p00507_B,00507,B,yes rather
p00508_B,00508,B,i suppose you didn t settle anything
p00509_B,00509,B,why no how could i the fact is well i got taken by surprise but after all what does it matter there s no earthly reason why we shouldn t do the business pleasantly he s a perfectly charming person and so are his friends i m his friend now his long lost brother what s the harm i tell you miss abbott it s one thing for england and another for italy there we plan and get on high moral horses here we find what asses we are for things go off quite easily all by themselves my hat what a night did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before well as i was saying it s absurd to worry he s not a porky father he wants that baby as little as i do he s been ragging my dear mother just as he ragged me eighteen months ago and i ve forgiven him oh but he has a sense of humour
p00510_B,00510,B,this time the same place the same thing help me
p00511_B,00511,B,is signor carella in
p00512_B,00512,B,business
p00513_B,00513,B,business with me
p00514_B,00514,B,most important business
p00515_B,00515,B,before business you must get well this is the best wine
p00516_B,00516,B,perhaps you are engaged and as i am not very well
p00517_B,00517,B,you are not well enough to go back and i am not engaged ah now i understand now i see what frightened you but why did you never speak
p00518_B,00518,B,what a fine child signor carella and how nice of you to talk to it though i see that the ungrateful little fellow is asleep seven months no eight of course eight still he is a remarkably fine child for his age
p00519_B,00519,B,you must not stand let us sit on the loggia where it is cool i am afraid the room is very untidy
p00520_B,00520,B,posing a born artist s model
p00521_B,00521,B,but guess e manca questo
p00522_B,00522,B,this house is a large house
p00523_B,00523,B,exactly and when my poor wife died when my poor wife died i thought of having my relatives to live here my father wished to give up his practice at empoli my mother and sisters and two aunts were also willing but it was impossible they have their ways of doing things and when i was younger i was content with them but now i am a man i have my own ways do you understand
p00524_B,00524,B,yes i do it is a large house
p00525_B,00525,B,immense and the taxes but it will be better when ah but you have never guessed why i went to poggibonsi why it was that i was out when he called
p00526_B,00526,B,i cannot guess signor carella i am here on business
p00527_B,00527,B,but try
p00528_B,00528,B,i cannot i hardly know you
p00529_B,00529,B,but we are old friends and your approval will be grateful to me you gave it me once before will you give it now
p00530_B,00530,B,i have not come as a friend this time i am not likely signor carella to approve of anything you do
p00531_B,00531,B,oh signorina surely you approve of marriage
p00532_B,00532,B,where there is love
p00533_B,00533,B,where there is love
p00534_B,00534,B,do i understand that you are proposing to marry again i forbid you then i forbid you
p00535_B,00535,B,but why
p00536_B,00536,B,you have ruined one woman i forbid you to ruin another it is not a year since lilia died you pretended to me the other day that you loved her it is a lie you wanted her money has this woman money too
p00537_B,00537,B,why yes a little
p00538_B,00538,B,and i suppose you will say that you love her
p00539_B,00539,B,i shall not say it it will be untrue now my poor wife so you do not advise me but why should it be a failure
p00540_B,00540,B,how can it succeed where there is no love
p00541_B,00541,B,but she does love me i forgot to tell you that
p00542_B,00542,B,indeed
p00543_B,00543,B,passionately
p00544_B,00544,B,then god help her
p00545_B,00545,B,whatever i say displeases you signorina god help you for you are most unfair you say that i ill treated my dear wife it is not so i have never ill treated any one you complain that there is no love in this marriage i prove that there is and you become still more angry what do you want do you suppose she will not be contented glad enough she is to get me and she will do her duty well
p00546_B,00546,B,her duty
p00547_B,00547,B,why of course she knows why i am marrying her
p00548_B,00548,B,to succeed where lilia failed to be your housekeeper your slave you
p00549_B,00549,B,to look after the baby certainly
p00550_B,00550,B,the baby
p00551_B,00551,B,it is an english marriage i do not care about the money i am having her for my son did you not understand that
p00552_B,00552,B,no it is not necessary signor carella since you are tired of the baby
p00553_B,00553,B,not at all suitable
p00554_B,00554,B,a little more wine
p00555_B,00555,B,oh no thank you but marriage signor carella is a very serious step could you not manage more simply your relative for example
p00556_B,00556,B,empoli i would as soon have him in england
p00557_B,00557,B,england then he has a grandmother there you know mrs theobald
p00558_B,00558,B,he has a grandmother here no he is troublesome but i must have him with me i will not even have my father and mother too for they would separate us
p00559_B,00559,B,how
p00560_B,00560,B,they would separate our thoughts
p00561_B,00561,B,he is not much longer than my boot is he can you believe that in time his own boots will be as large and that he also
p00562_B,00562,B,but ought you to treat him like that
p00563_B,00563,B,father son this woman will do exactly what i tell her she is fond of children she is clean she has a pleasant voice she is not beautiful i cannot pretend that to you for a moment but she is what i require
p00564_B,00564,B,oh do take care you are squeezing it
p00565_B,00565,B,it is nothing if he cries silently then you may be frightened he thinks i am going to wash him and he is quite right
p00566_B,00566,B,wash him you here
p00567_B,00567,B,i had gone to the farmacia and was sitting there comfortably when suddenly i remembered that perfetta had heated water an hour ago over there look covered with a cushion i came away at once for really he must be washed you must excuse me i can put it off no longer
p00568_B,00568,B,i have wasted your time
p00569_B,00569,B,but why are you going excuse me if i wash him while we talk
p00570_B,00570,B,i have nothing more to say
p00571_B,00571,B,oh but stop a moment you have not seen him yet
p00572_B,00572,B,i have seen as much as i want thank you
p00573_B,00573,B,take him
p00574_B,00574,B,i must go at once
p00575_B,00575,B,who would have believed his mother was blonde for he is brown all over brown every inch of him ah but how beautiful he is and he is mine mine for ever even if he hates me he will be mine he cannot help it he is made out of me i am his father
p00576_B,00576,B,may i help you to wash him
p00577_B,00577,B,it is very kind of you especially in your beautiful dress he is nearly clean already why i take the whole morning there is so much more of a baby than one expects and perfetta washes him just as she washes clothes then he screams for hours my wife is to have a light hand ah how he kicks has he splashed you i am very sorry
p00578_B,00578,B,i am ready for a soft towel now
p00579_B,00579,B,certainly certainly
p00580_B,00580,B,and if you had any powder
p00581_B,00581,B,what is it
p00582_B,00582,B,well your business
p00583_B,00583,B,our business miss abbott has told you of that
p00584_B,00584,B,no
p00585_B,00585,B,but surely
p00586_B,00586,B,she came for business but she forgot about it so did i
p00587_B,00587,B,you mustn t accuse her of that though she is exasperating she hasn t come here to betray us
p00588_B,00588,B,then why has she come here answer me that bursting in on me crying and looking a disgusting sight and says she has been to see the italian couldn t even talk properly pretended she had changed her opinions what are her opinions to us i was very calm i said miss abbott i think there is a little misapprehension in this matter my mother mrs herriton oh goodness my head of course you ve failed don t trouble to answer i know you ve failed where s the baby pray of course you haven t got it dear sweet caroline won t let you oh yes and we re to go away at once and trouble the father no more those are her commands commands commands
p00589_B,00589,B,i ve not got the baby harriet but at the same time i haven t exactly failed i and signor carella are to have another interview this afternoon at the caffe garibaldi he is perfectly reasonable and pleasant should you be disposed to come with me you would find him quite willing to discuss things he is desperately in want of money and has no prospect of getting any i discovered that at the same time he has a certain affection for the child miss abbott has behaved extraordinarily but at the same time harriet you must listen my dear you must stop crying i have something quite important to say
p00590_B,00590,B,i shall not stop crying
p00591_B,00591,B,remember that miss abbott has done us no harm she said nothing to him about the matter he assumes that she is working with us i gathered that
p00592_B,00592,B,well she isn t
p00593_B,00593,B,yes but if you re careful she may be i interpret her behaviour thus she went to see him honestly intending to get the child away in the note she left me she says so and i don t believe she d lie
p00594_B,00594,B,i do
p00595_B,00595,B,when she got there there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism before very long if i know anything about psychology there will be a reaction she ll be swept back
p00596_B,00596,B,i don t understand your long words say plainly
p00597_B,00597,B,when she s swept back she ll be invaluable for she has made quite an impression on him he thinks her so nice with the baby you know she washed it for him
p00598_B,00598,B,disgusting
p00599_B,00599,B,if you want to carry off the baby keep your peace with miss abbott for if she chooses she can help you better than i can
p00600_B,00600,B,there can be no peace between me and her
p00601_B,00601,B,did you
p00602_B,00602,B,oh not all i wanted she went away before i had finished speaking just like those cowardly people into the church
p00603_B,00603,B,into santa deodata s
p00604_B,00604,B,yes i m sure she needs it anything more unchristian
p00605_B,00605,B,please is there an english lady here
p00606_B,00606,B,and please believe that i have not come to scold you i know what has happened
p00607_B,00607,B,what
p00608_B,00608,B,what might have happened to me he had made you believe that he loved the child
p00609_B,00609,B,oh yes he has he will never give it up
p00610_B,00610,B,at present it is still unsettled
p00611_B,00611,B,it will never be settled
p00612_B,00612,B,perhaps not well as i said i know what has happened and i am not here to scold you but i must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present harriet is furious but she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm and will do none
p00613_B,00613,B,i can do no more but i tell you plainly i have changed sides
p00614_B,00614,B,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella
p00615_B,00615,B,oh certainly i don t want to speak to him again i shan t ever see him again
p00616_B,00616,B,quite nice wasn t he
p00617_B,00617,B,quite
p00618_B,00618,B,well that s all i wanted to know i ll go and tell harriet of your promise and i think things ll quiet down now
p00619_B,00619,B,why aren t you angry with me
p00620_B,00620,B,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother
p00621_B,00621,B,you do understand wonderfully you are the only one of us who has a general view of the muddle so what are you going to do
p00622_B,00622,B,do this afternoon i have another interview
p00623_B,00623,B,it will come to nothing well
p00624_B,00624,B,then another if that fails i shall wire home for instructions i dare say we may fail altogether but we shall fail honourably
p00625_B,00625,B,that s not doing anything you would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby or if you went straight away but that to fail honourably to come out of the thing as well as you can is that all you are after
p00626_B,00626,B,why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns
p00627_B,00627,B,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all
p00628_B,00628,B,because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that
p00629_B,00629,B,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair
p00630_B,00630,B,you are wonderful
p00631_B,00631,B,oh you appreciate me i wish you didn t you appreciate us all see good in all of us and all the time you are dead dead dead look why aren t you angry you are so splendid mr herriton that i can t bear to see you wasted i can t bear she has not been good to you your mother
p00632_B,00632,B,miss abbott don t worry over me some people are born not to do things i m one of them i never did anything at school or at the bar i came out to stop lilia s marriage and it was too late i came out intending to get the baby and i shall return an honourable failure i never expect anything to happen now and so i am never disappointed you would be surprised to know what my great events are going to the theatre yesterday talking to you now i don t suppose i shall ever meet anything greater i seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it and i m sure i can t tell you whether the fate s good or evil i don t die i don t fall in love and if other people die or fall in love they always do it when i m just not there you are quite right life to me is just a spectacle which thank god and thank italy and thank you is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before
p00633_B,00633,B,i wish something would happen to you my dear friend i wish something would happen to you
p00634_B,00634,B,but why prove to me why i don t do as i am
p00635_B,00635,B,i retire to pack please remind signor carella philip that the baby is to be here by half past eight this evening
p00636_B,00636,B,oh certainly harriet i shall make a point of reminding him
p00637_B,00637,B,and order a carriage to take us to the evening train
p00638_B,00638,B,and please would you order a carriage for me too
p00639_B,00639,B,you going
p00640_B,00640,B,of course why not
p00641_B,00641,B,why of course you would be going two carriages then two carriages for the evening train harriet whatever are you up to we shall never be ready
p00642_B,00642,B,order my carriage for the evening train
p00643_B,00643,B,well i suppose i shall and i shall also have my interview with signor carella but why should you mind do you suppose that i shall have the slightest influence over him
p00644_B,00644,B,no but i can t repeat all that i said in the church you ought never to see him again you ought to bundle harriet into a carriage not this evening but now and drive her straight away
p00645_B,00645,B,perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it
p00646_B,00646,B,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever
p00647_B,00647,B,well you are right this affair is being managed by the ladies
p00648_B,00648,B,ah the ladies the ladies
p00649_B,00649,B,well i have done my best i shall face my mother with a good conscience will you bear me witness that i ve done my best
p00650_B,00650,B,my poor fellow i will
p00651_B,00651,B,and that i have mia sorella poor harriet one more wrench and it will all be over for her we are leaving this evening
p00652_B,00652,B,then you will not be here this evening as you promised us all three leaving
p00653_B,00653,B,all three by the night train at least that is my sister s plan so i m afraid i shan t be here
p00654_B,00654,B,good bye it s been a great pleasure to see you i hope that won t shift at all events
p00655_B,00655,B,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious
p00656_B,00656,B,i suppose i do
p00657_B,00657,B,it s hard luck on her she is a good person i must do for her anything i can
p00658_B,00658,B,did the lady give you this note speak up who gave it you and where
p00659_B,00659,B,ugh signora padrona find out from him this note is from my sister what does it mean where did he see her
p00660_B,00660,B,it is no good he understands everything but he can explain nothing
p00661_B,00661,B,he has visions of the saints
p00662_B,00662,B,but my sister where has she gone how has she met him
p00663_B,00663,B,she has gone for a walk she has gone for a walk perhaps to wish good bye to her little nephew preferring to come back another way she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you outside the siena gate many of my guests do this
p00664_B,00664,B,go on i have paid him plenty go on what am i to do it is not like the lady to be late we shall miss the train
p00665_B,00665,B,let us drive slowly and you shall call her by name as we go

p00686_B,00686,B,i say you haven t hurt it or held it the wrong way or anything it is too uncanny crying and no noise why didn t you get perfetta to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger it s a marvel he understood about the note
p00687_B,00687,B,oh he understands he tried to carry the baby

p00718_B,00718,B,he will have to marry her i heard from him this morning just as we left milan he finds he has gone too far to back out it would be expensive i don t know how much he minds not as much as we suppose i think at all events there s not a word of blame in the letter i don t believe he even feels angry i never was so completely forgiven ever since you stopped him killing me it has been a vision of perfect friendship he nursed me he lied for me at the inquest and at the funeral though he was crying you would have thought it was my son who had died certainly i was the only person he had to be kind to he was so distressed not to make harriet s acquaintance and that he scarcely saw anything of you in his letter he says so again
p00719_B,00719,B,thank him please when you write and give him my kindest regards
p00720_B,00720,B,indeed i will
p00721_B,00721,B,when will you see him again
p00722_B,00722,B,i hope next spring perhaps we shall paint siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money it was one of the arguments for marrying her
p00723_B,00723,B,he has no heart he does not really mind about the child at all
p00724_B,00724,B,no you re wrong he does he is unhappy like the rest of us but he doesn t try to keep up appearances as we do he knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again
p00725_B,00725,B,he said he would never be happy again
p00726_B,00726,B,in his passion not when he was calm we english say it when we are calm when we do not really believe it any longer gino is not ashamed of inconsistency it is one of the many things i like him for
p00727_B,00727,B,yes i was wrong that is so
p00728_B,00728,B,he s much more honest with himself than i am and he is honest without an effort and without pride but you miss abbott what about you will you be in italy next spring
p00729_B,00729,B,no
p00730_B,00730,B,i m sorry when will you come back do you think
p00731_B,00731,B,i think never
p00732_B,00732,B,for whatever reason

p00738_B,00738,B,have you told mrs herriton
p00739_B,00739,B,i wrote from monteriano i tried to explain things but she will never understand me her view will be that the affair is settled sadly settled since the baby is dead still it s over our family circle need be vexed no more she won t even be angry with you you see you have done us no harm in the long run unless of course you talk about harriet and make a scandal so that is my plan london and work what is yours
p00740_B,00740,B,poor harriet as if i dare judge harriet or anybody
p00741_B,00741,B,is harriet going to be all right
p00742_B,00742,B,she will soon be her old self
p00743_B,00743,B,i m clear enough about harriet s future and about parts of my own but i ask again what about yours
p00744_B,00744,B,sawston and work
p00745_B,00745,B,no
p00746_B,00746,B,why not
p00747_B,00747,B,you ve seen too much you ve seen as much and done more than i have
p00748_B,00748,B,but it s so different of course i shall go to sawston you forget my father and even if he wasn t there i ve a hundred ties my district i m neglecting it shamefully my evening classes the st james
p00749_B,00749,B,silly nonsense you re too good about a thousand times better than i am you can t live in that hole you must go among people who can hope to understand you i mind for myself i want to see you often again and again
p00750_B,00750,B,of course we shall meet whenever you come down and i hope that it will mean often
p00751_B,00751,B,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough
p00752_B,00752,B,we can write at all events
p00753_B,00753,B,you will write
p00754_B,00754,B,i will indeed
p00755_B,00755,B,but i say it s not enough you can t go back to the old life if you wanted to too much has happened
p00756_B,00756,B,i know that
p00757_B,00757,B,not only pain and sorrow but wonderful things that tower in the sunlight do you remember it and all you said to me the theatre even and the next day in the church and our times with gino
p00758_B,00758,B,all the wonderful things are over that is just where it is
p00759_B,00759,B,i don t believe it at all events not for me the most wonderful things may be to come
p00760_B,00760,B,the wonderful things are over
p00761_B,00761,B,miss abbott what is the matter with you i thought i understood you and i don t all those two great first days at monteriano i read you as clearly as you read me still i saw why you had come and why you changed sides and afterwards i saw your wonderful courage and pity and now you re frank with me one moment as you used to be and the next moment you shut me up you see i owe too much to you my life and i don t know what besides i won t stand it you ve gone too far to turn mysterious i ll quote what you said to me don t be mysterious there isn t the time i ll quote something else i and my life must be where i live you can t live at sawston
p00762_B,00762,B,it is tempting it is tempting not to be mysterious i ve wanted often to tell you and then been afraid i could never tell any one else certainly no woman and i think you re the one man who might understand and not be disgusted
p00763_B,00763,B,are you lonely is it anything like that
p00764_B,00764,B,yes i m terribly lonely or i wouldn t speak i think you must know already
p00765_B,00765,B,perhaps i do perhaps i could speak instead but if you will say the word plainly you ll never be sorry i will thank you for it all my life
p00766_B,00766,B,that i love him
p00767_B,00767,B,rather i love him too when i can forget how he hurt me that evening though whenever we shake hands
p00768_B,00768,B,you ve upset me i thought i was past all this you re taking it wrongly i m in love with gino don t pass it off i mean it crudely you know what i mean so laugh at me
p00769_B,00769,B,laugh at love
p00770_B,00770,B,yes pull it to pieces tell me i m a fool or worse that he s a cad say all you said when lilia fell in love with him that s the help i want i dare tell you this because i like you and because you re without passion you look on life as a spectacle you don t enter it you only find it funny or beautiful so i can trust you to cure me mr herriton isn t it funny he s not a gentleman nor a christian nor good in any way he s never flattered me nor honoured me but because he s handsome that s been enough the son of an italian dentist with a pretty face oh mr herriton isn t it funny i love him and i m not ashamed of it i love him and i m going to sawston and if i mayn t speak about him to you sometimes i shall die
p00771_B,00771,B,perhaps it is what the books call a passing fancy
p00772_B,00772,B,if i saw him often i might remember what he is like or he might grow old but i dare not risk it so nothing can alter me now
p00773_B,00773,B,well if the fancy does pass let me know
p00774_B,00774,B,oh you shall know quick enough
p00775_B,00775,B,but before you retire to sawston are you so mighty sure
p00776_B,00776,B,what of
p00777_B,00777,B,that you and he i was going to say whatever have you got in common
p00778_B,00778,B,nothing except the times we have seen each other
p00779_B,00779,B,which which times
p00780_B,00780,B,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round
p00781_B,00781,B,but through my fault he is parted from the child he loves and because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again
p00782_B,00782,B,don t talk of faults you re my friend for ever mr herriton i think only don t be charitable and shift or take the blame get over supposing i m refined that s what puzzles you get over that i say again don t be charitable if he had asked me i might have given myself body and soul that would have been the end of my rescue party but all through he took me for a superior being a goddess i who was worshipping every inch of him and every word he spoke and that saved me
p00783_B,00783,B,thank you thank you for everything
