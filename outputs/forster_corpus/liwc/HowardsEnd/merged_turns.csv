1,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],in that case it is far too sudden,1,1,Q1
2,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],who knows aunt juley who knows,2,2,Q2
3,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely,3,3,Q3
4,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],who knows,4,4,Q4
5,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],but margaret dear,5,5,Q5
6,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street,6,6,Q6
7,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret,7,7,Q7
8,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know,8,8,Q8
9,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do,9,9,Q9
10,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],exactly germans are too thorough,10,10,Q10
11,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone and that reminds me helen s letter,11,12,"Q11,Q12"
12,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down,13,13,Q13
13,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather,14,14,Q14
14,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],i gathered nothing,15,15,Q15
15,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],then in that case,16,16,Q16
16,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],in that case i can make no plans don t you see,17,17,Q17
17,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],on the contrary,18,18,Q18
18,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby,19,19,Q19
19,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],then in that case my dear why go down i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you,20,21,"Q20,Q21"
20,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],aunt juley i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering,22,23,"Q22,Q23"
21,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them,24,24,Q24
22,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk,25,26,"Q25,Q26"
23,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters,27,27,Q27
24,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say,28,28,Q28
25,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to,29,29,Q29
26,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off,30,30,Q30
27,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i think probably it must but slowly,31,31,Q31
28,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different,32,33,"Q32,Q33"
29,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me,34,34,Q34
30,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong,35,36,"Q35,Q36"
31,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],so uncivilised,37,37,Q37
32,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],oh i used an affected word i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen,38,38,Q38
33,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],only with helen,39,39,Q39

111,Paul,['Helen'],i love you,134,134,Q134
112,Margaret,['Helen'],i understand at least i understand as much as ever is understood of these things tell me now what happened on the monday morning,135,135,Q135
113,Helen,['Margaret'],it was over at once,136,136,Q136
114,Margaret,['Helen'],how helen,137,137,Q137
115,Helen,['Margaret'],i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times,138,138,Q138
116,Margaret,['Helen'],was paul there,139,139,Q139
117,Helen,['Margaret'],yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness,140,141,"Q140,Q141"
118,Margaret,['Helen'],i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife,142,142,Q142
119,Helen,['Margaret'],no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew,143,146,"Q143,Q144,Q145,Q146"
120,Margaret,['Helen'],knew what,147,147,Q147
121,Helen,['Margaret'],everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think,148,148,Q148
122,Margaret,['Helen'],oh she must have overheard you,149,149,Q149
123,Helen,['Margaret'],i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that,150,150,Q150
124,Margaret,['Helen'],to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end,151,152,"Q151,Q152"
125,Helen,['Margaret'],oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes,153,153,Q153
126,Margaret,['Helen'],don t you feel it now,154,154,Q154
127,Helen,['Margaret'],i remember paul at breakfast i shall never forget him he had nothing to fall back upon i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever,155,155,Q155
128,Margaret,['Helen'],amen,156,156,Q156
129,A Haughty And Magnificent Nephew,"['Margaret', 'Uncle Ernst']",do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst,157,157,Q157
130,Uncle Ernst,"['A Haughty And Magnificent Nephew', 'Margaret']",to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within,158,159,"Q158,Q159"
131,Margaret,"['Aunt Juley', 'Uncle Ernst']",papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god,160,161,"Q160,Q161"
132,Aunt Juley,['Helen'],whom is margaret talking to would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in,162,163,"Q162,Q163"

307,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be,358,358,Q358
308,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],mr wilcox possibly,359,359,Q359
309,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i knew it and there s mr wilcox,360,360,Q360
310,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans,361,362,"Q361,Q362"
311,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],it s as well to be prepared,363,363,Q363
312,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],no it s as well not to be prepared,364,364,Q364
313,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],why,365,365,Q365
314,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],because because i d sooner risk it,366,367,"Q366,Q367"
315,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],but imagine the evenings turn the electric light on here or there and it s almost the same room one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you ll see them and the next you yours and they ll see you impossible to sit out on the balconies impossible to water the plants or even speak imagine going out of the front door and they come out opposite at the same moment and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you d rather risk it,368,368,Q368
316,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],i hope to risk things all my life,369,369,Q369
317,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],oh margaret most dangerous,370,370,Q370
318,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money,371,371,Q371
319,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],oh shame what a shocking speech,372,372,Q372
320,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],money pads the edges of things god help those who have none,373,373,Q373
321,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],but this is something quite new,374,374,Q374
322,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin,375,375,Q375
323,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],i call that rather cynical,376,376,Q376
324,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them,377,377,Q377
325,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],that s more like socialism,378,378,Q378
326,Margaret,['Aunt Juley'],call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality,379,379,Q379
327,Aunt Juley,['Margaret'],there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh,380,380,Q380

366,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],i knew i know i have been too absurd all through i am very much ashamed i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me,422,423,"Q422,Q423"
367,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],it doesn t matter miss schlegel it is good of you to have come round so promptly,424,424,Q424
368,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],it does matter i have been rude to you and my sister is not even at home so there was not even that excuse,425,425,Q425
369,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],indeed,426,426,Q426
370,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],she has just gone to germany,427,427,Q427

373,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],i did think it best,430,430,Q430
374,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],now why,431,431,Q431
375,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],that s a most difficult question i think you put it best in your letter it was an instinct which may be wrong,432,432,Q432
376,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],it wasn t that your son still,433,433,Q433
377,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],oh no he often my paul is very young you see,434,434,Q434
378,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],then what was it,435,435,Q435
379,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],an instinct which may be wrong,436,436,Q436
380,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn t live together that s dreadfully probable i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another,437,437,Q437
381,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],these are indeed other words i had nothing so coherent in my head i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister,438,438,Q438
382,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],ah i have always been wanting to ask you how did you know helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things did paul tell you,439,439,Q439
383,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],there is nothing to be gained by discussing that,440,440,Q440
384,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it,441,441,Q441
385,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],i was certainly against taking mrs matheson s flat i knew it was opposite your house,442,442,Q442
386,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],but it s all right now,443,443,Q443
387,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],i think so,444,444,Q444

397,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],yes charles my elder son is married,455,455,Q455
398,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],indeed,456,456,Q456
399,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],we took the flat chiefly on that account and also that paul could get his african outfit the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s and she most kindly offered it to us so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly s people which we had not yet done fussell the father is in the indian army retired the brother is in the army the mother is dead charles and albert fussell have known one another some time they belong to the same club and are both devoted to golf dolly plays golf too though i believe not so well and they first met in a mixed foursome we all like her and are very much pleased they were married on the 11th a few days before paul sailed charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man so he made a great point of having it on the 11th the fussells would have preferred it after christmas but they were very nice about it there is dolly s photograph in that double frame,457,459,"Q457,Q458,Q459"
400,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],are you quite certain that i m not interrupting mrs wilcox,460,460,Q460

406,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],doesn t he care for travelling,466,466,Q466
407,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable his father gave him a car for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end,467,467,Q467
408,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],i suppose you have a garage there,468,468,Q468

414,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],no,474,474,Q474
415,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],oh it might interest you there are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk about four feet from the ground the country people put them in long ago and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark it will cure the toothache the teeth are almost grown over now and no one comes to the tree,475,475,Q475
416,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],i should i love folklore and all festering superstitions,476,476,Q476
417,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it,477,477,Q477
418,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],of course it did it would cure anything once,478,478,Q478
419,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],certainly i remember cases you see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it i was born there good bye miss schlegel good bye thank you for coming you have cheered me up,479,480,"Q479,Q480"

428,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],i m twenty nine that s not so wildly girlish what makes you say that do you mean that i have been gauche and rude,489,490,"Q489,Q490"
429,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],i only meant that i am fifty one and that to me both of you read it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly,491,491,Q491
430,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],oh i ve got it inexperience i m no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her,492,492,Q492
431,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],yes you have got it inexperience is the word,493,493,Q493
432,Margaret,['Mrs. Wilcox'],inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching,494,495,"Q494,Q495"
433,Mrs. Wilcox,['Margaret'],indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself,496,496,Q496
434,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i hope that your sister is safe in germany by now,497,497,Q497
435,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",yes thank you i heard on tuesday only on tuesday for they live right away at stettin did you ever know any one living at stettin,498,499,"Q498,Q499"
436,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",never,500,500,Q500
437,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses at least our cousins do but aren t particularly rich the town isn t interesting except for a clock that rolls its eyes and the view of the oder which truly is something special oh mrs wilcox you would love the oder the river or rather rivers there seem to be dozens of them are intense blue and the plain they run through an intensest green,501,501,Q501
438,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel,502,502,Q502
439,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo,503,503,Q503
440,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Margaret', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",what do the overhanging warehouses make of that,504,504,Q504
441,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously,505,505,Q505
442,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Margaret', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",is anything gained by that,506,506,Q506
443,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do,507,507,Q507
444,A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office,"['Margaret', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",i am not sure that i agree do you,508,508,Q508
445,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly,509,509,Q509
446,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly,510,510,Q510
447,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side,511,511,Q511
448,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side,512,512,Q512
449,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him,513,514,"Q513,Q514"
450,Margaret,"['A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form,515,515,Q515
451,Margaret,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs,516,516,Q516
452,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end,517,517,Q517
453,Margaret,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",then you ought to discussion keeps a house alive it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone,518,518,Q518
454,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",it cannot stand without them it cannot stand without them and i sometimes think but i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here,519,519,Q519
455,Margaret,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Mrs. Wilcox']",never mind us or her do say,520,520,Q520
456,Mrs. Wilcox,"['A Girl Opposite', 'A Young Man Low Down In The Education Office', 'Margaret']",i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men,521,521,Q521

1169,Margaret,['Helen'],that s better well where shall i begin when i arrived at waterloo no i ll go back before that because i m anxious you should know everything from the first the first was about ten days ago it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can t help any more than we can you know at least i know in my own case when a man has said to me so and so s a pretty girl i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so and long to tweak her ear it s a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it but it wasn t only this in mr wilcox s case i gather now,1310,1310,Q1310
1170,Helen,['Margaret'],then you love him,1311,1311,Q1311
1171,Margaret,['Helen'],it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years,1312,1312,Q1312
1172,Helen,['Margaret'],but loved him,1313,1313,Q1313
1173,Margaret,['Helen'],no,1314,1314,Q1314

1179,Margaret,['Helen'],but what has mr wilcox to do with paul,1320,1320,Q1320
1180,Helen,['Margaret'],but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger,1321,1321,Q1321
1181,Margaret,['Helen'],that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you,1322,1323,"Q1322,Q1323"
1182,Helen,['Margaret'],no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad,1324,1324,Q1324
1183,Margaret,['Helen'],i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me,1325,1326,"Q1325,Q1326"
1184,Helen,['Margaret'],and to me and to all women so one kissed paul,1327,1327,Q1327

1316,Henry,"['Helen', 'Margaret']",you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen,1467,1468,"Q1467,Q1468"

1577,Henry,['Margaret'],ten years ago,1756,1756,Q1756
1578,Helen,['Leonard'],mr wilcox is so illogical if we told him it was his duty to take you on he might refuse to do it the fact is he isn t properly educated i don t want to set you against him but you ll find him a trial,1757,1757,Q1757
1579,Leonard,['Helen'],i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel,1758,1758,Q1758
1580,Helen,['Leonard'],i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that,1759,1759,Q1759
1581,Leonard,['Helen'],i get no time for reading,1760,1760,Q1760
1582,Helen,['Leonard'],had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life,1761,1761,Q1761
1583,Leonard,['Helen'],i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists,1762,1762,Q1762
1584,Helen,['Leonard'],oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle,1763,1763,Q1763
1585,Leonard,['Helen'],may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i,1764,1764,Q1764
1586,Helen,['Leonard'],of course,1765,1765,Q1765
1587,Leonard,['Helen'],and your sister too,1766,1766,Q1766
1588,Helen,['Leonard'],of course all presentable people say i,1767,1767,Q1767
1589,Leonard,['Helen'],but mr wilcox he is not perhaps,1768,1768,Q1768
1590,Helen,['Leonard'],i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either,1769,1769,Q1769
1591,Leonard,['Helen'],quite so quite so,1770,1770,Q1770
1592,Helen,['Leonard'],mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired,1771,1771,Q1771
1593,Leonard,['Helen'],it s better she stops in her room,1772,1772,Q1772
1594,Helen,['Leonard'],shall i sit up with her,1773,1773,Q1773
1595,Leonard,['Helen'],no thank you she does not need company,1774,1774,Q1774
1596,Helen,['Leonard'],mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you,1775,1776,"Q1775,Q1776"
1597,Leonard,['Helen'],no oh no miss schlegel no,1777,1777,Q1777
1598,Helen,['Leonard'],because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common,1778,1778,Q1778
1599,Leonard,['Helen'],i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her,1779,1779,Q1779
1600,Helen,['Leonard'],how long have you been married,1780,1780,Q1780
1601,Leonard,['Helen'],nearly three years,1781,1781,Q1781
1602,Helen,['Leonard'],what did your people say,1782,1782,Q1782
1603,Leonard,['Helen'],they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether,1783,1783,Q1783
1604,Helen,['Leonard'],my good boy what a mess who are your people and your grandparents,1784,1785,"Q1784,Q1785"
1605,Leonard,['Helen'],they were just nothing at all agricultural labourers and that sort,1786,1786,Q1786
1606,Helen,['Leonard'],so from which part,1787,1787,Q1787
1607,Leonard,['Helen'],lincolnshire mostly but my mother s father he oddly enough came from these parts round here,1788,1788,Q1788
1608,Helen,['Leonard'],from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast,1789,1789,Q1789
1609,Leonard,['Helen'],oh i don t know,1790,1790,Q1790
1610,Helen,['Leonard'],excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now,1791,1792,"Q1791,Q1792"
1611,Leonard,['Helen'],i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not,1793,1793,Q1793
1612,Helen,['Leonard'],we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men,1794,1794,Q1794
1613,Leonard,['Helen'],don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking,1795,1795,Q1795
1614,Helen,['Leonard'],settle down to what,1796,1796,Q1796
1615,Leonard,['Helen'],oh just settle down,1797,1797,Q1797
1616,Helen,['Leonard'],and that s to be life how can you with all the beautiful things to see and do with music with walking at night,1798,1798,Q1798
1617,Leonard,['Helen'],walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful,1799,1799,Q1799
1618,Helen,['Leonard'],why not,1800,1800,Q1800
1619,Leonard,['Helen'],because i see one must have money,1801,1801,Q1801
1620,Helen,['Leonard'],well you re wrong,1802,1802,Q1802
1621,Leonard,['Helen'],i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream,1803,1803,Q1803
1622,Helen,['Leonard'],you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i,1804,1805,"Q1804,Q1805"
1623,Leonard,['Helen'],i wonder,1806,1806,Q1806
1624,Helen,['Leonard'],we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever,1807,1807,Q1807
1625,Leonard,['Helen'],i am as afraid of death as any one,1808,1808,Q1808
1626,Helen,['Leonard'],but not of the idea of death,1809,1809,Q1809
1627,Leonard,['Helen'],but what is the difference,1810,1810,Q1810
1628,Helen,['Leonard'],infinite difference,1811,1811,Q1811
1629,Leonard,['Helen'],i must be stupid,1812,1812,Q1812
1630,Helen,['Leonard'],death destroys a man the idea of death saves him so never give in,1813,1814,"Q1813,Q1814"

1636,Henry,['Margaret'],did you say that your sister is sleeping here after all,1820,1820,Q1820

1638,Henry,['Margaret'],is she to be shown up to your room,1822,1822,Q1822
1639,Margaret,['Henry'],i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed will you tell the servants about helen could some one go to carry her bag you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear,1823,1824,"Q1823,Q1824"
1640,Henry,['Margaret'],far too much screaming there,1825,1825,Q1825

1643,Margaret,['Henry'],leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference,1829,1829,Q1829
1644,Henry,['Margaret'],no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man,1830,1832,"Q1830,Q1831,Q1832"
1645,Margaret,['Henry'],it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess,1833,1833,Q1833
1646,Henry,['Margaret'],cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference,1834,1834,Q1834
1647,Margaret,['Henry'],not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast,1835,1837,"Q1835,Q1836,Q1837"
1648,Henry,['Margaret'],good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth,1838,1838,Q1838

1677,Helen,['Tibby'],as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though my head is rather wretched i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in not there,1871,1874,"Q1871,Q1872,Q1873,Q1874"

1683,Helen,['Tibby'],and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself,1882,1884,"Q1882,Q1883,Q1884"

1688,Tibby,['Helen'],do you want me to adjudicate that too had you not better consult an expert,1890,1890,Q1890
1689,Helen,['Tibby'],this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this,1891,1891,Q1891

1705,Henry,['Margaret'],my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special,1911,1912,"Q1911,Q1912"
1706,Margaret,['Henry'],why did you go there then,1913,1913,Q1913

1742,Margaret,['Dolly'],i gave no such orders perhaps she was airing the things she did undertake to light an occasional fire,1952,1952,Q1952
1743,Dolly,['Margaret'],it was far more than an air the floor sounds covered with books charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don t know,1953,1953,Q1953
1744,Margaret,['Dolly'],books dolly are you serious has she been touching our books,1954,1954,Q1954

1751,Dolly,['Margaret'],but the present was so expensive,1961,1961,Q1961
1752,Margaret,['Dolly'],why does that make any difference dolly,1962,1962,Q1962
1753,Dolly,['Margaret'],still when it costs over five pounds i didn t see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman now can you,1963,1963,Q1963
1754,Margaret,['Dolly'],you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married,1964,1964,Q1964
1755,Dolly,['Margaret'],oh mine was old earthenware stuff not worth a halfpenny evie s was quite different you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do evie didn t want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble,1965,1965,Q1965
1756,Margaret,['Dolly'],but miss avery said,1966,1966,Q1966
1757,Dolly,['Margaret'],it was a perfectly awful letter charles said it was the letter of a madman in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond,1967,1967,Q1967
1758,Margaret,['Dolly'],did she give any reasons,1968,1968,Q1968

1840,Henry,"['Margaret', 'Tibby']",just like helen,2065,2065,Q2065
1841,Margaret,"['Henry', 'Tibby']",that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer,2066,2066,Q2066
1842,Henry,"['Margaret', 'Tibby']",don t ask me i m a plain man of business i live and let live my advice to you both is don t worry margaret you ve got black marks again under your eyes you know that s strictly forbidden first your aunt then your sister no we aren t going to have it are we theobald i ll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband,2067,2068,"Q2067,Q2068"

1844,Henry,"['Margaret', 'Tibby']",i don t suppose i ever shall,2070,2070,Q2070
1845,Tibby,"['Henry', 'Margaret']",margaret s point is this our sister may be mad,2071,2071,Q2071
1846,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble,2072,2072,Q2072

1848,Tibby,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Margaret']",the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking,2074,2074,Q2074
1849,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",she has never behaved like this before then,2075,2075,Q2075
1850,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",of course not,2076,2076,Q2076
1851,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",well my dear how am i to know,2077,2077,Q2077
1852,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely,2078,2078,Q2078
1853,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",oh yes she and i have always hit it off together,2079,2079,Q2079
1854,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean,2080,2081,"Q2080,Q2081"
1855,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",you want to get hold of her that s the problem isn t it she has got to see a doctor,2082,2082,Q2082
1856,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",for all i know she has seen one already,2083,2083,Q2083

1858,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",how will you do that,2086,2086,Q2086
1859,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there,2087,2087,Q2087
1860,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me,2088,2088,Q2088
1861,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time,2089,2089,Q2089
1862,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",it s quite impossible,2090,2090,Q2090
1863,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",why,2091,2091,Q2091
1864,Tibby,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Margaret']",it doesn t seem impossible to me it is surely a very tippy plan,2092,2092,Q2092
1865,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame,2093,2094,"Q2093,Q2094"
1866,Tibby,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Margaret']",but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill,2095,2095,Q2095
1867,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t,2096,2096,Q2096

1869,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",i suppose so,2098,2098,Q2098
1870,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness,2099,2099,Q2099
1871,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",i deny it s madness,2100,2100,Q2100
1872,Henry,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Margaret', 'Tibby']",you said just now,2101,2101,Q2101
1873,Margaret,"['Charles Wilcox', 'Henry', 'Tibby']",it s madness when i say it but not when you say it,2102,2102,Q2102

2012,Helen,['Margaret'],i know no i don t what a detestable boy tibby was,2260,2260,Q2260

2037,Margaret,['Helen'],undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers,2288,2288,Q2288
2038,Helen,['Margaret'],what do you mean,2289,2289,Q2289
2039,Margaret,['Helen'],i don t know,2290,2290,Q2290
2040,Helen,['Margaret'],because i probably agree with you,2291,2291,Q2291
2041,Margaret,['Helen'],it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live,2292,2292,Q2292
2042,Helen,['Margaret'],i do agree but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago,2293,2293,Q2293
2043,Margaret,['Helen'],meaning that i was dead i felt it,2294,2294,Q2294
2044,Helen,['Margaret'],yes the house has a surer life than we even if it was empty and as it is i can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture after all wickham place was a grave meg i ve a startling idea,2295,2295,Q2295
2045,Margaret,['Helen'],what is it,2296,2296,Q2296
2046,Helen,['Margaret'],drink some milk to steady you no i won t tell you yet because you may laugh or be angry let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing then one would see really about my idea couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night,2297,2300,"Q2297,Q2298,Q2299,Q2300"
2047,Margaret,['Helen'],i don t think we could well do that,2301,2301,Q2301
2048,Helen,['Margaret'],here are beds tables towels,2302,2302,Q2302
2049,Margaret,['Helen'],i know but the house isn t supposed to be slept in and henry s suggestion was,2303,2303,Q2303
2050,Helen,['Margaret'],i require no suggestions i shall not alter anything in my plans but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you it will be something to look back on oh meg lovey do let s,2304,2304,Q2304
2051,Margaret,['Helen'],but helen my pet we can t without getting henry s leave of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate,2305,2305,Q2305
2052,Helen,['Margaret'],ducie street is his house this is ours our furniture our sort of people coming to the door do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk why not it s a moon,2306,2306,Q2306
2053,Margaret,['Helen'],i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles,2307,2307,Q2307
2054,Helen,['Margaret'],i know he won t like it but i am going to pass out of their lives what difference will it make in the long run if they say and she even spent the night at howards end,2308,2308,Q2308
2055,Margaret,['Helen'],how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before,2309,2309,Q2309
2056,Helen,['Margaret'],because my plans,2310,2310,Q2310
2057,Margaret,['Helen'],which you change in a moment,2311,2311,Q2311
2058,Helen,['Margaret'],then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home,2312,2312,Q2312
2059,Margaret,['Helen'],it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand,2313,2313,Q2313
2060,Helen,['Margaret'],yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you,2314,2315,"Q2314,Q2315"
2061,Margaret,['Helen'],i needn t say how much it would mean to me,2316,2316,Q2316
2062,Helen,['Margaret'],then let us,2317,2317,Q2317
2063,Margaret,['Helen'],it is no good hesitating shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave,2318,2318,Q2318
2064,Helen,['Margaret'],oh we don t want leave charles may say no,2319,2320,"Q2319,Q2320"

2066,Helen,['Margaret'],go if you like i should have stopped without leave,2322,2322,Q2322
2067,Margaret,['Helen'],expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing,2323,2323,Q2323
2068,Helen,['Margaret'],not a thing only an ending,2324,2324,Q2324
2069,Dolly,"['Henry', 'Margaret']",but the diddums can t listen he isn t nine months old,2325,2325,Q2325
2070,Henry,"['Dolly', 'Margaret']",that s not what i was saying,2326,2326,Q2326
2071,Henry,['Margaret'],is it what we feared,2327,2327,Q2327
2072,Margaret,['Henry'],it is,2328,2328,Q2328
2073,Henry,['Margaret'],dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring,2329,2330,"Q2329,Q2330"
2074,Margaret,['Henry'],no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end,2331,2332,"Q2331,Q2332"
2075,Henry,['Margaret'],one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you,2333,2334,"Q2333,Q2334"
2076,Margaret,['Henry'],seducer no i do not know her seducer s name,2335,2335,Q2335
2077,Henry,['Margaret'],would she not tell you,2336,2336,Q2336
2078,Margaret,['Henry'],i never even asked her who seduced her,2337,2337,Q2337
2079,Henry,['Margaret'],that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you,2338,2339,"Q2338,Q2339"
2080,Margaret,['Henry'],i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills,2340,2340,Q2340
2081,Henry,['Margaret'],as you like,2341,2341,Q2341
2082,Margaret,['Henry'],have you anything else to ask me henry,2342,2342,Q2342
2083,Henry,['Margaret'],next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us,2343,2343,Q2343
2084,Margaret,['Henry'],who is we,2344,2344,Q2344
2085,Henry,['Margaret'],i thought it best to ring up charles,2345,2345,Q2345
2086,Margaret,['Henry'],that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain,2346,2346,Q2346
2087,Henry,['Margaret'],he has at once gone to call on your brother,2347,2347,Q2347
2088,Margaret,['Henry'],that too was unnecessary,2348,2348,Q2348
2089,Henry,['Margaret'],let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name,2349,2349,Q2349
2090,Margaret,['Henry'],are we to make her seducer marry her,2350,2350,Q2350
2091,Henry,['Margaret'],if possible yes,2351,2351,Q2351
2092,Margaret,['Henry'],but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases,2352,2352,Q2352
2093,Henry,['Margaret'],in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life,2353,2353,Q2353
2094,Margaret,['Henry'],may i ask you my question now,2354,2354,Q2354
2095,Henry,['Margaret'],certainly my dear,2355,2355,Q2355
2096,Margaret,['Henry'],to morrow helen goes to munich,2356,2356,Q2356
2097,Henry,['Margaret'],well possibly she is right,2357,2357,Q2357
2098,Margaret,['Henry'],henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end,2358,2358,Q2358
2099,Henry,['Margaret'],why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel,2359,2359,Q2359
2100,Margaret,['Henry'],it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending,2360,2361,"Q2360,Q2361"
2101,Henry,['Margaret'],she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact,2362,2362,Q2362
2102,Margaret,['Henry'],exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it,2363,2363,Q2363
2103,Henry,['Margaret'],i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold,2364,2365,"Q2364,Q2365"
2104,Margaret,['Henry'],leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to,2366,2366,Q2366
2105,Henry,['Margaret'],if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps,2367,2367,Q2367
2106,Margaret,['Henry'],well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow,2368,2369,"Q2368,Q2369"
2107,Henry,['Margaret'],do you intend to sleep in a damp house too,2370,2370,Q2370
2108,Margaret,['Henry'],she cannot be left alone,2371,2371,Q2371
2109,Henry,['Margaret'],that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles,2372,2372,Q2372
2110,Margaret,['Henry'],i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him,2373,2373,Q2373
2111,Henry,['Margaret'],margaret my margaret,2374,2374,Q2374
2112,Margaret,['Henry'],what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all,2375,2375,Q2375
2113,Henry,['Margaret'],as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles,2376,2376,Q2376
2114,Margaret,['Henry'],in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property,2377,2377,Q2377
2115,Henry,['Margaret'],my dear you are forgetting yourself,2378,2378,Q2378
2116,Margaret,['Henry'],i think you yourself recommended plain speaking,2379,2379,Q2379
2117,Henry,['Margaret'],helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did,2380,2380,Q2380
2118,Margaret,['Henry'],no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough,2381,2381,Q2381
2119,Henry,['Margaret'],as i have actually been forgiven,2382,2382,Q2382
2120,Margaret,['Henry'],never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question,2383,2383,Q2383
2121,Henry,['Margaret'],i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once,2384,2384,Q2384
2122,Margaret,['Henry'],you have mentioned mrs wilcox,2385,2385,Q2385
2123,Henry,['Margaret'],i beg your pardon,2386,2386,Q2386
2124,Margaret,['Henry'],a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast,2387,2387,Q2387
2125,Henry,['Margaret'],you have not been yourself all day,2388,2388,Q2388
2126,Margaret,['Henry'],not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done,2389,2389,Q2389
2127,Henry,['Margaret'],the two cases are different,2390,2390,Q2390
2128,Margaret,['Henry'],in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry,2391,2391,Q2391
2129,Henry,['Margaret'],i perceive you are attempting blackmail it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end,2392,2392,Q2392
2130,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],i suppose you realise that you are your sister s protector,2393,2393,Q2393
2131,Tibby,['Charles Wilcox'],in what sense,2394,2394,Q2394
2132,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],if a man played about with my sister i d send a bullet through him but perhaps you don t mind,2395,2395,Q2395
2133,Tibby,['Charles Wilcox'],i mind very much,2396,2396,Q2396
2134,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],who d ye suspect then speak out man one always suspects some one,2397,2397,Q2397
2135,Tibby,['Charles Wilcox'],no one i don t think so,2398,2398,Q2398
2136,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],you are hiding something when you saw her last did she mention any one s name yes or no,2399,2400,"Q2399,Q2400"
2137,Tibby,['Charles Wilcox'],in my rooms she mentioned some friends called the basts,2401,2401,Q2401
2138,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],who are the basts,2402,2402,Q2402
2139,Tibby,['Charles Wilcox'],people friends of hers at evie s wedding,2403,2403,Q2403
2140,Charles Wilcox,['Tibby'],i don t remember but by great scott i do my aunt told me about some rag tag was she full of them when you saw her is there a man did she speak of the man or look here have you had any dealings with him i see you are in his confidence they met at your rooms oh what a family what a family god help the poor pater,2404,2405,"Q2404,Q2405"
2141,Helen,['Margaret'],one isolates i isolated mr wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill consequently i was full of pity and almost of revenge for weeks i had blamed mr wilcox only and so when your letters came,2406,2406,Q2406
2142,Margaret,['Helen'],i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others,2407,2407,Q2407
2143,Helen,['Margaret'],i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts,2408,2408,Q2408
2144,Margaret,['Helen'],looking back that was wrong of me,2409,2409,Q2409
2145,Helen,['Margaret'],looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul,2410,2411,"Q2410,Q2411"

2267,Helen,['Margaret'],about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree,2549,2550,"Q2549,Q2550"
2268,Margaret,['Helen'],i do not agree i do not,2551,2551,Q2551

2272,Helen,"['Margaret', 'Tom']",baby s not to try and stand there s something wanting in me i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least but i is it some awful appalling criminal defect,2555,2555,Q2555
2273,Margaret,['Helen'],it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him,2556,2556,Q2556
2274,Helen,['Margaret'],yes yes but what has leonard got out of life,2557,2557,Q2557

2283,Margaret,['Helen'],you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me,2568,2568,Q2568
2284,Helen,['Margaret'],i hope it will be permanent,2569,2569,Q2569

2286,Helen,['Margaret'],all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past,2571,2573,"Q2571,Q2572,Q2573"
