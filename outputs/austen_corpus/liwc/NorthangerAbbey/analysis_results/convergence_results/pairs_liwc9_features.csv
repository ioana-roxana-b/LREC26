00234,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,267,268,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0

00379,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,434,435,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00380,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,435,436,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00381,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,436,437,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00382,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,437,438,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00587,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,667,668,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00588,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,670,671,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
