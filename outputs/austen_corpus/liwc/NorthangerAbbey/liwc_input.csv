p00000_A,00000,A,i wish you could dance my dear i wish you could get a partner it would have been very shocking to have it torn would not it it is such a delicate muslin for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you
p00001_A,00001,A,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p00002_A,00002,A,yes my dear it is very uncomfortable indeed
p00003_A,00003,A,what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party
p00004_A,00004,A,aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here
p00005_A,00005,A,i wish we had any it would be somebody to go to
p00006_A,00006,A,very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now
p00007_A,00007,A,had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see
p00008_A,00008,A,no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid
p00009_A,00009,A,no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you must know somebody
p00010_A,00010,A,well miss morland i hope you have had an agreeable ball
p00011_A,00011,A,very agreeable indeed
p00012_A,00012,A,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p00013_A,00013,A,i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly
p00014_A,00014,A,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p00015_A,00015,A,no trouble i assure you madam have you been long in bath madam
p00016_A,00016,A,about a week sir
p00017_A,00017,A,really
p00018_A,00018,A,why should you be surprised sir
p00019_A,00019,A,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam
p00020_A,00020,A,never sir
p00021_A,00021,A,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms
p00022_A,00022,A,yes sir i was there last monday
p00023_A,00023,A,have you been to the theatre
p00024_A,00024,A,yes sir i was at the play on tuesday
p00025_A,00025,A,to the concert
p00026_A,00026,A,yes sir on wednesday
p00027_A,00027,A,and are you altogether pleased with bath
p00028_A,00028,A,yes i like it very well
p00029_A,00029,A,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow
p00030_A,00030,A,my journal
p00031_A,00031,A,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense
p00032_A,00032,A,indeed i shall say no such thing
p00033_A,00033,A,shall i tell you what you ought to say
p00034_A,00034,A,if you please
p00035_A,00035,A,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say
p00036_A,00036,A,but perhaps i keep no journal
p00037_A,00037,A,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal
p00038_A,00038,A,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side
p00039_A,00039,A,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars
p00040_A,00040,A,and what are they
p00041_A,00041,A,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar
p00042_A,00042,A,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way
p00043_A,00043,A,my dear catherine do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard
p00044_A,00044,A,that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam
p00045_A,00045,A,do you understand muslins sir
p00046_A,00046,A,particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin
p00047_A,00047,A,men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir
p00048_A,00048,A,i hope i am madam
p00049_A,00049,A,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown
p00050_A,00050,A,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p00051_A,00051,A,how can you be so
p00052_A,00052,A,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p00053_A,00053,A,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p00054_A,00054,A,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p00055_A,00055,A,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory
p00056_A,00056,A,i was not thinking of anything
p00057_A,00057,A,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me
p00058_A,00058,A,well then i will not
p00059_A,00059,A,how excessively like her brother miss morland is
p00060_A,00060,A,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p00061_A,00061,A,my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age
p00062_A,00062,A,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p00063_A,00063,A,oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho
p00064_A,00064,A,yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil
p00065_A,00065,A,are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know
p00066_A,00066,A,oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world
p00067_A,00067,A,dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you
p00068_A,00068,A,have you indeed how glad i am what are they all
p00069_A,00069,A,i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time
p00070_A,00070,A,yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid
p00071_A,00071,A,yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it
p00072_A,00072,A,scold them do you scold them for not admiring her
p00073_A,00073,A,yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men
p00074_A,00074,A,oh dear how can you say so
p00075_A,00075,A,i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings
p00076_A,00076,A,but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again
p00077_A,00077,A,not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so
p00078_A,00078,A,no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it
p00079_A,00079,A,it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels
p00080_A,00080,A,no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way
p00081_A,00081,A,sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume
p00082_A,00082,A,it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining
p00083_A,00083,A,do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know
p00084_A,00084,A,but it does not signify if they do
p00085_A,00085,A,signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance
p00086_A,00086,A,are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me
p00087_A,00087,A,oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair
p00088_A,00088,A,i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark
p00089_A,00089,A,very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description
p00090_A,00090,A,betray you what do you mean
p00091_A,00091,A,nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up and which way are they gone one was a very good looking young man
p00092_A,00092,A,they went towards the church yard
p00093_A,00093,A,well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it
p00094_A,00094,A,only perhaps we may overtake the two young men
p00095_A,00095,A,oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat
p00096_A,00096,A,but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all
p00097_A,00097,A,i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them oh these odious gigs how i detest them delightful mr morland and my brother
p00098_A,00098,A,how long do you think we have been running it from tetbury miss morland
p00099_A,00099,A,i do not know the distance
p00100_A,00100,A,i know it must be five and twenty by the time we have been doing it it is now half after one we drove out of the inn yard at tetbury as the town clock struck eleven and i defy any man in england to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness that makes it exactly twenty five
p00101_A,00101,A,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p00102_A,00102,A,ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can
p00103_A,00103,A,he does look very hot to be sure
p00104_A,00104,A,hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland
p00105_A,00105,A,i am sure i cannot guess at all
p00106_A,00106,A,curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine
p00107_A,00107,A,and i am sure i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
p00108_A,00108,A,neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash
p00109_A,00109,A,that was very good natured of you
p00110_A,00110,A,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p00111_A,00111,A,my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland
p00112_A,00112,A,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p00113_A,00113,A,i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day
p00114_A,00114,A,thank you
p00115_A,00115,A,i will drive you up lansdown hill tomorrow
p00116_A,00116,A,thank you but will not your horse want rest
p00117_A,00117,A,rest he has only come three and twenty miles today all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here
p00118_A,00118,A,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p00119_A,00119,A,forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown tomorrow mind i am engaged
p00120_A,00120,A,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00121_A,00121,A,a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you
p00122_A,00122,A,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p00123_A,00123,A,udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation
p00124_A,00124,A,i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting
p00125_A,00125,A,not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in them
p00126_A,00126,A,udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe
p00127_A,00127,A,no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant
p00128_A,00128,A,i suppose you mean camilla
p00129_A,00129,A,yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it
p00130_A,00130,A,i have never read it
p00131_A,00131,A,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p00132_A,00132,A,well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe
p00133_A,00133,A,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p00134_A,00134,A,he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family
p00135_A,00135,A,very very much indeed isabella particularly
p00136_A,00136,A,i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine may be proud of
p00137_A,00137,A,indeed i am i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there
p00138_A,00138,A,because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she
p00139_A,00139,A,yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath
p00140_A,00140,A,i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you
p00141_A,00141,A,yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
p00142_A,00142,A,my dear creature i am afraid i must leave you your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin i know you will not mind my going away and i dare say john will be back in a moment and then you may easily find me out good bye my dear love
p00143_A,00143,A,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00144_A,00144,A,well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health
p00145_A,00145,A,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p00146_A,00146,A,thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout
p00147_A,00147,A,that circumstance must give great encouragement
p00148_A,00148,A,at last i have got you my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other i have been quite wretched without you
p00149_A,00149,A,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p00150_A,00150,A,so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people
p00151_A,00151,A,look at that young lady with the white beads round her head it is mr tilney s sister
p00152_A,00152,A,oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you
p00153_A,00153,A,but what is all this whispering about what is going on
p00154_A,00154,A,there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter
p00155_A,00155,A,and is that likely to satisfy me do you think
p00156_A,00156,A,well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable i tell you mr morland i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners
p00157_A,00157,A,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p00158_A,00158,A,nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it
p00159_A,00159,A,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p00160_A,00160,A,well my dear i hope you have had an agreeable partner
p00161_A,00161,A,very agreeable madam
p00162_A,00162,A,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p00163_A,00163,A,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p00164_A,00164,A,no where is he
p00165_A,00165,A,he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you
p00166_A,00166,A,where can he be
p00167_A,00167,A,ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked you he is a very agreeable young man
p00168_A,00168,A,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p00169_A,00169,A,well miss morland i suppose you and i are to stand up and jig it together again
p00170_A,00170,A,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p00171_A,00171,A,well miss morland here i am have you been waiting long we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street how do you do mrs allen a famous ball last night was not it come miss morland be quick for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off they want to get their tumble over
p00172_A,00172,A,what do you mean where are you all going to
p00173_A,00173,A,going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down
p00174_A,00174,A,something was said about it i remember but really i did not expect you
p00175_A,00175,A,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p00176_A,00176,A,well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go
p00177_A,00177,A,you will not be frightened miss morland if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him old allen is as rich as a jew is not he old allen the man you are with
p00178_A,00178,A,oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich
p00179_A,00179,A,and no children at all
p00180_A,00180,A,no not any
p00181_A,00181,A,a famous thing for his next heirs he is your godfather is not he
p00182_A,00182,A,my godfather no
p00183_A,00183,A,but you are always very much with them
p00184_A,00184,A,yes very much
p00185_A,00185,A,aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now
p00186_A,00186,A,his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night
p00187_A,00187,A,lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of this that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all
p00188_A,00188,A,i cannot believe it
p00189_A,00189,A,oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help
p00190_A,00190,A,and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford
p00191_A,00191,A,oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way mine is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there
p00192_A,00192,A,yes it does give a notion and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much you do not really think mr thorpe that james s gig will break down
p00193_A,00193,A,break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds
p00194_A,00194,A,good heavens then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is
p00195_A,00195,A,well my dear here you are and i hope you have had a pleasant airing
p00196_A,00196,A,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p00197_A,00197,A,so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going
p00198_A,00198,A,you have seen mrs thorpe then
p00199_A,00199,A,yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce
p00200_A,00200,A,did you see anybody else of our acquaintance
p00201_A,00201,A,yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her
p00202_A,00202,A,did you indeed and did they speak to you
p00203_A,00203,A,yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family
p00204_A,00204,A,and what did she tell you of them
p00205_A,00205,A,oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else
p00206_A,00206,A,did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from
p00207_A,00207,A,yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse
p00208_A,00208,A,and are mr and mrs tilney in bath
p00209_A,00209,A,yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died
p00210_A,00210,A,and is mr tilney my partner the only son
p00211_A,00211,A,oh heavens my beloved catherine have i got you at last now mr morland i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age but i need not ask you for you look delightfully you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody i assure you my brother is quite in love with you already and as for mr tilney but that is a settled thing even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now his coming back to bath makes it too plain oh what would not i give to see him i really am quite wild with impatience my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world she saw him this morning you know you must introduce him to me is he in the house now look about for heaven s sake i assure you i can hardly exist till i see him
p00212_A,00212,A,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p00213_A,00213,A,oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it
p00214_A,00214,A,no indeed i should not
p00215_A,00215,A,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p00216_A,00216,A,how well your brother dances
p00217_A,00217,A,henry yes he does dance very well
p00218_A,00218,A,he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe you cannot think how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away
p00219_A,00219,A,when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us
p00220_A,00220,A,that never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith
p00221_A,00221,A,yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes
p00222_A,00222,A,i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty
p00223_A,00223,A,not very
p00224_A,00224,A,he never comes to the pump room i suppose
p00225_A,00225,A,yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father
p00226_A,00226,A,i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow
p00227_A,00227,A,perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall
p00228_A,00228,A,heyday miss morland what is the meaning of this i thought you and i were to dance together
p00229_A,00229,A,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p00230_A,00230,A,that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously
p00231_A,00231,A,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p00232_A,00232,A,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p00233_A,00233,A,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p00234_A,00234,A,but they are such very different things
p00235_A,00235,A,that you think they cannot be compared together
p00236_A,00236,A,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour
p00237_A,00237,A,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this
p00238_A,00238,A,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them
p00239_A,00239,A,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison
p00240_A,00240,A,no indeed i never thought of that
p00241_A,00241,A,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose
p00242_A,00242,A,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with
p00243_A,00243,A,and is that to be my only security alas alas
p00244_A,00244,A,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody
p00245_A,00245,A,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before
p00246_A,00246,A,yes quite more so indeed
p00247_A,00247,A,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks
p00248_A,00248,A,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months
p00249_A,00249,A,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer
p00250_A,00250,A,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there
p00251_A,00251,A,you are not fond of the country
p00252_A,00252,A,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another
p00253_A,00253,A,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country
p00254_A,00254,A,do i
p00255_A,00255,A,do you not
p00256_A,00256,A,i do not believe there is much difference
p00257_A,00257,A,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long
p00258_A,00258,A,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen
p00259_A,00259,A,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here
p00260_A,00260,A,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath
p00261_A,00261,A,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father
p00262_A,00262,A,oh dear i do believe it will be wet
p00263_A,00263,A,i thought how it would be
p00264_A,00264,A,no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve
p00265_A,00265,A,perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty
p00266_A,00266,A,oh that will not signify i never mind dirt
p00267_A,00267,A,no i know you never mind dirt
p00268_A,00268,A,it comes on faster and faster
p00269_A,00269,A,so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet
p00270_A,00270,A,there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella
p00271_A,00271,A,they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time
p00272_A,00272,A,it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry
p00273_A,00273,A,anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable you will not be able to go my dear
p00274_A,00274,A,i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather
p00275_A,00275,A,always thought it would clear up
p00276_A,00276,A,make haste make haste put on your hat this moment there is no time to be lost we are going to bristol how d ye do mrs allen
p00277_A,00277,A,my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston
p00278_A,00278,A,i doubt our being able to do so much
p00279_A,00279,A,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p00280_A,00280,A,blaize castle what is that
p00281_A,00281,A,the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see
p00282_A,00282,A,what is it really a castle an old castle
p00283_A,00283,A,the oldest in the kingdom
p00284_A,00284,A,but is it like what one reads of
p00285_A,00285,A,exactly the very same
p00286_A,00286,A,but now really are there towers and long galleries
p00287_A,00287,A,by dozens
p00288_A,00288,A,then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go
p00289_A,00289,A,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00290_A,00290,A,i cannot go because i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon
p00291_A,00291,A,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p00292_A,00292,A,i do not know indeed
p00293_A,00293,A,yes i know he does i saw him you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you
p00294_A,00294,A,yes
p00295_A,00295,A,well i saw him at that moment turn up the lansdown road driving a smart looking girl
p00296_A,00296,A,did you indeed
p00297_A,00297,A,did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too
p00298_A,00298,A,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p00299_A,00299,A,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p00300_A,00300,A,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p00301_A,00301,A,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p00302_A,00302,A,yes yes every hole and corner
p00303_A,00303,A,but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by
p00304_A,00304,A,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00305_A,00305,A,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p00306_A,00306,A,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00307_A,00307,A,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p00308_A,00308,A,who where
p00309_A,00309,A,on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now
p00310_A,00310,A,we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on today your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round
p00311_A,00311,A,if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own
p00312_A,00312,A,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p00313_A,00313,A,and why cannot he afford it
p00314_A,00314,A,because he has not money enough
p00315_A,00315,A,and whose fault is that
p00316_A,00316,A,do not be so dull my dearest creature you will quite break my heart it was amazingly shocking to be sure but the tilneys were entirely to blame why were not they more punctual it was dirty indeed but what did that signify i am sure john and i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where a friend is concerned that is my disposition and john is just the same he has amazing strong feelings good heavens what a delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never was so happy in my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself
p00317_A,00317,A,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p00318_A,00318,A,quite horrid
p00319_A,00319,A,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00320_A,00320,A,my dear you tumble my gown
p00321_A,00321,A,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p00322_A,00322,A,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p00323_A,00323,A,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible
p00324_A,00324,A,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence
p00325_A,00325,A,me i take offence
p00326_A,00326,A,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry
p00327_A,00327,A,i angry i could have no right
p00328_A,00328,A,he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you a gentleman like good sort of fellow as ever lived
p00329_A,00329,A,but how came you to know him
p00330_A,00330,A,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath
p00331_A,00331,A,oh nonsense how can you say so
p00332_A,00332,A,and what do you think i said well done general said i i am quite of your mind
p00333_A,00333,A,do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go
p00334_A,00334,A,it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday
p00335_A,00335,A,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p00336_A,00336,A,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p00337_A,00337,A,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00338_A,00338,A,no no no
p00339_A,00339,A,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00340_A,00340,A,catherine you must go
p00341_A,00341,A,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p00342_A,00342,A,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00343_A,00343,A,that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure
p00344_A,00344,A,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00345_A,00345,A,i hope i am not less so now but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right
p00346_A,00346,A,well i have settled the matter and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience i have been to miss tilney and made your excuses
p00347_A,00347,A,you have not
p00348_A,00348,A,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p00349_A,00349,A,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00350_A,00350,A,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00351_A,00351,A,let her go let her go if she will go
p00352_A,00352,A,well and do you think of going too
p00353_A,00353,A,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p00354_A,00354,A,no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable
p00355_A,00355,A,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p00356_A,00356,A,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p00357_A,00357,A,yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it
p00358_A,00358,A,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p00359_A,00359,A,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p00360_A,00360,A,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p00361_A,00361,A,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p00362_A,00362,A,that is just what i was going to say
p00363_A,00363,A,you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will
p00364_A,00364,A,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p00365_A,00365,A,you have been abroad then
p00366_A,00366,A,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say
p00367_A,00367,A,why not
p00368_A,00368,A,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p00369_A,00369,A,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
p00370_A,00370,A,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00371_A,00371,A,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion
p00372_A,00372,A,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p00373_A,00373,A,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home
p00374_A,00374,A,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p00375_A,00375,A,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p00376_A,00376,A,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00377_A,00377,A,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00378_A,00378,A,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00379_A,00379,A,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p00380_A,00380,A,to say the truth i do not much like any other
p00381_A,00381,A,indeed
p00382_A,00382,A,that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you
p00383_A,00383,A,yes i am fond of history
p00384_A,00384,A,i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books
p00385_A,00385,A,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p00386_A,00386,A,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it
p00387_A,00387,A,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p00388_A,00388,A,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words
p00389_A,00389,A,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p00390_A,00390,A,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london
p00391_A,00391,A,indeed and of what nature
p00392_A,00392,A,that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet
p00393_A,00393,A,good heaven where could you hear of such a thing
p00394_A,00394,A,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p00395_A,00395,A,you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect
p00396_A,00396,A,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00397_A,00397,A,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p00398_A,00398,A,riot what riot
p00399_A,00399,A,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p00400_A,00400,A,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p00401_A,00401,A,i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them
p00402_A,00402,A,no doubt but that is no explanation of the present
p00403_A,00403,A,what am i to do
p00404_A,00404,A,you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women
p00405_A,00405,A,miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company
p00406_A,00406,A,that is not enough be more serious
p00407_A,00407,A,miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half
p00408_A,00408,A,they set off at eight this morning and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria oh yes maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much
p00409_A,00409,A,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p00410_A,00410,A,yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything nay my beloved sweetest friend compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated
p00411_A,00411,A,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p00412_A,00412,A,you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you
p00413_A,00413,A,it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately
p00414_A,00414,A,morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody
p00415_A,00415,A,indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify
p00416_A,00416,A,oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice
p00417_A,00417,A,i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you
p00418_A,00418,A,for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond
p00419_A,00419,A,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p00420_A,00420,A,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria
p00421_A,00421,A,well miss morland i am come to bid you good bye
p00422_A,00422,A,shall not you be late at devizes
p00423_A,00423,A,a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland i say it is no bad notion
p00424_A,00424,A,i am sure i think it a very good one
p00425_A,00425,A,do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope
p00426_A,00426,A,yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible
p00427_A,00427,A,and then you know i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song
p00428_A,00428,A,may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney today and must now be going home
p00429_A,00429,A,nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me
p00430_A,00430,A,then why do you stay away so long
p00431_A,00431,A,that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you
p00432_A,00432,A,oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you
p00433_A,00433,A,but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable
p00434_A,00434,A,pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you
p00435_A,00435,A,and i hope i hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me
p00436_A,00436,A,oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful
p00437_A,00437,A,that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters
p00438_A,00438,A,perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about
p00439_A,00439,A,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p00440_A,00440,A,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil
p00441_A,00441,A,oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day
p00442_A,00442,A,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits
p00443_A,00443,A,how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you
p00444_A,00444,A,unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me
p00445_A,00445,A,that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart
p00446_A,00446,A,but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy
p00447_A,00447,A,oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment
p00448_A,00448,A,well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms
p00449_A,00449,A,and must i go
p00450_A,00450,A,do not you intend it i thought it was all settled
p00451_A,00451,A,nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself
p00452_A,00452,A,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world
p00453_A,00453,A,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions
p00454_A,00454,A,why what do you mean
p00455_A,00455,A,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so
p00456_A,00456,A,i do not understand you
p00457_A,00457,A,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well
p00458_A,00458,A,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible
p00459_A,00459,A,bravo an excellent satire on modern language
p00460_A,00460,A,but pray tell me what you mean
p00461_A,00461,A,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us
p00462_A,00462,A,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid
p00463_A,00463,A,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world
p00464_A,00464,A,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance
p00465_A,00465,A,and did isabella never change her mind before
p00466_A,00466,A,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her
p00467_A,00467,A,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself
p00468_A,00468,A,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general
p00469_A,00469,A,i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still
p00470_A,00470,A,then why did not you
p00471_A,00471,A,oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us
p00472_A,00472,A,he is very handsome indeed
p00473_A,00473,A,it is very charming indeed
p00474_A,00474,A,mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear
p00475_A,00475,A,it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself
p00476_A,00476,A,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p00477_A,00477,A,nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money
p00478_A,00478,A,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00479_A,00479,A,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p00480_A,00480,A,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p00481_A,00481,A,by the end of another week
p00482_A,00482,A,yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home
p00483_A,00483,A,i am very sorry for it if i had known this before
p00484_A,00484,A,well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend
p00485_A,00485,A,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p00486_A,00486,A,well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable
p00487_A,00487,A,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p00488_A,00488,A,this is my favourite place it is so out of the way
p00489_A,00489,A,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p00490_A,00490,A,psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it
p00491_A,00491,A,you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming
p00492_A,00492,A,i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp
p00493_A,00493,A,but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me
p00494_A,00494,A,oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents
p00495_A,00495,A,no indeed i cannot
p00496_A,00496,A,my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you
p00497_A,00497,A,with me dear isabella
p00498_A,00498,A,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance
p00499_A,00499,A,as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning
p00500_A,00500,A,but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house
p00501_A,00501,A,are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters
p00502_A,00502,A,yes yes there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so
p00503_A,00503,A,i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it
p00504_A,00504,A,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last
p00505_A,00505,A,you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment
p00506_A,00506,A,oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter
p00507_A,00507,A,but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened
p00508_A,00508,A,what always to be watched in person or by proxy
p00509_A,00509,A,psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent
p00510_A,00510,A,i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me
p00511_A,00511,A,my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts
p00512_A,00512,A,if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough
p00513_A,00513,A,do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you i hope your eyes are not tormented now
p00514_A,00514,A,my brother does know it
p00515_A,00515,A,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable
p00516_A,00516,A,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that
p00517_A,00517,A,then you will persuade him to go away
p00518_A,00518,A,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master
p00519_A,00519,A,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable
p00520_A,00520,A,and are you sure it is my brother s doing
p00521_A,00521,A,yes very sure
p00522_A,00522,A,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain
p00523_A,00523,A,is not it the same thing
p00524_A,00524,A,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment
p00525_A,00525,A,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him
p00526_A,00526,A,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick
p00527_A,00527,A,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another
p00528_A,00528,A,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little
p00529_A,00529,A,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother
p00530_A,00530,A,i can have no opinion on that subject
p00531_A,00531,A,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour
p00532_A,00532,A,you are a very close questioner
p00533_A,00533,A,am i i only ask what i want to be told
p00534_A,00534,A,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell
p00535_A,00535,A,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart
p00536_A,00536,A,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at
p00537_A,00537,A,well
p00538_A,00538,A,well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her
p00539_A,00539,A,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go
p00540_A,00540,A,but how can that be are not you with her
p00541_A,00541,A,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there
p00542_A,00542,A,how sorry you must be for that
p00543_A,00543,A,i am always sorry to leave eleanor
p00544_A,00544,A,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable
p00545_A,00545,A,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey
p00546_A,00546,A,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about
p00547_A,00547,A,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry
p00548_A,00548,A,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens
p00549_A,00549,A,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you
p00550_A,00550,A,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure
p00551_A,00551,A,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock
p00552_A,00552,A,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then
p00553_A,00553,A,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room
p00554_A,00554,A,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing
p00555_A,00555,A,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness
p00556_A,00556,A,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way
p00557_A,00557,A,but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth
p00558_A,00558,A,and how might you learn by accident or argument
p00559_A,00559,A,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers
p00560_A,00560,A,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose
p00561_A,00561,A,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within
p00562_A,00562,A,this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude woodston will make but a sombre appearance today
p00563_A,00563,A,is it a pretty place
p00564_A,00564,A,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p00565_A,00565,A,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p00566_A,00566,A,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p00567_A,00567,A,how were mr allen s succession houses worked
p00568_A,00568,A,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p00569_A,00569,A,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p00570_A,00570,A,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now
p00571_A,00571,A,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p00572_A,00572,A,a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary
p00573_A,00573,A,to be sure you must miss him very much
p00574_A,00574,A,a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other
p00575_A,00575,A,was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits her picture i suppose hangs in your father s room
p00576_A,00576,A,our friends from fullerton
p00577_A,00577,A,i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died
p00578_A,00578,A,it remains as it was i suppose
p00579_A,00579,A,yes entirely
p00580_A,00580,A,and how long ago may it be that your mother died
p00581_A,00581,A,she has been dead these nine years
p00582_A,00582,A,you were with her i suppose to the last
p00583_A,00583,A,eleanor
p00584_A,00584,A,my father only wanted me to answer a note
p00585_A,00585,A,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p00586_A,00586,A,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine
p00587_A,00587,A,i have been to see your mother s room
p00588_A,00588,A,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there
p00589_A,00589,A,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow
p00590_A,00590,A,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use
p00591_A,00591,A,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride
p00592_A,00592,A,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself
p00593_A,00593,A,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us
p00594_A,00594,A,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage
p00595_A,00595,A,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress
p00596_A,00596,A,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you
p00597_A,00597,A,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly
p00598_A,00598,A,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose
p00599_A,00599,A,no
p00600_A,00600,A,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal
p00601_A,00601,A,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her
p00602_A,00602,A,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin
p00603_A,00603,A,but your father was he afflicted
p00604_A,00604,A,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death
p00605_A,00605,A,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking
p00606_A,00606,A,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting
p00607_A,00607,A,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill
p00608_A,00608,A,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again
p00609_A,00609,A,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p00610_A,00610,A,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why
p00611_A,00611,A,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress
p00612_A,00612,A,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world
p00613_A,00613,A,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story
p00614_A,00614,A,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part
p00615_A,00615,A,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother
p00616_A,00616,A,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice
p00617_A,00617,A,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p00618_A,00618,A,her mother is a very good sort of woman
p00619_A,00619,A,what was her father
p00620_A,00620,A,a lawyer i believe they live at putney
p00621_A,00621,A,are they a wealthy family
p00622_A,00622,A,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p00623_A,00623,A,but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved
p00624_A,00624,A,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00625_A,00625,A,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p00626_A,00626,A,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p00627_A,00627,A,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p00628_A,00628,A,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before
p00629_A,00629,A,among all the great variety that you have known and studied
p00630_A,00630,A,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it
p00631_A,00631,A,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this
p00632_A,00632,A,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p00633_A,00633,A,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story
p00634_A,00634,A,but he will tell only half of it
p00635_A,00635,A,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days
p00636_A,00636,A,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p00637_A,00637,A,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it
p00638_A,00638,A,go away and why
p00639_A,00639,A,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure
p00640_A,00640,A,oh not seriously
p00641_A,00641,A,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay
p00642_A,00642,A,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify
p00643_A,00643,A,we are not calling it a good house we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow
p00644_A,00644,A,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p00645_A,00645,A,i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste
p00646_A,00646,A,well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage
p00647_A,00647,A,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p00648_A,00648,A,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her
p00649_A,00649,A,it will soon be as if you never had
p00650_A,00650,A,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself
p00651_A,00651,A,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause
p00652_A,00652,A,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her
p00653_A,00653,A,i am persuaded that he never did
p00654_A,00654,A,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him
p00655_A,00655,A,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment
p00656_A,00656,A,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p00657_A,00657,A,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p00658_A,00658,A,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p00659_A,00659,A,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p00660_A,00660,A,good heaven what can be the matter my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand
p00661_A,00661,A,errand to me
p00662_A,00662,A,how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you
p00663_A,00663,A,tis a messenger from woodston
p00664_A,00664,A,you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either
p00665_A,00665,A,my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton
p00666_A,00666,A,it will not be in my power catherine
p00667_A,00667,A,come when you can then monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home
p00668_A,00668,A,ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing
p00669_A,00669,A,have i offended the general
p00670_A,00670,A,alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible
p00671_A,00671,A,i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence
p00672_A,00672,A,i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended
p00673_A,00673,A,oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time
p00674_A,00674,A,i shall see you in the morning you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice
p00675_A,00675,A,no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe
p00676_A,00676,A,i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you
p00677_A,00677,A,my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding
p00678_A,00678,A,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p00679_A,00679,A,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping
p00680_A,00680,A,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00681_A,00681,A,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p00682_A,00682,A,i really have not patience with the general only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first
p00683_A,00683,A,yes but that did not last long
p00684_A,00684,A,very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening
p00685_A,00685,A,do i oh perfectly
p00686_A,00686,A,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p00687_A,00687,A,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p00688_A,00688,A,her head did not run upon bath much
p00689_A,00689,A,then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger
p00690_A,00690,A,i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat
p00691_A,00691,A,you may see the house from this window sir
p00000_B,00000,B,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p00001_B,00001,B,yes my dear it is very uncomfortable indeed
p00002_B,00002,B,what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party
p00003_B,00003,B,aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here
p00004_B,00004,B,i wish we had any it would be somebody to go to
p00005_B,00005,B,very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now
p00006_B,00006,B,had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see
p00007_B,00007,B,no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid
p00008_B,00008,B,no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you must know somebody
p00009_B,00009,B,i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back
p00010_B,00010,B,very agreeable indeed
p00011_B,00011,B,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p00012_B,00012,B,we shall do better another evening i hope
p00013_B,00013,B,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p00014_B,00014,B,no trouble i assure you madam have you been long in bath madam
p00015_B,00015,B,about a week sir
p00016_B,00016,B,really
p00017_B,00017,B,why should you be surprised sir
p00018_B,00018,B,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam
p00019_B,00019,B,never sir
p00020_B,00020,B,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms
p00021_B,00021,B,yes sir i was there last monday
p00022_B,00022,B,have you been to the theatre
p00023_B,00023,B,yes sir i was at the play on tuesday
p00024_B,00024,B,to the concert
p00025_B,00025,B,yes sir on wednesday
p00026_B,00026,B,and are you altogether pleased with bath
p00027_B,00027,B,yes i like it very well
p00028_B,00028,B,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow
p00029_B,00029,B,my journal
p00030_B,00030,B,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense
p00031_B,00031,B,indeed i shall say no such thing
p00032_B,00032,B,shall i tell you what you ought to say
p00033_B,00033,B,if you please
p00034_B,00034,B,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say
p00035_B,00035,B,but perhaps i keep no journal
p00036_B,00036,B,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal
p00037_B,00037,B,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side
p00038_B,00038,B,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars
p00039_B,00039,B,and what are they
p00040_B,00040,B,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar
p00041_B,00041,B,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way
p00042_B,00042,B,i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes
p00043_B,00043,B,that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam
p00044_B,00044,B,do you understand muslins sir
p00045_B,00045,B,particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin
p00046_B,00046,B,men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir
p00047_B,00047,B,i hope i am madam
p00048_B,00048,B,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown
p00049_B,00049,B,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p00050_B,00050,B,how can you be so
p00051_B,00051,B,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p00052_B,00052,B,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p00053_B,00053,B,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p00054_B,00054,B,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory
p00055_B,00055,B,i was not thinking of anything
p00056_B,00056,B,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me
p00057_B,00057,B,well then i will not
p00058_B,00058,B,thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much
p00059_B,00059,B,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p00060_B,00060,B,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p00061_B,00061,B,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p00062_B,00062,B,oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho
p00063_B,00063,B,yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil
p00064_B,00064,B,are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know
p00065_B,00065,B,oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world
p00066_B,00066,B,dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you
p00067_B,00067,B,have you indeed how glad i am what are they all
p00068_B,00068,B,i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time
p00069_B,00069,B,yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid
p00070_B,00070,B,yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it
p00071_B,00071,B,scold them do you scold them for not admiring her
p00072_B,00072,B,yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men
p00073_B,00073,B,oh dear how can you say so
p00074_B,00074,B,i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings
p00075_B,00075,B,but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again
p00076_B,00076,B,not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so
p00077_B,00077,B,no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it
p00078_B,00078,B,it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels
p00079_B,00079,B,no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way
p00080_B,00080,B,sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume
p00081_B,00081,B,it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining
p00082_B,00082,B,do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know
p00083_B,00083,B,but it does not signify if they do
p00084_B,00084,B,signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance
p00085_B,00085,B,are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me
p00086_B,00086,B,oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair
p00087_B,00087,B,i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark
p00088_B,00088,B,very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description
p00089_B,00089,B,betray you what do you mean
p00090_B,00090,B,nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up and which way are they gone one was a very good looking young man
p00091_B,00091,B,they went towards the church yard
p00092_B,00092,B,well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it
p00093_B,00093,B,only perhaps we may overtake the two young men
p00094_B,00094,B,oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat
p00095_B,00095,B,but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all
p00096_B,00096,B,i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them oh these odious gigs how i detest them delightful mr morland and my brother
p00097_B,00097,B,good heaven tis james
p00098_B,00098,B,i do not know the distance
p00099_B,00099,B,three and twenty
p00100_B,00100,B,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p00101_B,00101,B,ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can
p00102_B,00102,B,he does look very hot to be sure
p00103_B,00103,B,hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland
p00104_B,00104,B,i am sure i cannot guess at all
p00105_B,00105,B,curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine
p00106_B,00106,B,and i am sure i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
p00107_B,00107,B,neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash
p00108_B,00108,B,that was very good natured of you
p00109_B,00109,B,oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful
p00110_B,00110,B,my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland
p00111_B,00111,B,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p00112_B,00112,B,i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day
p00113_B,00113,B,thank you
p00114_B,00114,B,i will drive you up lansdown hill tomorrow
p00115_B,00115,B,thank you but will not your horse want rest
p00116_B,00116,B,rest he has only come three and twenty miles today all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here
p00117_B,00117,B,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p00118_B,00118,B,forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown tomorrow mind i am engaged
p00119_B,00119,B,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00120_B,00120,B,a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you
p00121_B,00121,B,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p00122_B,00122,B,udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation
p00123_B,00123,B,i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting
p00124_B,00124,B,not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in them
p00125_B,00125,B,udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe
p00126_B,00126,B,no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant
p00127_B,00127,B,i suppose you mean camilla
p00128_B,00128,B,yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it
p00129_B,00129,B,i have never read it
p00130_B,00130,B,you had no loss i assure you it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing at see saw and learning latin upon my soul there is not
p00131_B,00131,B,well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe
p00132_B,00132,B,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p00133_B,00133,B,he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family
p00134_B,00134,B,very very much indeed isabella particularly
p00135_B,00135,B,i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine may be proud of
p00136_B,00136,B,indeed i am i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there
p00137_B,00137,B,because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she
p00138_B,00138,B,yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath
p00139_B,00139,B,i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you
p00140_B,00140,B,yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
p00141_B,00141,B,indeed catherine i love you dearly
p00142_B,00142,B,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00143_B,00143,B,well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health
p00144_B,00144,B,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p00145_B,00145,B,thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout
p00146_B,00146,B,that circumstance must give great encouragement
p00147_B,00147,B,yes sir and dr skinner and his family were here three months so i tell mr allen he must not be in a hurry to get away
p00148_B,00148,B,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p00149_B,00149,B,so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people
p00150_B,00150,B,look at that young lady with the white beads round her head it is mr tilney s sister
p00151_B,00151,B,oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you
p00152_B,00152,B,but what is all this whispering about what is going on
p00153_B,00153,B,there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter
p00154_B,00154,B,and is that likely to satisfy me do you think
p00155_B,00155,B,well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable i tell you mr morland i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners
p00156_B,00156,B,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p00157_B,00157,B,nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it
p00158_B,00158,B,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p00159_B,00159,B,there you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me
p00160_B,00160,B,very agreeable madam
p00161_B,00161,B,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p00162_B,00162,B,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p00163_B,00163,B,no where is he
p00164_B,00164,B,he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you
p00165_B,00165,B,where can he be
p00166_B,00166,B,ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked you he is a very agreeable young man
p00167_B,00167,B,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p00168_B,00168,B,i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son
p00169_B,00169,B,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p00170_B,00170,B,do not you then let us walk about and quiz people come along with me and i will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room my two younger sisters and their partners i have been laughing at them this half hour
p00171_B,00171,B,what do you mean where are you all going to
p00172_B,00172,B,going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down
p00173_B,00173,B,something was said about it i remember but really i did not expect you
p00174_B,00174,B,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p00175_B,00175,B,well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go
p00176_B,00176,B,do just as you please my dear
p00177_B,00177,B,oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich
p00178_B,00178,B,and no children at all
p00179_B,00179,B,no not any
p00180_B,00180,B,a famous thing for his next heirs he is your godfather is not he
p00181_B,00181,B,my godfather no
p00182_B,00182,B,but you are always very much with them
p00183_B,00183,B,yes very much
p00184_B,00184,B,aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now
p00185_B,00185,B,his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night
p00186_B,00186,B,lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of this that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all
p00187_B,00187,B,i cannot believe it
p00188_B,00188,B,oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help
p00189_B,00189,B,and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford
p00190_B,00190,B,oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way mine is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there
p00191_B,00191,B,yes it does give a notion and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much you do not really think mr thorpe that james s gig will break down
p00192_B,00192,B,break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds
p00193_B,00193,B,good heavens then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is
p00194_B,00194,B,unsafe oh lord what is there in that they will only get a roll if it does break down and there is plenty of dirt it will be excellent falling oh curse it the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out lord bless you i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to york and back again without losing a nail
p00195_B,00195,B,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p00196_B,00196,B,so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going
p00197_B,00197,B,you have seen mrs thorpe then
p00198_B,00198,B,yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce
p00199_B,00199,B,did you see anybody else of our acquaintance
p00200_B,00200,B,yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her
p00201_B,00201,B,did you indeed and did they speak to you
p00202_B,00202,B,yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family
p00203_B,00203,B,and what did she tell you of them
p00204_B,00204,B,oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else
p00205_B,00205,B,did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from
p00206_B,00206,B,yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse
p00207_B,00207,B,and are mr and mrs tilney in bath
p00208_B,00208,B,yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died
p00209_B,00209,B,and is mr tilney my partner the only son
p00210_B,00210,B,i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well
p00211_B,00211,B,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p00212_B,00212,B,oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it
p00213_B,00213,B,no indeed i should not
p00214_B,00214,B,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p00215_B,00215,B,indeed you do me injustice i would not have made so improper a remark upon any account and besides i am sure it would never have entered my head
p00216_B,00216,B,henry yes he does dance very well
p00217_B,00217,B,he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe you cannot think how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away
p00218_B,00218,B,when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us
p00219_B,00219,B,that never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith
p00220_B,00220,B,yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes
p00221_B,00221,B,i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty
p00222_B,00222,B,not very
p00223_B,00223,B,he never comes to the pump room i suppose
p00224_B,00224,B,yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father
p00225_B,00225,B,i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow
p00226_B,00226,B,perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall
p00227_B,00227,B,i am glad of it for we shall all be there
p00228_B,00228,B,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p00229_B,00229,B,that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously
p00230_B,00230,B,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p00231_B,00231,B,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p00232_B,00232,B,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p00233_B,00233,B,but they are such very different things
p00234_B,00234,B,that you think they cannot be compared together
p00235_B,00235,B,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour
p00236_B,00236,B,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this
p00237_B,00237,B,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them
p00238_B,00238,B,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison
p00239_B,00239,B,no indeed i never thought of that
p00240_B,00240,B,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose
p00241_B,00241,B,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with
p00242_B,00242,B,and is that to be my only security alas alas
p00243_B,00243,B,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody
p00244_B,00244,B,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before
p00245_B,00245,B,yes quite more so indeed
p00246_B,00246,B,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks
p00247_B,00247,B,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months
p00248_B,00248,B,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer
p00249_B,00249,B,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there
p00250_B,00250,B,you are not fond of the country
p00251_B,00251,B,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another
p00252_B,00252,B,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country
p00253_B,00253,B,do i
p00254_B,00254,B,do you not
p00255_B,00255,B,i do not believe there is much difference
p00256_B,00256,B,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long
p00257_B,00257,B,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen
p00258_B,00258,B,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here
p00259_B,00259,B,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath
p00260_B,00260,B,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father
p00261_B,00261,B,oh
p00262_B,00262,B,i thought how it would be
p00263_B,00263,B,no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve
p00264_B,00264,B,perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty
p00265_B,00265,B,oh that will not signify i never mind dirt
p00266_B,00266,B,no i know you never mind dirt
p00267_B,00267,B,it comes on faster and faster
p00268_B,00268,B,so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet
p00269_B,00269,B,there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella
p00270_B,00270,B,they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time
p00271_B,00271,B,it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry
p00272_B,00272,B,anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable you will not be able to go my dear
p00273_B,00273,B,i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather
p00274_B,00274,B,always thought it would clear up
p00275_B,00275,B,isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call
p00276_B,00276,B,to bristol is not that a great way off but however i cannot go with you today because i am engaged i expect some friends every moment
p00277_B,00277,B,i doubt our being able to do so much
p00278_B,00278,B,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p00279_B,00279,B,blaize castle what is that
p00280_B,00280,B,the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see
p00281_B,00281,B,what is it really a castle an old castle
p00282_B,00282,B,the oldest in the kingdom
p00283_B,00283,B,but is it like what one reads of
p00284_B,00284,B,exactly the very same
p00285_B,00285,B,but now really are there towers and long galleries
p00286_B,00286,B,by dozens
p00287_B,00287,B,then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go
p00288_B,00288,B,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00289_B,00289,B,i cannot go because i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon
p00290_B,00290,B,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p00291_B,00291,B,i do not know indeed
p00292_B,00292,B,yes i know he does i saw him you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you
p00293_B,00293,B,yes
p00294_B,00294,B,well i saw him at that moment turn up the lansdown road driving a smart looking girl
p00295_B,00295,B,did you indeed
p00296_B,00296,B,did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too
p00297_B,00297,B,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p00298_B,00298,B,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p00299_B,00299,B,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p00300_B,00300,B,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p00301_B,00301,B,yes yes every hole and corner
p00302_B,00302,B,but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by
p00303_B,00303,B,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00304_B,00304,B,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p00305_B,00305,B,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00306_B,00306,B,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p00307_B,00307,B,who where
p00308_B,00308,B,on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now
p00309_B,00309,B,stop stop mr thorpe it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton
p00310_B,00310,B,it is all one to me
p00311_B,00311,B,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p00312_B,00312,B,and why cannot he afford it
p00313_B,00313,B,because he has not money enough
p00314_B,00314,B,and whose fault is that
p00315_B,00315,B,nobody s that i know of
p00316_B,00316,B,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p00317_B,00317,B,go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
p00318_B,00318,B,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00319_B,00319,B,my dear you tumble my gown
p00320_B,00320,B,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p00321_B,00321,B,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p00322_B,00322,B,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible
p00323_B,00323,B,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence
p00324_B,00324,B,me i take offence
p00325_B,00325,B,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry
p00326_B,00326,B,i angry i could have no right
p00327_B,00327,B,well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face
p00328_B,00328,B,but how came you to know him
p00329_B,00329,B,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath
p00330_B,00330,B,oh nonsense how can you say so
p00331_B,00331,B,and what do you think i said well done general said i i am quite of your mind
p00332_B,00332,B,do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go
p00333_B,00333,B,it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday
p00334_B,00334,B,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p00335_B,00335,B,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p00336_B,00336,B,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00337_B,00337,B,no no no
p00338_B,00338,B,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00339_B,00339,B,catherine you must go
p00340_B,00340,B,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p00341_B,00341,B,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00342_B,00342,B,that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure
p00343_B,00343,B,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00344_B,00344,B,i hope i am not less so now but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right
p00345_B,00345,B,i suspect there is no great struggle
p00346_B,00346,B,you have not
p00347_B,00347,B,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p00348_B,00348,B,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00349_B,00349,B,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00350_B,00350,B,let her go let her go if she will go
p00351_B,00351,B,she is as obstinate as
p00352_B,00352,B,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p00353_B,00353,B,no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable
p00354_B,00354,B,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p00355_B,00355,B,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p00356_B,00356,B,yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it
p00357_B,00357,B,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p00358_B,00358,B,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p00359_B,00359,B,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p00360_B,00360,B,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p00361_B,00361,B,that is just what i was going to say
p00362_B,00362,B,you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will
p00363_B,00363,B,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p00364_B,00364,B,you have been abroad then
p00365_B,00365,B,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say
p00366_B,00366,B,why not
p00367_B,00367,B,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p00368_B,00368,B,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
p00369_B,00369,B,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00370_B,00370,B,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion
p00371_B,00371,B,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p00372_B,00372,B,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home
p00373_B,00373,B,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p00374_B,00374,B,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p00375_B,00375,B,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00376_B,00376,B,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00377_B,00377,B,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00378_B,00378,B,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p00379_B,00379,B,to say the truth i do not much like any other
p00380_B,00380,B,indeed
p00381_B,00381,B,that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you
p00382_B,00382,B,yes i am fond of history
p00383_B,00383,B,i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books
p00384_B,00384,B,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p00385_B,00385,B,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it
p00386_B,00386,B,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p00387_B,00387,B,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words
p00388_B,00388,B,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p00389_B,00389,B,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london
p00390_B,00390,B,indeed and of what nature
p00391_B,00391,B,that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet
p00392_B,00392,B,good heaven where could you hear of such a thing
p00393_B,00393,B,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p00394_B,00394,B,you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect
p00395_B,00395,B,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00396_B,00396,B,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p00397_B,00397,B,riot what riot
p00398_B,00398,B,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p00399_B,00399,B,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p00400_B,00400,B,i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them
p00401_B,00401,B,no doubt but that is no explanation of the present
p00402_B,00402,B,what am i to do
p00403_B,00403,B,you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women
p00404_B,00404,B,miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company
p00405_B,00405,B,that is not enough be more serious
p00406_B,00406,B,miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half
p00407_B,00407,B,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me
p00408_B,00408,B,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p00409_B,00409,B,thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us
p00410_B,00410,B,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p00411_B,00411,B,you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you
p00412_B,00412,B,it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately
p00413_B,00413,B,morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody
p00414_B,00414,B,indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify
p00415_B,00415,B,oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice
p00416_B,00416,B,i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you
p00417_B,00417,B,for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond
p00418_B,00418,B,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p00419_B,00419,B,i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it tonight to salisbury we may have it tomorrow tomorrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me
p00420_B,00420,B,well miss morland i am come to bid you good bye
p00421_B,00421,B,shall not you be late at devizes
p00422_B,00422,B,a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland i say it is no bad notion
p00423_B,00423,B,i am sure i think it a very good one
p00424_B,00424,B,do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope
p00425_B,00425,B,yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible
p00426_B,00426,B,and then you know i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song
p00427_B,00427,B,may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney today and must now be going home
p00428_B,00428,B,nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me
p00429_B,00429,B,then why do you stay away so long
p00430_B,00430,B,that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you
p00431_B,00431,B,oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you
p00432_B,00432,B,but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable
p00433_B,00433,B,pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you
p00434_B,00434,B,and i hope i hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me
p00435_B,00435,B,oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful
p00436_B,00436,B,that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters
p00437_B,00437,B,perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about
p00438_B,00438,B,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p00439_B,00439,B,very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient
p00440_B,00440,B,oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day
p00441_B,00441,B,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits
p00442_B,00442,B,how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you
p00443_B,00443,B,unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me
p00444_B,00444,B,that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart
p00445_B,00445,B,but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy
p00446_B,00446,B,oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment
p00447_B,00447,B,well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms
p00448_B,00448,B,and must i go
p00449_B,00449,B,do not you intend it i thought it was all settled
p00450_B,00450,B,nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself
p00451_B,00451,B,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world
p00452_B,00452,B,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions
p00453_B,00453,B,why what do you mean
p00454_B,00454,B,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so
p00455_B,00455,B,i do not understand you
p00456_B,00456,B,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well
p00457_B,00457,B,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible
p00458_B,00458,B,bravo an excellent satire on modern language
p00459_B,00459,B,but pray tell me what you mean
p00460_B,00460,B,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us
p00461_B,00461,B,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid
p00462_B,00462,B,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world
p00463_B,00463,B,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance
p00464_B,00464,B,and did isabella never change her mind before
p00465_B,00465,B,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her
p00466_B,00466,B,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself
p00467_B,00467,B,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general
p00468_B,00468,B,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour
p00469_B,00469,B,then why did not you
p00470_B,00470,B,oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us
p00471_B,00471,B,he is very handsome indeed
p00472_B,00472,B,handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way
p00473_B,00473,B,mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear
p00474_B,00474,B,it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself
p00475_B,00475,B,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p00476_B,00476,B,nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money
p00477_B,00477,B,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00478_B,00478,B,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p00479_B,00479,B,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p00480_B,00480,B,by the end of another week
p00481_B,00481,B,yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home
p00482_B,00482,B,i am very sorry for it if i had known this before
p00483_B,00483,B,perhaps you would be so good it would make me very happy if
p00484_B,00484,B,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p00485_B,00485,B,well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable
p00486_B,00486,B,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p00487_B,00487,B,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world
p00488_B,00488,B,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p00489_B,00489,B,psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it
p00490_B,00490,B,you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming
p00491_B,00491,B,i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp
p00492_B,00492,B,but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me
p00493_B,00493,B,oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents
p00494_B,00494,B,no indeed i cannot
p00495_B,00495,B,my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you
p00496_B,00496,B,with me dear isabella
p00497_B,00497,B,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance
p00498_B,00498,B,as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning
p00499_B,00499,B,but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house
p00500_B,00500,B,are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters
p00501_B,00501,B,yes yes there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so
p00502_B,00502,B,i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it
p00503_B,00503,B,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last
p00504_B,00504,B,you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment
p00505_B,00505,B,oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter
p00506_B,00506,B,but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened
p00507_B,00507,B,my dearest catherine i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure
p00508_B,00508,B,psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent
p00509_B,00509,B,i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me
p00510_B,00510,B,my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts
p00511_B,00511,B,if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough
p00512_B,00512,B,do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you i hope your eyes are not tormented now
p00513_B,00513,B,never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little
p00514_B,00514,B,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable
p00515_B,00515,B,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that
p00516_B,00516,B,then you will persuade him to go away
p00517_B,00517,B,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master
p00518_B,00518,B,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable
p00519_B,00519,B,and are you sure it is my brother s doing
p00520_B,00520,B,yes very sure
p00521_B,00521,B,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain
p00522_B,00522,B,is not it the same thing
p00523_B,00523,B,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment
p00524_B,00524,B,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him
p00525_B,00525,B,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick
p00526_B,00526,B,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another
p00527_B,00527,B,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little
p00528_B,00528,B,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother
p00529_B,00529,B,i can have no opinion on that subject
p00530_B,00530,B,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour
p00531_B,00531,B,you are a very close questioner
p00532_B,00532,B,am i i only ask what i want to be told
p00533_B,00533,B,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell
p00534_B,00534,B,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart
p00535_B,00535,B,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at
p00536_B,00536,B,well
p00537_B,00537,B,well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her
p00538_B,00538,B,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go
p00539_B,00539,B,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month
p00540_B,00540,B,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there
p00541_B,00541,B,how sorry you must be for that
p00542_B,00542,B,i am always sorry to leave eleanor
p00543_B,00543,B,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable
p00544_B,00544,B,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey
p00545_B,00545,B,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about
p00546_B,00546,B,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry
p00547_B,00547,B,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens
p00548_B,00548,B,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you
p00549_B,00549,B,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure
p00550_B,00550,B,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock
p00551_B,00551,B,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then
p00552_B,00552,B,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room
p00553_B,00553,B,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing
p00554_B,00554,B,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness
p00555_B,00555,B,oh no no do not say so well go on
p00556_B,00556,B,no indeed
p00557_B,00557,B,and how might you learn by accident or argument
p00558_B,00558,B,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers
p00559_B,00559,B,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose
p00560_B,00560,B,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within
p00561_B,00561,B,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction
p00562_B,00562,B,is it a pretty place
p00563_B,00563,B,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p00564_B,00564,B,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p00565_B,00565,B,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p00566_B,00566,B,how were mr allen s succession houses worked
p00567_B,00567,B,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p00568_B,00568,B,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p00569_B,00569,B,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p00570_B,00570,B,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p00571_B,00571,B,a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary
p00572_B,00572,B,to be sure you must miss him very much
p00573_B,00573,B,a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other
p00574_B,00574,B,was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits her picture i suppose hangs in your father s room
p00575_B,00575,B,no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like
p00576_B,00576,B,i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died
p00577_B,00577,B,it remains as it was i suppose
p00578_B,00578,B,yes entirely
p00579_B,00579,B,and how long ago may it be that your mother died
p00580_B,00580,B,she has been dead these nine years
p00581_B,00581,B,you were with her i suppose to the last
p00582_B,00582,B,no i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over my father often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual
p00583_B,00583,B,my father only wanted me to answer a note
p00584_B,00584,B,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p00585_B,00585,B,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine
p00586_B,00586,B,i have been to see your mother s room
p00587_B,00587,B,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there
p00588_B,00588,B,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow
p00589_B,00589,B,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use
p00590_B,00590,B,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride
p00591_B,00591,B,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself
p00592_B,00592,B,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us
p00593_B,00593,B,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage
p00594_B,00594,B,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress
p00595_B,00595,B,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you
p00596_B,00596,B,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly
p00597_B,00597,B,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose
p00598_B,00598,B,no
p00599_B,00599,B,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal
p00600_B,00600,B,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her
p00601_B,00601,B,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin
p00602_B,00602,B,but your father was he afflicted
p00603_B,00603,B,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death
p00604_B,00604,B,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking
p00605_B,00605,B,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting
p00606_B,00606,B,tis only from james however
p00607_B,00607,B,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again
p00608_B,00608,B,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p00609_B,00609,B,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why
p00610_B,00610,B,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress
p00611_B,00611,B,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world
p00612_B,00612,B,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story
p00613_B,00613,B,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part
p00614_B,00614,B,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother
p00615_B,00615,B,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice
p00616_B,00616,B,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p00617_B,00617,B,her mother is a very good sort of woman
p00618_B,00618,B,what was her father
p00619_B,00619,B,a lawyer i believe they live at putney
p00620_B,00620,B,are they a wealthy family
p00621_B,00621,B,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p00622_B,00622,B,but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved
p00623_B,00623,B,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00624_B,00624,B,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p00625_B,00625,B,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p00626_B,00626,B,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p00627_B,00627,B,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before
p00628_B,00628,B,among all the great variety that you have known and studied
p00629_B,00629,B,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it
p00630_B,00630,B,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this
p00631_B,00631,B,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p00632_B,00632,B,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves
p00633_B,00633,B,but he will tell only half of it
p00634_B,00634,B,a quarter would be enough
p00635_B,00635,B,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p00636_B,00636,B,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it
p00637_B,00637,B,go away and why
p00638_B,00638,B,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure
p00639_B,00639,B,oh not seriously
p00640_B,00640,B,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay
p00641_B,00641,B,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify
p00642_B,00642,B,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return
p00643_B,00643,B,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p00644_B,00644,B,i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste
p00645_B,00645,B,well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage
p00646_B,00646,B,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p00647_B,00647,B,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her
p00648_B,00648,B,it will soon be as if you never had
p00649_B,00649,B,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself
p00650_B,00650,B,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause
p00651_B,00651,B,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her
p00652_B,00652,B,i am persuaded that he never did
p00653_B,00653,B,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him
p00654_B,00654,B,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment
p00655_B,00655,B,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p00656_B,00656,B,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p00657_B,00657,B,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p00658_B,00658,B,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p00659_B,00659,B,good heaven what can be the matter my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand
p00660_B,00660,B,errand to me
p00661_B,00661,B,how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you
p00662_B,00662,B,tis a messenger from woodston
p00663_B,00663,B,you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either
p00664_B,00664,B,my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton
p00665_B,00665,B,it will not be in my power catherine
p00666_B,00666,B,come when you can then monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home
p00667_B,00667,B,ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing
p00668_B,00668,B,have i offended the general
p00669_B,00669,B,alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible
p00670_B,00670,B,i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence
p00671_B,00671,B,i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended
p00672_B,00672,B,oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time
p00673_B,00673,B,i shall see you in the morning you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice
p00674_B,00674,B,no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe
p00675_B,00675,B,i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you
p00676_B,00676,B,oh eleanor i will write to you indeed
p00677_B,00677,B,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p00678_B,00678,B,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets
p00679_B,00679,B,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00680_B,00680,B,if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be we are sorry for him but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice
p00681_B,00681,B,i really have not patience with the general
p00682_B,00682,B,yes but that did not last long
p00683_B,00683,B,very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening
p00684_B,00684,B,do i oh perfectly
p00685_B,00685,B,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p00686_B,00686,B,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p00687_B,00687,B,her head did not run upon bath much
p00688_B,00688,B,then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger
p00689_B,00689,B,i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat
p00690_B,00690,B,there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good
p00691_B,00691,B,catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure
