p00000_A,00000,A,i must take leave to observe sir walter that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter,1,68.92,54.05,9.46,6.76,1.35,4.05,0,0,1.35,2.7,9.46,9.46,16.22,1.35,1.35,1.35,5.41

p00002_A,00002,A,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying,1,72.5,61.67,15.83,8.75,5,1.25,0.83,0.42,1.25,7.08,4.58,17.92,10,3.33,6.67,0.83,4.17

p00004_A,00004,A,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,1,76.99,61.06,15.04,13.27,2.65,0,3.54,0,7.08,1.77,5.31,13.27,12.39,7.96,8.85,1.77,0.88
p00005_A,00005,A,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier,1,69.92,62.41,15.79,12.03,8.27,0,0.75,3.01,0,3.76,6.02,16.54,12.78,1.5,5.26,2.26,3.01

p00189_A,00189,A,certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort,1,81.43,65.71,22.86,14.29,5.71,0,2.86,5.71,0,8.57,2.86,12.86,14.29,8.57,5.71,1.43,0

p00251_A,00251,A,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,1,73.03,64.04,22.47,13.48,7.87,0,0,5.62,0,8.99,4.49,14.61,7.87,11.24,5.62,2.25,0

p00253_A,00253,A,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,1,77.78,61.9,19.05,17.46,7.94,0,0,7.94,1.59,1.59,1.59,14.29,12.7,9.52,4.76,3.17,3.17
p00254_A,00254,A,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,1,71.26,64.94,21.26,14.94,5.17,0,2.87,6.32,0.57,6.32,5.17,13.22,10.34,2.3,8.05,2.3,2.87

p00260_A,00260,A,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,1,75.35,63.72,18.14,11.63,1.86,0,0.93,8.84,0,6.51,5.58,12.56,13.49,1.86,7.91,2.79,5.12
p00261_A,00261,A,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,1,84,66,20,12,6,2,2,2,0,8,0,12,12,12,4,4,10

p00272_A,00272,A,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you,1,83.52,67.03,24.18,17.58,2.2,0,9.89,5.49,0,6.59,3.3,15.38,9.89,8.79,6.59,1.1,4.4

p00274_A,00274,A,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,1,72.44,62.21,15.68,10.23,1.49,0.17,2.64,4.95,0.66,5.45,6.27,16.5,9.57,4.79,10.23,1.32,3.47
p00275_A,00275,A,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not,1,81.03,69.83,18.1,12.93,6.9,0,0.86,3.45,0,5.17,5.17,14.66,15.52,5.17,6.9,4.31,0.86
p00276_A,00276,A,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,1,67.98,56.18,16.29,12.92,2.81,0,1.69,7.87,0,3.37,5.06,11.8,10.11,2.81,7.3,2.81,2.25
p00277_A,00277,A,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness,1,81.97,67.21,16.39,11.48,6.56,0,0,3.28,0,4.92,1.64,16.39,18.03,4.92,3.28,1.64,6.56

p00250_B,00250,B,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man,1,73.03,64.04,22.47,13.48,7.87,0,0,5.62,0,8.99,4.49,14.61,7.87,11.24,5.62,2.25,0

p00252_B,00252,B,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back,1,77.78,61.9,19.05,17.46,7.94,0,0,7.94,1.59,1.59,1.59,14.29,12.7,9.52,4.76,3.17,3.17
p00253_B,00253,B,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other,1,71.26,64.94,21.26,14.94,5.17,0,2.87,6.32,0.57,6.32,5.17,13.22,10.34,2.3,8.05,2.3,2.87

p00256_B,00256,B,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character,1,71.43,57.14,24.29,14.29,7.14,0,4.29,2.86,0,10,1.43,8.57,8.57,7.14,2.86,1.43,2.86
p00257_B,00257,B,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty,1,76.29,61.86,13.4,8.25,5.15,2.06,0,1.03,0,5.15,6.19,13.4,10.31,8.25,9.28,1.03,2.06

p00259_B,00259,B,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,1,75.35,63.72,18.14,11.63,1.86,0,0.93,8.84,0,6.51,5.58,12.56,13.49,1.86,7.91,2.79,5.12
p00260_B,00260,B,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now,1,84,66,20,12,6,2,2,2,0,8,0,12,12,12,4,4,10

p00273_B,00273,B,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do,1,72.44,62.21,15.68,10.23,1.49,0.17,2.64,4.95,0.66,5.45,6.27,16.5,9.57,4.79,10.23,1.32,3.47
p00274_B,00274,B,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not,1,81.03,69.83,18.1,12.93,6.9,0,0.86,3.45,0,5.17,5.17,14.66,15.52,5.17,6.9,4.31,0.86
p00275_B,00275,B,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation,1,67.98,56.18,16.29,12.92,2.81,0,1.69,7.87,0,3.37,5.06,11.8,10.11,2.81,7.3,2.81,2.25
