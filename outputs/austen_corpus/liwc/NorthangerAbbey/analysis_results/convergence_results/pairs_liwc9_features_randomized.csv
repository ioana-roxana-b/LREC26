00067,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,22,285,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam,do i,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00068,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,24,599,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00072,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,32,671,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00073,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,34,25,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense,yes sir i was there last monday,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00074,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,36,275,shall i tell you what you ought to say,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00075,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,38,606,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00076,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,40,661,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
00077,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,42,593,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars,am i i only ask what i want to be told,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00078,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,44,277,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,yes quite more so indeed,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
00079,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,54,438,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00080,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,59,663,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00081,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,61,416,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
00082,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,264,585,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00083,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,266,659,that you think they cannot be compared together,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
00084,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,268,369,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00085,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,270,687,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00086,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,272,267,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
00087,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,274,287,and is that to be my only security alas alas,i do not believe there is much difference,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1
00088,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,276,291,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00089,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,278,701,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00090,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,280,681,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00091,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,282,35,you are not fond of the country,indeed i shall say no such thing,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
00092,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,284,579,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00093,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,286,436,do you not,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00094,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,288,271,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long,no indeed i never thought of that,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00095,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,290,699,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00096,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,292,365,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00097,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,364,614,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00098,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,366,677,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,tis only from james however,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
00099,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,368,685,me i take offence,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
00100,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,370,713,i angry i could have no right,oh not seriously,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
00101,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,413,724,you have been abroad then,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00102,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,415,597,why not,well,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
00103,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,419,41,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00104,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,421,269,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00105,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,435,689,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,her mother is a very good sort of woman,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
00106,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,437,414,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00107,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,507,591,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00108,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,509,19,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,about a week sir,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
00109,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,511,657,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well,i have been to see your mother s room,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
00110,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,513,39,bravo an excellent satire on modern language,but perhaps i keep no journal,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
00111,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,515,667,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00112,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,517,45,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00113,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,519,581,and did isabella never change her mind before,yes very sure,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
00114,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,521,60,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,i was not thinking of anything,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00115,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,574,281,my brother does know it,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00116,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,576,575,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00117,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,578,512,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

00119,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,582,728,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00120,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,584,289,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00122,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,588,624,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

00126,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,596,265,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at,but they are such very different things,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
00127,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,598,43,well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her,and what are they,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00128,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,603,273,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

00130,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,607,589,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00131,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,609,618,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry,oh no no do not say so well go on,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
00132,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,611,604,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,how sorry you must be for that,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00133,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,613,23,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,never sir,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
00134,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,615,422,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00135,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,617,367,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00136,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,623,283,and how might you learn by accident or argument,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00137,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,625,577,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,then you will persuade him to go away,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00138,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,656,31,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine,yes i like it very well,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00139,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,658,518,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00140,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,660,595,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00141,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,662,706,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself,but he will tell only half of it,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00142,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,664,730,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage,it is very right that you should stand by your brother,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00143,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,666,420,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00144,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,668,21,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,why should you be surprised sir,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00145,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,670,610,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00146,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,672,583,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,is not it the same thing,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
00147,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,674,520,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00148,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,676,612,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0
00149,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,680,669,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,no,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
00150,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,682,371,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress,well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
00151,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,684,665,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00152,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,686,715,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00153,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,688,279,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00154,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,698,514,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals,but pray tell me what you mean,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

00156,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,702,626,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

00158,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,710,683,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00162,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,725,726,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00163,Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,727,703,i am persuaded that he never did,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00171,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,29,34,yes sir on wednesday,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00172,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,31,28,yes i like it very well,to the concert,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

00174,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,35,596,indeed i shall say no such thing,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00175,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,37,674,if you please,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00176,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,39,26,but perhaps i keep no journal,have you been to the theatre,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
00177,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,41,366,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00178,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,43,680,and what are they,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00179,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,45,44,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
00180,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,60,423,i was not thinking of anything,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00181,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,62,617,well then i will not,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00182,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,265,437,but they are such very different things,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00183,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,267,447,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00184,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,269,280,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00185,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,271,278,no indeed i never thought of that,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00186,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,273,521,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00187,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,275,290,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00188,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,277,580,yes quite more so indeed,and are you sure it is my brother s doing,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00189,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,279,270,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00190,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,281,590,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there,i can have no opinion on that subject,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00191,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,283,370,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another,i angry i could have no right,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00192,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,285,727,do i,i am persuaded that he never did,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
00193,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,287,668,i do not believe there is much difference,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00194,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,289,36,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,shall i tell you what you ought to say,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00195,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,291,662,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00196,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,365,672,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00197,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,367,274,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence,and is that to be my only security alas alas,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00198,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,369,658,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there,Henry Tilney; Mrs. Allen,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00199,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,412,415,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france,why not,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
00200,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,414,615,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00201,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,416,603,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00202,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,420,592,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,you are a very close questioner,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00203,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,422,729,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00204,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,425,725,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00205,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,434,613,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00206,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,436,42,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00207,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,446,272,riot what riot,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00208,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,506,688,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00209,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,508,421,why what do you mean,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00210,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,510,684,i do not understand you,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00211,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,512,20,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible,really,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
00212,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,514,656,but pray tell me what you mean,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00213,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,516,40,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00214,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,518,666,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00215,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,520,46,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her,i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00216,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,522,584,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00217,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,575,63,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable,thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00218,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,577,284,then you will persuade him to go away,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00219,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,579,523,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00220,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,581,511,yes very sure,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00221,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,583,30,is not it the same thing,and are you altogether pleased with bath,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00222,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,585,627,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00223,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,587,292,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00224,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,589,509,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00225,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,591,625,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00226,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,593,507,am i i only ask what i want to be told,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00227,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,595,61,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00228,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,597,682,well,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00229,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,599,268,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00230,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,602,276,but how can that be are not you with her,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00231,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,604,38,how sorry you must be for that,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00232,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,606,588,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00233,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,608,702,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00234,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,610,600,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00235,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,612,611,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00236,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,614,24,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00237,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,616,435,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00238,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,622,413,but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth,you have been abroad then,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
00239,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,624,286,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers,do you not,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00240,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,626,576,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0
00241,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,655,32,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00242,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,657,517,i have been to see your mother s room,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00243,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,659,594,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00244,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,661,704,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00245,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,663,731,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00246,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,665,426,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00247,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,667,22,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00248,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,669,607,no,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
00249,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,671,582,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00250,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,673,519,but your father was he afflicted,and did isabella never change her mind before,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00251,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,675,609,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00252,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,679,664,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00253,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,681,417,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00254,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,683,660,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00255,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,685,723,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part,it will soon be as if you never had,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00256,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,687,282,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,you are not fond of the country,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00257,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,697,513,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant,bravo an excellent satire on modern language,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
00258,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,699,368,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before,me i take offence,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00259,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,701,623,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,and how might you learn by accident or argument,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00260,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,703,515,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00261,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,706,707,but he will tell only half of it,a quarter would be enough,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
00262,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,711,712,go away and why,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00263,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,713,676,oh not seriously,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00264,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,715,586,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00265,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,722,670,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00266,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,724,266,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself,that you think they cannot be compared together,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
00267,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,726,714,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00268,Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,728,698,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

00344,Isabella Thorpe,Catherine Morland,556,496,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits,Catherine Morland,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

00347,Isabella Thorpe,Catherine Morland,562,74,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last,oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world,Catherine Morland,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
