p00000_A,00000,A,But you will soon be in receipt of some Let us calculate We must translate these roubles into thalers Here take 100 thalers as a round sum The rest will be safe in my hands You must not be offended at what I say You are too touchy about these things What I have said I have said merely as a warning To do so is no more than my right
p00001_A,00001,A,Of course one always learns something everywhere
p00002_A,00002,A,Just so You must know that on one occasion when for two days I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris to have my passport visaed There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien After listening politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan asked me to wait a little I was in a great hurry to depart but of course I sat down pulled out a copy of L Opinion Nationale and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor took his leave I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increased dryness he again asked me to wait Soon a third visitor arrived who like myself had come on business he was an Austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs This made me very angry I rose approached the sacristan and told him that since Monsignor was receiving callers his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor s In a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me he looked me up and down and then said But I only cried the louder screeched the sacristan again shrinking back in horror Then rushing to the door he spread out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter
p00003_A,00003,A,But
p00004_A,00004,A,And even if you were to win much I should be compromised Of course I have no right to order your actions but you yourself will agree that
p00005_A,00005,A,Well absurd though it be I place great hopes on your playing of roulette wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal shares wherefore of course you will do as I wish
p00006_A,00006,A,Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised Westerner there has become historically added though this is not his chief point a capacity for acquiring capital whereas not only is the Russian incapable of acquiring capital but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly None the less we Russians often need money wherefore we are glad of and greatly devoted to a method of acquisition like roulette whereby in a couple of hours one may grow rich without doing any work This method I repeat has a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without taking any trouble we almost invariably lose
p00007_A,00007,A,To a certain extent that is true
p00008_A,00008,A,I beg pardon Yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing rich through honest toil
p00009_A,00009,A,What an extraordinary idea
p00010_A,00010,A,And what a Russian idea
p00011_A,00011,A,To the German method of heaping up riches I have not been here very long but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood boil Good Lord I wish for no virtues of that kind Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere I found that things were even as we read of them in good German picture books that every house has its Vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable So honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and I cannot bear people of that sort Each such Vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud Over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching Do not be angry General Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that I can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother Yes I know how things ought to be done Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its Vater They work like oxen and amass wealth like Jews Suppose the Vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land Well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded For the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital Yes such things ARE done for I have been making inquiries on the subject It is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge What more have I to tell Well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden So the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while Gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated Then the Vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous Vater and the old story begins again In fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original Vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild or a Hoppe and Company or the devil knows what Is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all What is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves Yes there you have it in a nutshell For my own part I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette I have no wish to be Hoppe and Company at the end of five generations I want the money for myself for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital I may be wrong but there you have it Those are my views
p00012_A,00012,A,How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know but I do know that you are becoming an insufferable far eur whenever you are given the least chance
p00013_A,00013,A,Sind Sie rasend
p00014_A,00014,A,Have you Then you can take the consequences
p00015_A,00015,A,General one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled I have not so much as begun my explanations to the Baron and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is to me a shameful supposition namely that I am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will It is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself
p00016_A,00016,A,For God s sake Alexis Ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours Do you know what is likely to come of it Merely further unpleasantness You will agree with me I am sure that at present I ought to move with especial care yes with very especial care You cannot be fully aware of how I am situated When we leave this place I shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time being I Well I cannot tell you all my reasons O Alexis Ivanovitch Alexis Ivanovitch move with especial care at present

p00067_A,00067,A,Why Why
p00068_A,00068,A,Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this to this how shall I express it to this old lady cette pauvre terrible vieille But she will only gamble away all that she has gamble it away like thistledown You yourself have seen her play Once she has acquired the taste for gambling she will never leave the roulette table but of sheer perversity and temper will stake her all and lose it In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn away from the game and then and then
p00069_A,00069,A,Refuse to take her about Simply leave her alone

p00084_A,00084,A,I mean only that I cannot come just yet At all events I could not well leave my little brother and sister here since since if I were to leave them they would be abandoned altogether But if Grandmamma you would take the little ones and myself then of course I could come with you and would do all I could to serve you Only without the little ones I cannot come
p00085_A,00085,A,But let me stay with you a little longer
p00086_A,00086,A,No you need not Do not bother me for you and all of them have tired me out

p00091_A,00091,A,You treated her as a gentleman should but he he robbed her right and left as I could see with my own eyes Twice she caught him at it and rated him soundly On one occasion she even pulled his hair so that the bystanders burst out laughing Yet she lost everything sir that is to say she lost all that you had changed for her Then we brought her home and after asking for some water and saying her prayers she went to bed So worn out was she that she fell asleep at once May God send her dreams of angels And this is all that foreign travel has done for us Oh my own Moscow For what have we not at home there in Moscow Such a garden and flowers as you could never see here and fresh air and apple trees coming into blossom and a beautiful view to look upon Ah but what must she do but go travelling abroad Alack alack
p00092_A,00092,A,the compliments of a certain person

p00098_A,00098,A,She is an ungrateful woman She is a bad and ungrateful woman She has broken up a family If there were laws here I would have her impaled Yes I would He has ruined me He has robbed me and cut my throat For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me For months at a time he never left me in my dreams Do not speak of him again
p00099_A,00099,A,I must behave altogether differently Yet mark you there is a tiresome circumstance of which I had never before thought which is how best to pronounce my new family name Zagorianski Zagozianski Madame la G n rale de Sago Madame la G n rale de Fourteen Consonants oh these infernal Russian names The last of them would be the best to use don t you think Tu tais bon enfant Je te croyais b te et tu en avais l air but it suited you Attends They may come in handy for you for though you are a very learned tutor you are a very stupid man More than two thousand francs however I am not going to give you for the reason that if I did so you would gamble them all away Now good bye Nous serons toujours bons amis and if you win again do not fail to come to me et tu seras heureux
p00000_B,00000,B,If one is a man of self respect one risks abuse by so doing and is forced to put up with insults of every kind Both at Paris and on the Rhine and even in Switzerland there are so many Poles with their sympathisers the French at these tables d h te that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian
p00001_B,00001,B,To spit into it
p00002_B,00002,B,What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian Cela n tait pas si b te
p00003_B,00003,B,But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated Why when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are Russians At all events at my hotel in Paris I received far more attention from the company after I had told them about the fracas with the sacristan A fat Polish nobleman who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te at once went upstairs while some of the Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man at whom in 1812 a French hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in Moscow
p00004_B,00004,B,Because I wish to play for myself That is my sole reason
p00005_B,00005,B,I really cannot say
p00006_B,00006,B,Oh no it is not true And you you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country
p00007_B,00007,B,I beg pardon Yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing rich through honest toil
p00008_B,00008,B,And what a Russian idea
p00009_B,00009,B,I would rather live a wandering life in tents than bow the knee to a German idol
p00010_B,00010,B,To what idol
p00011_B,00011,B,Because he is a brute
p00012_B,00012,B,Have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the General
p00013_B,00013,B,I have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy
p00014_B,00014,B,I should be glad if we could come straight to the point Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German
p00015_B,00015,B,I have come to see you on business nor will I seek to conceal from you the fact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the General Having small knowledge of the Russian tongue I lost most of what was said last night but the General has now explained matters and I must confess that
p00016_B,00016,B,See here Monsieur de Griers I understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary Of course I am only un utchitel a tutor and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it Consequently I do not know the whole of its circumstances Yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its members seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything and are now present as an intermediary
p00017_B,00017,B,And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after making her will Yet she will outlive us and every one else in the hotel Good Lord what is going to become of us now What on earth is to happen to the General She will turn the place upside down
