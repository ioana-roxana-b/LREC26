Sir Thomas,Lady Bertram,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone,6,0,1,0,14,1,1,1,9,1,1,1,5,2,1,1,10,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,17,5,1,1,13,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,121,19,7,9,Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris,M,intermediate,F,intermediate
Mrs. Norris,Sir Thomas,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct,2,8,1,1,7,13,1,1,3,9,1,1,2,8,1,1,7,4,1,1,0,2,0,1,9,19,1,1,4,18,1,1,1,0,1,0,47,134,8,10,Lady Bertram; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate
