p00000_A,00000,A,poor miss taylor i wish she were here again what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her
p00001_A,00001,A,i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own
p00002_A,00002,A,a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear
p00003_A,00003,A,how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon
p00004_A,00004,A,my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far
p00005_A,00005,A,no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure
p00006_A,00006,A,the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit
p00007_A,00007,A,they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you
p00008_A,00008,A,it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk
p00009_A,00009,A,not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire
p00010_A,00010,A,but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold
p00011_A,00011,A,dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them
p00012_A,00012,A,well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding
p00013_A,00013,A,by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most
p00014_A,00014,A,ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
p00015_A,00015,A,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two
p00016_A,00016,A,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by
p00017_A,00017,A,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00018_A,00018,A,my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another
p00019_A,00019,A,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00020_A,00020,A,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day
p00021_A,00021,A,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00022_A,00022,A,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00023_A,00023,A,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing
p00024_A,00024,A,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00025_A,00025,A,i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making
p00026_A,00026,A,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said
p00027_A,00027,A,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that
p00028_A,00028,A,a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
p00029_A,00029,A,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously
p00030_A,00030,A,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00031_A,00031,A,mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him
p00032_A,00032,A,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00033_A,00033,A,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you
p00034_A,00034,A,two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people
p00035_A,00035,A,and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her
p00036_A,00036,A,mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read
p00037_A,00037,A,oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can
p00038_A,00038,A,what sort of looking man is mr martin
p00039_A,00039,A,oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often
p00040_A,00040,A,that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it
p00041_A,00041,A,to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight
p00042_A,00042,A,i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be
p00043_A,00043,A,he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd
p00044_A,00044,A,only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable
p00045_A,00045,A,six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old
p00046_A,00046,A,well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet
p00047_A,00047,A,to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year
p00048_A,00048,A,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you
p00049_A,00049,A,yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do
p00050_A,00050,A,you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education
p00051_A,00051,A,to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain
p00052_A,00052,A,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility
p00053_A,00053,A,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen
p00054_A,00054,A,i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here
p00055_A,00055,A,certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man
p00056_A,00056,A,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference
p00057_A,00057,A,oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty
p00058_A,00058,A,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life
p00059_A,00059,A,there is no saying indeed
p00060_A,00060,A,but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss
p00061_A,00061,A,will he indeed that will be very bad
p00062_A,00062,A,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us
p00063_A,00063,A,i wonder he did not remember the book
p00064_A,00064,A,i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing
p00065_A,00065,A,a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so
p00066_A,00066,A,i think they will neither of them do the other any good
p00067_A,00067,A,you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley
p00068_A,00068,A,perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle
p00069_A,00069,A,mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know
p00070_A,00070,A,emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you could not
p00071_A,00071,A,i dare say that i thought so then but since we have parted i can never remember emma s omitting to do any thing i wished
p00072_A,00072,A,there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that but i who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her
p00073_A,00073,A,i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held
p00074_A,00074,A,yes you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor
p00075_A,00075,A,thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston
p00076_A,00076,A,why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him
p00077_A,00077,A,i hope not that it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter
p00078_A,00078,A,not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life they only give a little polish
p00079_A,00079,A,i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night
p00080_A,00080,A,oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty
p00081_A,00081,A,pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure
p00082_A,00082,A,i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend
p00083_A,00083,A,such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she
p00084_A,00084,A,i have not a fault to find with her person i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm
p00085_A,00085,A,and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times
p00086_A,00086,A,very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me
p00087_A,00087,A,i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office
p00088_A,00088,A,not at all i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to
p00089_A,00089,A,mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister
p00090_A,00090,A,be satisfied i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her
p00091_A,00091,A,so do i very much
p00092_A,00092,A,she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home
p00093_A,00093,A,there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you
p00094_A,00094,A,you have given miss smith all that she required you have made her graceful and easy she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature
p00095_A,00095,A,i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little
p00096_A,00096,A,if it were admissible to contradict a lady
p00097_A,00097,A,i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before
p00098_A,00098,A,exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand
p00099_A,00099,A,great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable
p00100_A,00100,A,i have no doubt of it
p00101_A,00101,A,did you ever have your likeness taken harriet did you ever sit for your picture
p00102_A,00102,A,oh dear no never
p00103_A,00103,A,what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture
p00104_A,00104,A,let me entreat you it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls
p00105_A,00105,A,well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch
p00106_A,00106,A,exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession
p00107_A,00107,A,but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn
p00108_A,00108,A,oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded
p00109_A,00109,A,no great variety of faces for you i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that s very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side yes it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now
p00110_A,00110,A,no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives
p00111_A,00111,A,miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not
p00112_A,00112,A,do you think so i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know
p00113_A,00113,A,you have made her too tall emma
p00114_A,00114,A,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed
p00115_A,00115,A,it is very pretty so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold
p00116_A,00116,A,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00117_A,00117,A,but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear
p00118_A,00118,A,what a precious deposit
p00119_A,00119,A,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can
p00120_A,00120,A,will you read the letter pray do i d rather you would well well is it a good letter or is it too short
p00121_A,00121,A,yes indeed a very good letter so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet than i had expected
p00122_A,00122,A,well well and and what shall i do
p00123_A,00123,A,but what are you in doubt of you must answer it of course and speedily
p00124_A,00124,A,yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me
p00125_A,00125,A,oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment
p00126_A,00126,A,you think i ought to refuse him then
p00127_A,00127,A,ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it you mean to return a favourable answer i collect
p00128_A,00128,A,no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do
p00129_A,00129,A,i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings
p00130_A,00130,A,i had no notion that he liked me so very much
p00131_A,00131,A,i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you
p00132_A,00132,A,oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no
p00133_A,00133,A,not for the world would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of
p00134_A,00134,A,miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right
p00135_A,00135,A,perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever
p00136_A,00136,A,you could not have visited me no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world
p00137_A,00137,A,indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up
p00138_A,00138,A,dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more
p00139_A,00139,A,dear affectionate creature you banished to abbey mill farm you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself
p00140_A,00140,A,i do not think he is conceited either in general at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration
p00141_A,00141,A,thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter
p00142_A,00142,A,oh no and it is but a short letter too oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say i shall never be invited to abbey mill again
p00143_A,00143,A,nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill
p00144_A,00144,A,and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper
p00145_A,00145,A,one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves
p00146_A,00146,A,now he has got my letter i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much
p00147_A,00147,A,let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name
p00148_A,00148,A,my picture but he has left my picture in bond street
p00149_A,00149,A,well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emma s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can i treat you without ceremony mr knightley we invalids think we are privileged people
p00150_A,00150,A,my dear sir do not make a stranger of me
p00151_A,00151,A,i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk
p00152_A,00152,A,you cannot do better sir
p00153_A,00153,A,i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey
p00154_A,00154,A,i cannot rate her beauty as you do but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman
p00155_A,00155,A,i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting
p00156_A,00156,A,come you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit
p00157_A,00157,A,thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it
p00158_A,00158,A,you are expecting her again you say this morning
p00159_A,00159,A,almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended
p00160_A,00160,A,something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps
p00161_A,00161,A,highbury gossips tiresome wretches
p00162_A,00162,A,harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage
p00163_A,00163,A,indeed how so of what sort
p00164_A,00164,A,a very serious sort i assure you
p00165_A,00165,A,very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant
p00166_A,00166,A,i have reason to think that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her
p00167_A,00167,A,he is very obliging but is he sure that harriet means to marry him
p00168_A,00168,A,well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch
p00169_A,00169,A,pray mr knightley how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday
p00170_A,00170,A,certainly i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you
p00171_A,00171,A,come i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused
p00172_A,00172,A,then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about
p00173_A,00173,A,oh to be sure it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her
p00174_A,00174,A,nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken
p00175_A,00175,A,i saw her answer nothing could be clearer
p00176_A,00176,A,you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him
p00177_A,00177,A,and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over
p00178_A,00178,A,not harriet s equal no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match
p00179_A,00179,A,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation
p00180_A,00180,A,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer
p00181_A,00181,A,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin
p00182_A,00182,A,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement
p00183_A,00183,A,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess
p00184_A,00184,A,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do
p00185_A,00185,A,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her
p00186_A,00186,A,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son
p00187_A,00187,A,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet
p00188_A,00188,A,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece
p00189_A,00189,A,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well
p00190_A,00190,A,good morning to you
p00191_A,00191,A,why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you
p00192_A,00192,A,i do not offer it for miss smith s collection being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it
p00193_A,00193,A,what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman can it be neptune or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out
p00194_A,00194,A,mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen for miss read miss smith that is court that is ship plain as it can be now for the cream courtship you know a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us
p00195_A,00195,A,dear miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse whatever you say is always right and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me
p00196_A,00196,A,i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose
p00197_A,00197,A,it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place
p00198_A,00198,A,when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage
p00199_A,00199,A,that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole
p00200_A,00200,A,this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them
p00201_A,00201,A,yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it
p00202_A,00202,A,i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday
p00203_A,00203,A,i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read
p00204_A,00204,A,i never read one more to the purpose certainly
p00205_A,00205,A,it is as long again as almost all we have had before
p00206_A,00206,A,i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short
p00207_A,00207,A,it is one thing to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this such sweet lines these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that
p00208_A,00208,A,leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me
p00209_A,00209,A,oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good
p00210_A,00210,A,leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book
p00211_A,00211,A,oh but those two lines are
p00212_A,00212,A,the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you
p00213_A,00213,A,i shall never let that book go out of my own hands
p00214_A,00214,A,very well a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade
p00215_A,00215,A,well my dears how does your book go on have you got any thing fresh
p00216_A,00216,A,yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in
p00217_A,00217,A,aye that s very just indeed that s very properly said very true it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody could have written so prettily but you emma ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it
p00218_A,00218,A,yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know
p00219_A,00219,A,aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children
p00220_A,00220,A,oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know why should there be any change
p00221_A,00221,A,i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here
p00222_A,00222,A,she will not be surprized papa at least
p00223_A,00223,A,i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married
p00224_A,00224,A,we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here
p00225_A,00225,A,yes my dear if there is time but she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing
p00226_A,00226,A,it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us
p00227_A,00227,A,it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well
p00228_A,00228,A,ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john
p00229_A,00229,A,aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet
p00230_A,00230,A,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00231_A,00231,A,henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often
p00232_A,00232,A,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him
p00233_A,00233,A,and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way
p00234_A,00234,A,but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other
p00235_A,00235,A,well i cannot understand it
p00236_A,00236,A,oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry
p00237_A,00237,A,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life
p00238_A,00238,A,there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days
p00239_A,00239,A,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much
p00240_A,00240,A,i do not often walk this way now but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury i wish we could contrive it but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father
p00241_A,00241,A,i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are
p00242_A,00242,A,my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all
p00243_A,00243,A,ah so you say but i cannot believe it
p00244_A,00244,A,i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it
p00245_A,00245,A,dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so
p00246_A,00246,A,i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s
p00247_A,00247,A,but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates
p00248_A,00248,A,that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried
p00249_A,00249,A,but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful
p00250_A,00250,A,never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm
p00251_A,00251,A,dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old
p00252_A,00252,A,if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me
p00253_A,00253,A,do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted
p00254_A,00254,A,oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind
p00255_A,00255,A,very true poor creatures one can think of nothing else
p00256_A,00256,A,and really i do not think the impression will soon be over i do not think it will
p00257_A,00257,A,oh dear no
p00258_A,00258,A,ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves
p00259_A,00259,A,oh dear yes
p00260_A,00260,A,ah my dear poor miss taylor it is a grievous business
p00261_A,00261,A,oh yes sir how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir
p00262_A,00262,A,pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably
p00263_A,00263,A,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00264_A,00264,A,very much to the honour of both
p00265_A,00265,A,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00266_A,00266,A,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00267_A,00267,A,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00268_A,00268,A,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00269_A,00269,A,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00270_A,00270,A,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00271_A,00271,A,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can
p00272_A,00272,A,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00273_A,00273,A,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not
p00274_A,00274,A,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately
p00275_A,00275,A,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps
p00276_A,00276,A,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes
p00277_A,00277,A,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly
p00278_A,00278,A,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00279_A,00279,A,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords
p00280_A,00280,A,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree
p00281_A,00281,A,if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike
p00282_A,00282,A,to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong
p00283_A,00283,A,yes and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born
p00284_A,00284,A,a material difference then and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer
p00285_A,00285,A,yes a good deal nearer
p00286_A,00286,A,but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently
p00287_A,00287,A,i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now
p00288_A,00288,A,that s true very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed
p00289_A,00289,A,a man cannot be more so
p00290_A,00290,A,how d ye do george
p00291_A,00291,A,my poor dear isabella how long it is how terribly long since you were here and how tired you must be after your journey you must go to bed early my dear and i recommend a little gruel to you before you go you and i will have a nice basin of gruel together my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here i never had much opinion of the sea air
p00292_A,00292,A,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing
p00293_A,00293,A,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once
p00294_A,00294,A,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00295_A,00295,A,oh good mr perry how is he sir
p00296_A,00296,A,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where
p00297_A,00297,A,and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones
p00298_A,00298,A,i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella s throat
p00299_A,00299,A,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august
p00300_A,00300,A,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to
p00301_A,00301,A,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00302_A,00302,A,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir
p00303_A,00303,A,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago
p00304_A,00304,A,how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza
p00305_A,00305,A,that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season
p00306_A,00306,A,no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except
p00307_A,00307,A,ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad
p00308_A,00308,A,no indeed we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air
p00309_A,00309,A,ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present
p00310_A,00310,A,i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill
p00311_A,00311,A,what is the matter sir did you speak to me
p00312_A,00312,A,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00313_A,00313,A,my dear isabella pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse
p00314_A,00314,A,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00315_A,00315,A,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma
p00316_A,00316,A,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet
p00317_A,00317,A,i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age
p00318_A,00318,A,ah i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here
p00319_A,00319,A,but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good
p00320_A,00320,A,and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end
p00321_A,00321,A,i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly
p00322_A,00322,A,you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable you should have consulted perry
p00323_A,00323,A,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty
p00324_A,00324,A,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure
p00325_A,00325,A,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself
p00326_A,00326,A,a sore throat i hope not infectious i hope not of a putrid infectious sort has perry seen her indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend let me entreat you to run no risks why does not perry see her
p00327_A,00327,A,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night
p00328_A,00328,A,very cold certainly very cold
p00329_A,00329,A,i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works
p00330_A,00330,A,mr elton s manners are not perfect but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value
p00331_A,00331,A,yes he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you
p00332_A,00332,A,me are you imagining me to be mr elton s object
p00333_A,00333,A,such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now
p00334_A,00334,A,mr elton in love with me what an idea
p00335_A,00335,A,i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do
p00336_A,00336,A,i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more
p00337_A,00337,A,a man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home
p00338_A,00338,A,my report from mrs goddard s was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was my answer
p00339_A,00339,A,oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning
p00340_A,00340,A,my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard
p00341_A,00341,A,yes i imagined that is i did not
p00342_A,00342,A,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day
p00343_A,00343,A,dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment what an excellent device the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see
p00344_A,00344,A,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it
p00345_A,00345,A,christmas weather quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight
p00346_A,00346,A,i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls
p00347_A,00347,A,we are sure of excellent fires and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings
p00348_A,00348,A,i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine with any body
p00349_A,00349,A,indeed i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment
p00350_A,00350,A,my first enjoyment will be to find myself safe at hartfield again
p00351_A,00351,A,we want only two more to be just the right number i should like to see two more here your pretty little friend miss smith and my son and then i should say we were quite complete i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing room that we are expecting frank i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight he has been wanting to come to us ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january
p00352_A,00352,A,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself
p00353_A,00353,A,yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing
p00354_A,00354,A,i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe
p00355_A,00355,A,for i cannot depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands
p00356_A,00356,A,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00357_A,00357,A,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him
p00358_A,00358,A,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them
p00359_A,00359,A,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better
p00360_A,00360,A,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine
p00361_A,00361,A,he ought to come if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it
p00362_A,00362,A,one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her
p00363_A,00363,A,but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all
p00364_A,00364,A,my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be
p00365_A,00365,A,i shall not be satisfied unless he comes
p00366_A,00366,A,i admired your resolution very much sir in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight
p00367_A,00367,A,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00368_A,00368,A,you had better order the carriage directly my love i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold
p00369_A,00369,A,your father will not be easy why do not you go
p00370_A,00370,A,i am ready if the others are
p00371_A,00371,A,shall i ring the bell
p00372_A,00372,A,i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please
p00373_A,00373,A,miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean
p00374_A,00374,A,mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions
p00375_A,00375,A,good heaven what can be the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no i am sure you have seen and understood me charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me
p00376_A,00376,A,no sir it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought seriously of her
p00377_A,00377,A,never madam never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received
p00378_A,00378,A,ah mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton
p00379_A,00379,A,the churchills are very likely in fault but i dare say he might come if he would
p00380_A,00380,A,i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him
p00381_A,00381,A,i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof
p00382_A,00382,A,how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature
p00383_A,00383,A,i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible
p00384_A,00384,A,that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage
p00385_A,00385,A,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills
p00386_A,00386,A,yes sometimes he can
p00387_A,00387,A,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure
p00388_A,00388,A,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others
p00389_A,00389,A,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going
p00390_A,00390,A,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable
p00391_A,00391,A,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his
p00392_A,00392,A,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it
p00393_A,00393,A,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction
p00394_A,00394,A,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life
p00395_A,00395,A,our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now
p00396_A,00396,A,we shall never agree about him but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others
p00397_A,00397,A,yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me
p00398_A,00398,A,your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else
p00399_A,00399,A,i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him
p00400_A,00400,A,you seem determined to think ill of him
p00401_A,00401,A,me not at all i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners
p00402_A,00402,A,well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else
p00403_A,00403,A,you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts
p00404_A,00404,A,my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him
p00405_A,00405,A,and mine is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point
p00406_A,00406,A,i will say no more about him you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here
p00407_A,00407,A,prejudiced i am not prejudiced
p00408_A,00408,A,but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour
p00409_A,00409,A,oh yes mr elton i understand certainly as to dancing mrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was mrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can and so she began inquiring after her directly saying and when i immediately said i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized said she
p00410_A,00410,A,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00411_A,00411,A,my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now
p00412_A,00412,A,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon
p00413_A,00413,A,oh yes next week
p00414_A,00414,A,indeed that must be a very great pleasure
p00415_A,00415,A,thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday
p00416_A,00416,A,yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day
p00417_A,00417,A,so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things
p00418_A,00418,A,you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell
p00419_A,00419,A,very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon
p00420_A,00420,A,but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates
p00421_A,00421,A,yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately
p00422_A,00422,A,i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax
p00423_A,00423,A,oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable
p00424_A,00424,A,yes that of course
p00425_A,00425,A,jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do
p00426_A,00426,A,it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world
p00427_A,00427,A,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her
p00428_A,00428,A,she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome
p00429_A,00429,A,a very pleasant evening particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence
p00430_A,00430,A,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield
p00431_A,00431,A,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00432_A,00432,A,no you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore
p00433_A,00433,A,miss fairfax is reserved
p00434_A,00434,A,i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured
p00435_A,00435,A,you think her diffident i do not see it
p00436_A,00436,A,my dear emma you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening
p00437_A,00437,A,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained
p00438_A,00438,A,i am disappointed
p00439_A,00439,A,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00440_A,00440,A,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax
p00441_A,00441,A,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart
p00442_A,00442,A,it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear
p00443_A,00443,A,my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like
p00444_A,00444,A,that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome
p00445_A,00445,A,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you
p00446_A,00446,A,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls
p00447_A,00447,A,oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be married
p00448_A,00448,A,there is my news i thought it would interest you
p00449_A,00449,A,but where could you hear it where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins that s all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins
p00450_A,00450,A,i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly
p00451_A,00451,A,well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her
p00452_A,00452,A,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00453_A,00453,A,oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well
p00454_A,00454,A,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00455_A,00455,A,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00456_A,00456,A,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00457_A,00457,A,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00458_A,00458,A,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00459_A,00459,A,who shall answer that question my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind
p00460_A,00460,A,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00461_A,00461,A,as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins
p00462_A,00462,A,when i have seen mr elton i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off
p00463_A,00463,A,yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative
p00464_A,00464,A,quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all
p00465_A,00465,A,very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome
p00466_A,00466,A,handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he was plain
p00467_A,00467,A,my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself
p00468_A,00468,A,oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain
p00469_A,00469,A,oh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened dear miss woodhouse only think i thought i should have fainted i did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answered and i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one can t tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr cole s stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly and elizabeth too oh miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again
p00470_A,00470,A,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it
p00471_A,00471,A,very true would not think about it
p00472_A,00472,A,how d ye do how d ye do we have been sitting with your father glad to see him so well frank comes to morrow i had a letter this morning we see him to morrow by dinner time to a certainty he is at oxford to day and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish i shall soon bring him over to hartfield
p00473_A,00473,A,we had better move on mr weston we are detaining the girls
p00474_A,00474,A,well well i am ready but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary
p00475_A,00475,A,think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock
p00476_A,00476,A,four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three
p00477_A,00477,A,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford
p00478_A,00478,A,i told you yesterday i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs
p00479_A,00479,A,elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston
p00480_A,00480,A,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00481_A,00481,A,as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name
p00482_A,00482,A,to be sure we do mrs bates we passed her house i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means
p00483_A,00483,A,there is no necessity for my calling this morning another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which
p00484_A,00484,A,oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight
p00485_A,00485,A,if you were never particularly struck by her manners before i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue
p00486_A,00486,A,you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way
p00487_A,00487,A,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00488_A,00488,A,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street
p00489_A,00489,A,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00490_A,00490,A,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before
p00491_A,00491,A,and how did you think miss fairfax looking
p00492_A,00492,A,ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion
p00493_A,00493,A,it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face well there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion
p00494_A,00494,A,i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion
p00495_A,00495,A,did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society
p00496_A,00496,A,ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves
p00497_A,00497,A,oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues
p00498_A,00498,A,but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life
p00499_A,00499,A,i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth
p00500_A,00500,A,and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow
p00501_A,00501,A,upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her
p00502_A,00502,A,may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all
p00503_A,00503,A,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be
p00504_A,00504,A,yes i believe i do
p00505_A,00505,A,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00506_A,00506,A,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend
p00507_A,00507,A,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play
p00508_A,00508,A,ever hear her you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly
p00509_A,00509,A,you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof
p00510_A,00510,A,proof indeed mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year
p00511_A,00511,A,yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof
p00512_A,00512,A,certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it
p00513_A,00513,A,it was her very particular friend you know
p00514_A,00514,A,poor comfort one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland
p00515_A,00515,A,you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it
p00516_A,00516,A,so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction
p00517_A,00517,A,as to that i do not
p00518_A,00518,A,oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses
p00519_A,00519,A,there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be
p00520_A,00520,A,i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved
p00521_A,00521,A,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person
p00522_A,00522,A,not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal
p00523_A,00523,A,i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out
p00524_A,00524,A,of course it must be declined
p00525_A,00525,A,i am not fond of dinner visiting i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me
p00526_A,00526,A,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00527_A,00527,A,you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over
p00528_A,00528,A,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00529_A,00529,A,oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise
p00530_A,00530,A,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party
p00531_A,00531,A,and no great harm if it does the sooner every party breaks up the better
p00532_A,00532,A,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years
p00533_A,00533,A,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends
p00534_A,00534,A,this is coming as you should do like a gentleman i am quite glad to see you
p00535_A,00535,A,how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner
p00536_A,00536,A,yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances now you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you
p00537_A,00537,A,one can suppose nothing else and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening
p00538_A,00538,A,why do you smile
p00539_A,00539,A,nay why do you
p00540_A,00540,A,i rather wonder that it was never made before
p00541_A,00541,A,perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before
p00542_A,00542,A,or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body
p00543_A,00543,A,that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house
p00544_A,00544,A,you may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine
p00545_A,00545,A,i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be
p00546_A,00546,A,what do you say to mrs dixon
p00547_A,00547,A,mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine
p00548_A,00548,A,if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon in them
p00549_A,00549,A,mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance
p00550_A,00550,A,yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are
p00551_A,00551,A,and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided
p00552_A,00552,A,and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her
p00553_A,00553,A,he did i was there one of the party
p00554_A,00554,A,were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries
p00555_A,00555,A,i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries
p00556_A,00556,A,the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon
p00557_A,00557,A,and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells
p00558_A,00558,A,no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business
p00559_A,00559,A,indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love i have made a most wretched discovery i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection
p00560_A,00560,A,perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut
p00561_A,00561,A,no that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen
p00562_A,00562,A,what is the matter
p00563_A,00563,A,this is the luxury of a large party one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i am longing to talk to you i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh do you know how miss bates and her niece came here
p00564_A,00564,A,how they were invited were not they
p00565_A,00565,A,oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming
p00566_A,00566,A,they walked i conclude how else could they come
p00567_A,00567,A,very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them
p00568_A,00568,A,very likely nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray
p00569_A,00569,A,well you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it
p00570_A,00570,A,mr knightley and jane fairfax dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing
p00571_A,00571,A,my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter
p00572_A,00572,A,yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women
p00573_A,00573,A,nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know
p00574_A,00574,A,but the imprudence of such a match
p00575_A,00575,A,i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability
p00576_A,00576,A,i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing
p00577_A,00577,A,imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable
p00578_A,00578,A,but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart
p00579_A,00579,A,my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax
p00580_A,00580,A,nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but
p00581_A,00581,A,well perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home
p00582_A,00582,A,if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong
p00583_A,00583,A,for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love
p00584_A,00584,A,then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously
p00585_A,00585,A,i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him
p00586_A,00586,A,very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so
p00587_A,00587,A,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner
p00588_A,00588,A,i often feel concern that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose
p00589_A,00589,A,quite out of the question quite out of the question but you must often wish it i am sure
p00590_A,00590,A,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given
p00591_A,00591,A,that will do you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet
p00592_A,00592,A,i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second
p00593_A,00593,A,oh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax
p00594_A,00594,A,don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine
p00595_A,00595,A,oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played
p00596_A,00596,A,those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it
p00597_A,00597,A,well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution
p00598_A,00598,A,ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet
p00599_A,00599,A,are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked
p00600_A,00600,A,just as they always do very vulgar
p00601_A,00601,A,they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer
p00602_A,00602,A,she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be
p00603_A,00603,A,she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him
p00604_A,00604,A,for my companion tells me that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning i was not aware of it myself i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now
p00605_A,00605,A,and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home
p00606_A,00606,A,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased
p00607_A,00607,A,me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do
p00608_A,00608,A,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument
p00609_A,00609,A,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood
p00610_A,00610,A,i do not believe any such thing i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night
p00611_A,00611,A,should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am
p00612_A,00612,A,yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you
p00613_A,00613,A,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00614_A,00614,A,no more it is
p00615_A,00615,A,no trouble in the world ma am
p00616_A,00616,A,oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise
p00617_A,00617,A,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford
p00618_A,00618,A,my dear miss woodhouse i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith how do you do miss smith very well i thank you and i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding
p00619_A,00619,A,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00620_A,00620,A,this is a pleasure coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed
p00621_A,00621,A,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00622_A,00622,A,i have not been working uninterruptedly i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home whoever colonel campbell might employ the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so
p00623_A,00623,A,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her
p00624_A,00624,A,how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences
p00625_A,00625,A,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture
p00626_A,00626,A,conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam of restoring your spectacles healed for the present if you are very kind it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it
p00627_A,00627,A,you speak too plain she must understand you
p00628_A,00628,A,i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning
p00629_A,00629,A,but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea
p00630_A,00630,A,i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her if she does wrong she ought to feel it
p00631_A,00631,A,she is not entirely without it i think
p00632_A,00632,A,how d ye do how d ye do very well i thank you so obliged to you for the carriage last night we were just in time my mother just ready for us pray come in do come in you will find some friends here
p00633_A,00633,A,how is your niece miss bates i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax i hope she caught no cold last night how is she to day tell me how miss fairfax is
p00634_A,00634,A,so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage
p00635_A,00635,A,i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you
p00636_A,00636,A,oh dear kingston are you mrs cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston
p00637_A,00637,A,mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for you
p00638_A,00638,A,no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in
p00639_A,00639,A,well for five minutes perhaps
p00640_A,00640,A,and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too quite delightful so many friends
p00641_A,00641,A,no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes i must get on to kingston as fast as i can
p00642_A,00642,A,oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you
p00643_A,00643,A,no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte
p00644_A,00644,A,well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant did you ever see such dancing was not it delightful miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it
p00645_A,00645,A,oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes and i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best country dance player without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it
p00646_A,00646,A,oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked jane and i are both so shocked about the apples
p00647_A,00647,A,what is the matter now
p00648_A,00648,A,i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing
p00649_A,00649,A,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing
p00650_A,00650,A,oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very obliging of you
p00651_A,00651,A,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00652_A,00652,A,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well
p00653_A,00653,A,it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in
p00654_A,00654,A,very true it was very bad i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple
p00655_A,00655,A,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room
p00656_A,00656,A,well miss woodhouse your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn
p00657_A,00657,A,the crown
p00658_A,00658,A,yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent
p00659_A,00659,A,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement
p00660_A,00660,A,i was going to observe sir that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could
p00661_A,00661,A,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house
p00662_A,00662,A,from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief
p00663_A,00663,A,open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it
p00664_A,00664,A,ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself
p00665_A,00665,A,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done
p00666_A,00666,A,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited
p00667_A,00667,A,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00668_A,00668,A,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00669_A,00669,A,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00670_A,00670,A,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00671_A,00671,A,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry
p00672_A,00672,A,emma this paper is worse than i expected look in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined
p00673_A,00673,A,my dear you are too particular what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club nights
p00674_A,00674,A,i do not think it is so very small we shall not be many you know
p00675_A,00675,A,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs
p00676_A,00676,A,i wish one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be
p00677_A,00677,A,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00678_A,00678,A,well if you please if you think she will be of any use
p00679_A,00679,A,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates
p00680_A,00680,A,aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties fetch miss bates we are growing a little too nice she is a standing lesson of how to be happy but fetch them both invite them both
p00681_A,00681,A,both sir can the old lady
p00682_A,00682,A,the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece
p00683_A,00683,A,oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both
p00684_A,00684,A,of all horrid things leave taking is the worst
p00685_A,00685,A,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls
p00686_A,00686,A,ah the uncertainty of when i may be able to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever
p00687_A,00687,A,our poor ball must be quite given up
p00688_A,00688,A,ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right
p00689_A,00689,A,indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise
p00690_A,00690,A,if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement such a fortnight as it has been every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury
p00691_A,00691,A,as you do us such ample justice now i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury and you must be off this very morning
p00692_A,00692,A,yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him
p00693_A,00693,A,not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours
p00694_A,00694,A,yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then in short perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion
p00695_A,00695,A,you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then
p00696_A,00696,A,it was time to go
p00697_A,00697,A,i shall hear about you all that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again
p00698_A,00698,A,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck
p00699_A,00699,A,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me
p00700_A,00700,A,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been
p00701_A,00701,A,well miss woodhouse well miss woodhouse what do you think of her is not she very charming
p00702_A,00702,A,oh yes very a very pleasing young woman
p00703_A,00703,A,i think her beautiful quite beautiful
p00704_A,00704,A,very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown
p00705_A,00705,A,i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love
p00706_A,00706,A,oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way
p00707_A,00707,A,i dare say i dare say she was very much attached to him
p00708_A,00708,A,perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have
p00709_A,00709,A,my brother mr suckling s seat and the staircase you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house i really could not help exclaiming i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove i have spent so many happy months there a charming place undoubtedly every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony so extremely like maple grove and it is not merely the house the grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same way just across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style
p00710_A,00710,A,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties
p00711_A,00711,A,oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england
p00712_A,00712,A,yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry
p00713_A,00713,A,no i fancy not i never heard any county but surry called so my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer
p00714_A,00714,A,no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure
p00715_A,00715,A,ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good
p00716_A,00716,A,my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now
p00717_A,00717,A,ah that s a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with
p00718_A,00718,A,i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer
p00719_A,00719,A,oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments said i
p00720_A,00720,A,we cannot suppose that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive
p00721_A,00721,A,no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music
p00722_A,00722,A,but you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely
p00723_A,00723,A,i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper
p00724_A,00724,A,but every thing of that kind will soon be in so regular a train
p00725_A,00725,A,well we shall see we have been calling at randalls and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and she appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman
p00726_A,00726,A,mrs weston s manners were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman
p00727_A,00727,A,and who do you think came in while we were there knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man
p00728_A,00728,A,well my dear considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane
p00729_A,00729,A,i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you
p00730_A,00730,A,yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient
p00731_A,00731,A,but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them
p00732_A,00732,A,no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may
p00733_A,00733,A,well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies
p00734_A,00734,A,my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry
p00735_A,00735,A,jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhouse i quite rave about jane fairfax a sweet interesting creature so mild and ladylike and with such talents i assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth but upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax and her situation is so calculated to affect one miss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her we must bring her forward such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown i dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax
p00736_A,00736,A,i cannot think there is any danger of it and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown
p00737_A,00737,A,oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express
p00738_A,00738,A,you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than
p00739_A,00739,A,my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties
p00740_A,00740,A,we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to
p00741_A,00741,A,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her
p00742_A,00742,A,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00743_A,00743,A,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00744_A,00744,A,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness
p00745_A,00745,A,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax
p00746_A,00746,A,yes any body may know how highly i think of her
p00747_A,00747,A,and yet and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other
p00748_A,00748,A,oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her
p00749_A,00749,A,you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you
p00750_A,00750,A,so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax
p00751_A,00751,A,no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married
p00752_A,00752,A,no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife
p00753_A,00753,A,well and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose
p00754_A,00754,A,yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours
p00755_A,00755,A,in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau
p00756_A,00756,A,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond
p00757_A,00757,A,well mrs weston what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax
p00758_A,00758,A,i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wet we scarcely got home in time i hope you turned directly
p00759_A,00759,A,i went only to the post office and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good
p00760_A,00760,A,not a walk in the rain i should imagine
p00761_A,00761,A,no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out
p00762_A,00762,A,that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for
p00763_A,00763,A,i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters
p00764_A,00764,A,indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse
p00765_A,00765,A,you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship
p00766_A,00766,A,i have often thought them the worst of the two business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does
p00767_A,00767,A,ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day
p00768_A,00768,A,i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain young ladies should take care of themselves young ladies are delicate plants they should take care of their health and their complexion my dear did you change your stockings
p00769_A,00769,A,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me
p00770_A,00770,A,oh do not tell me you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourself to the post office indeed mrs weston did you ever hear the like you and i must positively exert our authority
p00771_A,00771,A,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again
p00772_A,00772,A,oh she shall not do such a thing again we will not allow her to do such a thing again there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation
p00773_A,00773,A,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before
p00774_A,00774,A,my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled
p00775_A,00775,A,excuse me i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama s
p00776_A,00776,A,oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness to employ our men
p00777_A,00777,A,the post office is a wonderful establishment the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing
p00778_A,00778,A,it is certainly very well regulated
p00779_A,00779,A,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder
p00780_A,00780,A,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart
p00781_A,00781,A,yes there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest
p00782_A,00782,A,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00783_A,00783,A,i never saw any gentleman s handwriting mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw
p00784_A,00784,A,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00785_A,00785,A,if we were in the other room if i had my writing desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day
p00786_A,00786,A,he chose to say he was employed
p00787_A,00787,A,well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley
p00788_A,00788,A,here is april come i get quite anxious about you june will soon be here
p00789_A,00789,A,but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general
p00790_A,00790,A,but have you really heard of nothing
p00791_A,00791,A,i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet
p00792_A,00792,A,oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing
p00793_A,00793,A,i not aware dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done
p00794_A,00794,A,but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in
p00795_A,00795,A,colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present
p00796_A,00796,A,trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible
p00797_A,00797,A,thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble
p00798_A,00798,A,but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly
p00799_A,00799,A,excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect
p00800_A,00800,A,oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition
p00801_A,00801,A,i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do
p00802_A,00802,A,something that would do aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life
p00803_A,00803,A,you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for
p00804_A,00804,A,i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest
p00805_A,00805,A,you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am
p00806_A,00806,A,i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name
p00807_A,00807,A,oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage
p00808_A,00808,A,you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter
p00809_A,00809,A,and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you
p00810_A,00810,A,aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time
p00811_A,00811,A,indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire
p00812_A,00812,A,yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey
p00813_A,00813,A,yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses
p00814_A,00814,A,the evil of the distance from enscombe is that mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that
p00815_A,00815,A,no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same
p00816_A,00816,A,depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for
p00817_A,00817,A,oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea
p00818_A,00818,A,is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill s illness
p00819_A,00819,A,if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath or to clifton
p00820_A,00820,A,she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired
p00821_A,00821,A,aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society
p00822_A,00822,A,frank was here in february for a fortnight
p00823_A,00823,A,so i remember to have heard he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world
p00824_A,00824,A,my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton when frank left us it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next
p00825_A,00825,A,very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair
p00826_A,00826,A,you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him
p00827_A,00827,A,and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer
p00828_A,00828,A,i hope i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart
p00829_A,00829,A,well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sister s letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure my charge would be much more concise than her s and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them
p00830_A,00830,A,i rather hope to satisfy you both for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic
p00831_A,00831,A,and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again
p00832_A,00832,A,that is very likely you think so do not you
p00833_A,00833,A,certainly you must be sensible that the last half year has made a great difference in your way of life
p00834_A,00834,A,difference no indeed i am not
p00835_A,00835,A,there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great
p00836_A,00836,A,yes it is randalls that does it all
p00837_A,00837,A,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home
p00838_A,00838,A,no that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure
p00839_A,00839,A,i think she must be here soon i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her it cannot be long i think before she comes i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her i have never seen either mr or mrs elton i have no business to put myself forward

p00849_A,00849,A,most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me
p00850_A,00850,A,me oh no i would get you a better partner than myself i am no dancer
p00851_A,00851,A,if mrs gilbert wishes to dance i shall have great pleasure i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert
p00852_A,00852,A,mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith
p00853_A,00853,A,jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners said i my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where i sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning
p00854_A,00854,A,they aimed at wounding more than harriet emma why is it that they are your enemies she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet
p00855_A,00855,A,i did and they cannot forgive me
p00856_A,00856,A,i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections
p00857_A,00857,A,can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong
p00858_A,00858,A,not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it
p00859_A,00859,A,i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders
p00860_A,00860,A,come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep
p00861_A,00861,A,i am ready whenever i am wanted
p00862_A,00862,A,whom are you going to dance with
p00863_A,00863,A,with you if you will ask me
p00864_A,00864,A,will you
p00865_A,00865,A,indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper
p00866_A,00866,A,miss woodhouse if you are at leisure i have something that i should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then you know it will be over it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish to have no reserves with you on this subject as i am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it i do not want to say more than is necessary i am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me
p00867_A,00867,A,yes i hope i do
p00868_A,00868,A,how i could so long a time be fancying myself it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept i know that very well however now i will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds
p00869_A,00869,A,not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing
p00870_A,00870,A,no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much now you must recollect
p00871_A,00871,A,no indeed i do not
p00872_A,00872,A,dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat
p00873_A,00873,A,my dearest harriet you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well go on what else
p00874_A,00874,A,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally
p00875_A,00875,A,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment
p00876_A,00876,A,i do remember it i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here
p00877_A,00877,A,ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now
p00878_A,00878,A,well go on
p00879_A,00879,A,oh that s all i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it
p00880_A,00880,A,my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things
p00881_A,00881,A,yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them
p00882_A,00882,A,but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful
p00883_A,00883,A,i shall be happier to burn it it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton
p00884_A,00884,A,i shall never marry
p00885_A,00885,A,never marry this is a new resolution
p00886_A,00886,A,it is one that i shall never change however
p00887_A,00887,A,i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton
p00888_A,00888,A,mr elton indeed oh no so superior to mr elton
p00889_A,00889,A,harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so
p00890_A,00890,A,oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially
p00891_A,00891,A,i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart
p00892_A,00892,A,service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness
p00893_A,00893,A,by the bye what became of mr perry s plan of setting up his carriage
p00894_A,00894,A,i did not know that he ever had any such plan
p00895_A,00895,A,nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago
p00896_A,00896,A,me impossible
p00897_A,00897,A,indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now
p00898_A,00898,A,upon my word i never heard of it till this moment
p00899_A,00899,A,never really never bless me how could it be then i must have dreamt it but i was completely persuaded miss smith you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find yourself at home
p00900_A,00900,A,what is this what is this about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you
p00901_A,00901,A,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry
p00902_A,00902,A,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think
p00903_A,00903,A,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed
p00904_A,00904,A,miss woodhouse have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again
p00905_A,00905,A,nonsense for shame
p00906_A,00906,A,i will give it to her shall i
p00907_A,00907,A,i did not know that proper names were allowed
p00908_A,00908,A,aye very true my dear i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night
p00909_A,00909,A,pray emma may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other
p00910_A,00910,A,oh it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves
p00911_A,00911,A,the joke seemed confined to you and mr churchill my dear emma do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of
p00912_A,00912,A,between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it
p00913_A,00913,A,have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him
p00914_A,00914,A,never never never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head
p00915_A,00915,A,i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public
p00916_A,00916,A,is not this most vexatious knightley and such weather for exploring these delays and disappointments are quite odious what are we to do the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston
p00917_A,00917,A,you had better explore to donwell that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries they are ripening fast
p00918_A,00918,A,oh i should like it of all things you may depend upon me i certainly will come name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring jane fairfax
p00919_A,00919,A,i cannot name a day till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you
p00920_A,00920,A,oh leave all that to me only give me a carte blanche i am lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends with me
p00921_A,00921,A,i hope you will bring elton but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations
p00922_A,00922,A,oh now you are looking very sly but consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to me i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party leave it all to me i will invite your guests
p00923_A,00923,A,no there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is
p00924_A,00924,A,mrs weston i suppose
p00925_A,00925,A,no mrs knightley and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself
p00926_A,00926,A,ah you are an odd creature you are a humourist and may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don t scruple i know you are attached to them
p00927_A,00927,A,you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home
p00928_A,00928,A,that s quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea
p00929_A,00929,A,not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house
p00930_A,00930,A,well as you please only don t have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything
p00931_A,00931,A,i have not the least wish for it i thank you
p00932_A,00932,A,well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever
p00933_A,00933,A,i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body s assistance
p00934_A,00934,A,i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me and my caro sposo walking by i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt
p00935_A,00935,A,you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible
p00936_A,00936,A,the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade
p00937_A,00937,A,will you be so kind when i am missed as to say that i am gone home i am going this moment my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent but i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly i have said nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone
p00938_A,00938,A,certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone
p00939_A,00939,A,yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at home in twenty minutes
p00940_A,00940,A,but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes
p00941_A,00941,A,thank you thank you but on no account i would rather walk and for me to be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have to guard others
p00942_A,00942,A,that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already
p00943_A,00943,A,i am i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone
p00944_A,00944,A,you will soon be cooler if you sit still
p00945_A,00945,A,as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met one as i came madness in such weather absolute madness
p00946_A,00946,A,as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places you will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour to read or my poem i shall do something to expose myself
p00947_A,00947,A,that may be but not by sketches in swisserland you will never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england
p00948_A,00948,A,they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england and would leave it to morrow if i could
p00949_A,00949,A,you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay
p00950_A,00950,A,i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person
p00951_A,00951,A,you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us
p00952_A,00952,A,no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure
p00953_A,00953,A,we are going to box hill to morrow you will join us it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us
p00954_A,00954,A,no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening
p00955_A,00955,A,but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning
p00956_A,00956,A,no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross
p00957_A,00957,A,then pray stay at richmond
p00958_A,00958,A,but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me
p00959_A,00959,A,these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more
p00960_A,00960,A,how much i am obliged to you for telling me to come to day if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again
p00961_A,00961,A,yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come
p00962_A,00962,A,don t say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me
p00963_A,00963,A,it is hotter to day
p00964_A,00964,A,not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to day
p00965_A,00965,A,you are comfortable because you are under command
p00966_A,00966,A,your command yes
p00967_A,00967,A,perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine
p00968_A,00968,A,it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me
p00969_A,00969,A,dating from three o clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before
p00970_A,00970,A,three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february
p00971_A,00971,A,nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people
p00972_A,00972,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of
p00973_A,00973,A,is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of
p00974_A,00974,A,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00975_A,00975,A,it is a sort of thing which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party i never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women
p00976_A,00976,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all
p00977_A,00977,A,oh very well then i need not be uneasy that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan t i do not you all think i shall
p00978_A,00978,A,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00979_A,00979,A,ah well to be sure yes i see what she means and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend
p00980_A,00980,A,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00981_A,00981,A,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00982_A,00982,A,no no it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it
p00983_A,00983,A,i doubt its being very clever myself it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection
p00984_A,00984,A,what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know
p00985_A,00985,A,ah you will never guess you i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand
p00986_A,00986,A,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00987_A,00987,A,oh for myself i protest i must be excused i really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us
p00988_A,00988,A,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00989_A,00989,A,with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm
p00990_A,00990,A,happy couple how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life
p00991_A,00991,A,such things do occur undoubtedly
p00992_A,00992,A,you were speaking
p00993_A,00993,A,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever
p00994_A,00994,A,well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you will you chuse a wife for me i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family you know find some body for me i am in no hurry adopt her educate her
p00995_A,00995,A,and make her like myself
p00996_A,00996,A,by all means if you can
p00997_A,00997,A,very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife
p00998_A,00998,A,she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember
p00999_A,00999,A,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p01000_A,01000,A,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p01001_A,01001,A,emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible
p01002_A,01002,A,nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me
p01003_A,01003,A,i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome
p01004_A,01004,A,oh i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her
p01005_A,01005,A,ah miss woodhouse how kind you are i suppose you have heard and are come to give us joy this does not seem much like joy indeed in me but it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning such long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs dixon said i for tears were in her eyes perpetually one cannot wonder one cannot wonder it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going out do not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortune but poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache she has when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve she is as low as possible to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation you will excuse her not coming to you she is not able she is gone into her own room i want her to lie down upon the bed said i but however she is not she is walking about the room but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her you were kept waiting at the door i was quite ashamed but somehow there was a little bustle for it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming said i said she but then patty came in and said it was you said i said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waiting and extremely sorry and ashamed we were said i so very kind but you are always kind
p01006_A,01006,A,where may i ask is miss fairfax going
p01007_A,01007,A,to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove
p01008_A,01008,A,mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes
p01009_A,01009,A,yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled
p01010_A,01010,A,you spent the evening with mrs elton
p01011_A,01011,A,yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley said she
p01012_A,01012,A,mr knightley was there too was he
p01013_A,01013,A,no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it
p01014_A,01014,A,miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day
p01015_A,01015,A,i dare say she had
p01016_A,01016,A,whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family
p01017_A,01017,A,thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane
p01018_A,01018,A,ah madam if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned
p01019_A,01019,A,you are so noble in your ideas
p01020_A,01020,A,and when is miss fairfax to leave you
p01021_A,01021,A,very soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more
p01022_A,01022,A,her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return
p01023_A,01023,A,i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries
p01024_A,01024,A,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p01025_A,01025,A,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time
p01026_A,01026,A,can you come to randalls at any time this morning do if it be possible mrs weston wants to see you she must see you
p01027_A,01027,A,is she unwell
p01028_A,01028,A,no no not at all only a little agitated she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know humph can you come
p01029_A,01029,A,certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter is she really not ill
p01030_A,01030,A,depend upon me but ask no more questions you will know it all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush
p01031_A,01031,A,now now mr weston do let me know what has happened
p01032_A,01032,A,no no don t ask me i promised my wife to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon
p01033_A,01033,A,break it to me good god mr weston tell me at once something has happened in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is
p01034_A,01034,A,no indeed you are mistaken
p01035_A,01035,A,mr weston do not trifle with me consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment
p01036_A,01036,A,upon my word emma
p01037_A,01037,A,your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family
p01038_A,01038,A,upon my honour it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley i was wrong in talking of its being broke to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls
p01039_A,01039,A,who is that gentleman on horseback
p01040_A,01040,A,i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not frank i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor by this time
p01041_A,01041,A,has your son been with you then
p01042_A,01042,A,what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be
p01043_A,01043,A,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear
p01044_A,01044,A,so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess
p01045_A,01045,A,you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment more than an attachment indeed an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged
p01046_A,01046,A,jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it
p01047_A,01047,A,you may well be amazed you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him
p01048_A,01048,A,well this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury
p01049_A,01049,A,engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally some part of his conduct we cannot excuse
p01050_A,01050,A,i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth
p01051_A,01051,A,mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account
p01052_A,01052,A,i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed
p01053_A,01053,A,from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine
p01054_A,01054,A,and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect
p01055_A,01055,A,there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct
p01056_A,01056,A,impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life
p01057_A,01057,A,nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and
p01058_A,01058,A,good god mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure
p01059_A,01059,A,he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long i am to hear from him soon he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment
p01060_A,01060,A,his sufferings do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it
p01061_A,01061,A,most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion
p01062_A,01062,A,this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning he stopped at highbury at the bates s i fancy some time and then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour he was very much agitated very much indeed to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him before in addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal
p01063_A,01063,A,and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement
p01064_A,01064,A,none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves
p01065_A,01065,A,well i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable
p01066_A,01066,A,i am quite easy on that head i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard
p01067_A,01067,A,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady
p01068_A,01068,A,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error
p01069_A,01069,A,well miss woodhouse is not this the oddest news that ever was
p01070_A,01070,A,what news do you mean
p01071_A,01071,A,about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it
p01072_A,01072,A,what did mr weston tell you
p01073_A,01073,A,oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd had you any idea of his being in love with her you perhaps might you who can see into every body s heart but nobody else
p01074_A,01074,A,upon my word i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly
p01075_A,01075,A,me why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill
p01076_A,01076,A,i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him
p01077_A,01077,A,him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me
p01078_A,01078,A,harriet what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then
p01079_A,01079,A,i should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him
p01080_A,01080,A,harriet let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley
p01081_A,01081,A,to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible
p01082_A,01082,A,not quite for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of
p01083_A,01083,A,oh miss woodhouse how you do forget
p01084_A,01084,A,my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory
p01085_A,01085,A,oh dear now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth
p01086_A,01086,A,good god this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what is to be done
p01087_A,01087,A,you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible i do not wonder miss woodhouse that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure
p01088_A,01088,A,have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection
p01089_A,01089,A,yes i must say that i have
p01090_A,01090,A,might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view
p01091_A,01091,A,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful
p01092_A,01092,A,on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months she was energetic this was one of her expressions and the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart
p01093_A,01093,A,poor girl she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement
p01094_A,01094,A,wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself said she she continued
p01095_A,01095,A,poor girl she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment
p01096_A,01096,A,yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him
p01097_A,01097,A,i am afraid that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy
p01098_A,01098,A,on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear said she she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself
p01099_A,01099,A,if i did not know her to be happy now which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers
p01100_A,01100,A,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come are you well my emma
p01101_A,01101,A,you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you
p01102_A,01102,A,have i of what nature
p01103_A,01103,A,oh the best nature in the world a wedding
p01104_A,01104,A,if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already
p01105_A,01105,A,how is it possible
p01106_A,01106,A,i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened
p01107_A,01107,A,you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but i seem to have been doomed to blindness
p01108_A,01108,A,time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her she deserves a better fate
p01109_A,01109,A,you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier
p01110_A,01110,A,emma are you indeed no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature
p01111_A,01111,A,mr knightley i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him
p01112_A,01112,A,i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well
p01113_A,01113,A,i have no doubt of their being happy together i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached
p01114_A,01114,A,he is a most fortunate man so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed
p01115_A,01115,A,you speak as if you envied him
p01116_A,01116,A,and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but i cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment
p01117_A,01117,A,oh then don t speak it don t speak it take a little time consider do not commit yourself
p01118_A,01118,A,thank you you are going in i suppose
p01119_A,01119,A,no i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think
p01120_A,01120,A,as a friend emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding my dearest emma for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said you are silent absolutely silent at present i ask no more i cannot make speeches emma if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice i shall be very glad to look it over but it seems long i will take it home with me at night i would rather be talking to you but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe it will be natural for me to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it
p01121_A,01121,A,not at all i should wish it
p01122_A,01122,A,he trifles here as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here
p01123_A,01123,A,and i have not forgotten how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right
p01124_A,01124,A,i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had you not been in the case i should still have distrusted him very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other
p01125_A,01125,A,you had better go on
p01126_A,01126,A,the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could i perfectly agree with you sir you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary
p01127_A,01127,A,nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers
p01128_A,01128,A,i hope he does smallridge what does this mean what is all this
p01129_A,01129,A,she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment
p01130_A,01130,A,say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes
p01131_A,01131,A,i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him
p01132_A,01132,A,well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands come he knows himself there those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it
p01133_A,01133,A,you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you
p01134_A,01134,A,yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject
p01135_A,01135,A,thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible to say yes indeed i quite understand dearest jane s prospects that is i do not mean but she is charmingly recovered how is mr woodhouse i am so glad quite out of my power such a happy little circle as you find us here yes indeed charming young man that is so very friendly i mean good mr perry such attention to jane
p01136_A,01136,A,yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you
p01137_A,01137,A,what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged
p01138_A,01138,A,he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation mr e is knightley s right hand
p01139_A,01139,A,is mr elton gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk
p01140_A,01140,A,oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way
p01141_A,01141,A,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday
p01142_A,01142,A,oh no the meeting is certainly to day i do believe this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove
p01143_A,01143,A,your parish there was small
p01144_A,01144,A,upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of
p01145_A,01145,A,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children
p01146_A,01146,A,very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted
p01147_A,01147,A,when i got to donwell knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one
p01148_A,01148,A,donwell my dear mr e you have not been to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown
p01149_A,01149,A,no no that s to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields too which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you explain it
p01150_A,01150,A,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it
p01151_A,01151,A,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose
p01152_A,01152,A,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent
p01153_A,01153,A,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend
p01154_A,01154,A,oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even
p01155_A,01155,A,you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you
p01156_A,01156,A,and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you
p01157_A,01157,A,oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell
p01158_A,01158,A,nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps but excuse me it must be thought of
p01159_A,01159,A,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for
p01160_A,01160,A,she has had the advantage you know of practising on me like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan
p01161_A,01161,A,that is she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference
p01162_A,01162,A,poor child at that rate what will become of her
p01163_A,01163,A,nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them
p01164_A,01164,A,but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it
p01165_A,01165,A,do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least
p01166_A,01166,A,i am sure you were of use to me i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen
p01167_A,01167,A,how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one
p01168_A,01168,A,what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance
p01169_A,01169,A,mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what
p01170_A,01170,A,i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again
p01171_A,01171,A,and cannot you call me george now
p01172_A,01172,A,impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse
p01173_A,01173,A,john does not even mention your friend here is his answer if you like to see it john enters like a brother into my happiness but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes
p01174_A,01174,A,he writes like a sensible man i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him
p01175_A,01175,A,my emma he means no such thing he only means
p01176_A,01176,A,he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject
p01177_A,01177,A,emma my dear emma
p01178_A,01178,A,oh if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther
p01179_A,01179,A,ah i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind
p01180_A,01180,A,if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that
p01181_A,01181,A,rather he than i
p01182_A,01182,A,i have something to tell you emma some news
p01183_A,01183,A,good or bad
p01184_A,01184,A,i do not know which it ought to be called
p01185_A,01185,A,oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile
p01186_A,01186,A,i am afraid i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it
p01187_A,01187,A,indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too
p01188_A,01188,A,there is one subject i hope but one on which we do not think alike does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith have you heard from her yourself this morning you have i believe and know the whole
p01189_A,01189,A,no i have not i know nothing pray tell me
p01190_A,01190,A,you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin it is so indeed i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject
p01191_A,01191,A,you mistake me you quite mistake me it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it
p01192_A,01192,A,i mean that he has done it and been accepted
p01193_A,01193,A,good god well well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible
p01194_A,01194,A,it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin
p01195_A,01195,A,you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before
p01196_A,01196,A,you ought to know your friend best but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her
p01197_A,01197,A,upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox
p01198_A,01198,A,do you dare say this do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve
p01199_A,01199,A,oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are
p01200_A,01200,A,i am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day
p01201_A,01201,A,i am perfectly satisfied and most sincerely wish them happy
p01202_A,01202,A,you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before
p01203_A,01203,A,i hope so for at that time i was a fool
p01204_A,01204,A,and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for
p01205_A,01205,A,i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs weston s letters i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon i hope you do not retract what you then said
p01206_A,01206,A,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person
p01207_A,01207,A,is not she looking well better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her
p01208_A,01208,A,i can never think of it without extreme shame
p01209_A,01209,A,the shame is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none
p01210_A,01210,A,i never had the smallest i assure you
p01211_A,01211,A,that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing
p01212_A,01212,A,it is not now worth a regret
p01213_A,01213,A,i have some hope of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me ah by the bye i hope mr knightley is well i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty
p01214_A,01214,A,i have always admired her complexion but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten
p01215_A,01215,A,oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare
p01216_A,01216,A,i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you
p01217_A,01217,A,oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch
p01218_A,01218,A,not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us if not in our dispositions there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own
p01219_A,01219,A,true true no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair
p01220_A,01220,A,very beautiful indeed
p01221_A,01221,A,perry my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage such an extraordinary dream of mine i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others
p01222_A,01222,A,i think we cannot do better let us send for the child
p01223_A,01223,A,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister
p01224_A,01224,A,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p01225_A,01225,A,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up
p01226_A,01226,A,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p01227_A,01227,A,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress
p01228_A,01228,A,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends
p01229_A,01229,A,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association
p01230_A,01230,A,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them
p01231_A,01231,A,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p01232_A,01232,A,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct
p01233_A,01233,A,my dear little cousin what can be the matter you are sorry to leave mama my dear little fanny which shows you to be a very good girl but you must remember that you are with relations and friends who all love you and wish to make you happy let us walk out in the park and you shall tell me all about your brothers and sisters
p01234_A,01234,A,no no not at all no thank you william did not like she should come away he had told her he should miss her very much indeed
p01235_A,01235,A,but william will write to you i dare say
p01236_A,01236,A,yes he had promised he would but he had told her to write first
p01237_A,01237,A,and when shall you do it
p01238_A,01238,A,she did not know she had not any paper
p01239_A,01239,A,if that be all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you choose would it make you happy to write to william
p01240_A,01240,A,yes very
p01241_A,01241,A,then let it be done now come with me into the breakfast room we shall find everything there and be sure of having the room to ourselves
p01242_A,01242,A,but cousin will it go to the post
p01243_A,01243,A,yes depend upon me it shall it shall go with the other letters and as your uncle will frank it it will cost william nothing
p01244_A,01244,A,my uncle
p01245_A,01245,A,dear mama only think my cousin cannot put the map of europe together or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in russia or she never heard of asia minor or she does not know the difference between water colours and crayons how strange did you ever hear anything so stupid
p01246_A,01246,A,but aunt she is really so very ignorant do you know we asked her last night which way she would go to get to ireland and she said she should cross to the isle of wight she thinks of nothing but the isle of wight and she calls it the island as if there were no other island in the world i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself if i had not known better long before i was so old as she is i cannot remember the time when i did not know a great deal that she has not the least notion of yet how long ago it is aunt since we used to repeat the chronological order of the kings of england with the dates of their accession and most of the principal events of their reigns yes and of the roman emperors as low as severus besides a great deal of the heathen mythology and all the metals semi metals planets and distinguished philosophers
p01247_A,01247,A,yes i know there is till i am seventeen but i must tell you another thing of fanny so odd and so stupid do you know she says she does not want to learn either music or drawing
p01248_A,01248,A,so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it
p01249_A,01249,A,going to leave you
p01250_A,01250,A,yes my dear why should you be astonished you have been five years with us and my sister always meant to take you when mr norris died but you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same
p01251_A,01251,A,i shall be very sorry to go away
p01252_A,01252,A,yes i dare say you will that s natural enough i suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world
p01253_A,01253,A,i hope i am not ungrateful aunt
p01254_A,01254,A,no my dear i hope not i have always found you a very good girl
p01255_A,01255,A,and am i never to live here again
p01256_A,01256,A,never my dear but you are sure of a comfortable home it can make very little difference to you whether you are in one house or the other
p01257_A,01257,A,yes my aunt bertram has just told me so it is quite settled i am to leave mansfield park and go to the white house i suppose as soon as she is removed there
p01258_A,01258,A,well fanny and if the plan were not unpleasant to you i should call it an excellent one
p01259_A,01259,A,oh cousin
p01260_A,01260,A,it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny
p01261_A,01261,A,indeed it does i cannot like it i love this house and everything in it i shall love nothing there you know how uncomfortable i feel with her
p01262_A,01262,A,i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child but it was the same with us all or nearly so she never knew how to be pleasant to children but you are now of an age to be treated better i think she is behaving better already and when you are her only companion you must be important to her
p01263_A,01263,A,i can never be important to any one
p01264_A,01264,A,what is to prevent you
p01265_A,01265,A,everything my situation my foolishness and awkwardness
p01266_A,01266,A,as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion
p01267_A,01267,A,you are too kind how shall i ever thank you as i ought for thinking so well of me oh cousin if i am to go away i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life
p01268_A,01268,A,why indeed fanny i should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the white house you speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park but you will belong to us almost as much as ever the two families will be meeting every day in the year the only difference will be that living with your aunt you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be here there are too many whom you can hide behind but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself
p01269_A,01269,A,oh do not say so
p01270_A,01270,A,i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers
p01271_A,01271,A,i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody here i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well
p01272_A,01272,A,the place fanny is what you will not quit though you quit the house you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change you will have the same walks to frequent the same library to choose from the same people to look at the same horse to ride
p01273_A,01273,A,very true yes dear old grey pony ah cousin when i remember how much i used to dread riding what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good oh how i have trembled at my uncle s opening his lips if horses were talked of and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears and convince me that i should like it after a little while and feel how right you proved to be i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well
p01274_A,01274,A,i think sister we need not keep miss lee any longer when fanny goes to live with you
p01275_A,01275,A,live with me dear lady bertram what do you mean
p01276_A,01276,A,is she not to live with you i thought you had settled it with sir thomas
p01277_A,01277,A,me never i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas nor he to me fanny live with me the last thing in the world for me to think of or for anybody to wish that really knows us both good heaven what could i do with fanny me a poor helpless forlorn widow unfit for anything my spirits quite broke down what could i do with a girl at her time of life a girl of fifteen the very age of all others to need most attention and care and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test sure sir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing sir thomas is too much my friend nobody that wishes me well i am sure would propose it how came sir thomas to speak to you about it
p01278_A,01278,A,indeed i do not know i suppose he thought it best
p01279_A,01279,A,but what did he say he could not say he wished me to take fanny i am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it
p01280_A,01280,A,no he only said he thought it very likely and i thought so too we both thought it would be a comfort to you but if you do not like it there is no more to be said she is no encumbrance here
p01281_A,01281,A,dear sister if you consider my unhappy state how can she be any comfort to me here am i a poor desolate widow deprived of the best of husbands my health gone in attending and nursing him my spirits still worse all my peace in this world destroyed with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed what possible comfort could i have in taking such a charge upon me as fanny if i could wish it for my own sake i would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl she is in good hands and sure of doing well i must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as i can
p01282_A,01282,A,then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone
p01283_A,01283,A,lady bertram i do not complain i know i cannot live as i have done but i must retrench where i can and learn to be a better manager i have been a liberal housekeeper enough but i shall not be ashamed to practise economy now my situation is as much altered as my income a great many things were due from poor mr norris as clergyman of the parish that cannot be expected from me it is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers at the white house matters must be better looked after i must live within my income or i shall be miserable and i own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more to lay by a little at the end of the year
p01284_A,01284,A,i dare say you will you always do don t you
p01285_A,01285,A,my object lady bertram is to be of use to those that come after me it is for your children s good that i wish to be richer i have nobody else to care for but i should be very glad to think i could leave a little trifle among them worth their having
p01286_A,01286,A,you are very good but do not trouble yourself about them they are sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of that
p01287_A,01287,A,why you know sir thomas s means will be rather straitened if the antigua estate is to make such poor returns
p01288_A,01288,A,oh that will soon be settled sir thomas has been writing about it i know
p01289_A,01289,A,fanny must have a horse fanny must have a horse
p01290_A,01290,A,and now i have thought of something to make it complete i should dearly love to settle you both in this country and therefore henry you shall marry the youngest miss bertram a nice handsome good humoured accomplished girl who will make you very happy
p01291_A,01291,A,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry
p01292_A,01292,A,my dear brother i will not believe this of you
p01293_A,01293,A,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p01294_A,01294,A,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him
p01295_A,01295,A,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p01296_A,01296,A,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage
p01297_A,01297,A,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls
p01298_A,01298,A,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best
p01299_A,01299,A,oh yes i like julia best
p01300_A,01300,A,but do you really for miss bertram is in general thought the handsomest
p01301_A,01301,A,so i should suppose she has the advantage in every feature and i prefer her countenance but i like julia best miss bertram is certainly the handsomest and i have found her the most agreeable but i shall always like julia best because you order me
p01302_A,01302,A,i shall not talk to you henry but i know you will like her best at last
p01303_A,01303,A,do not i tell you that i like her best at first
p01304_A,01304,A,and besides miss bertram is engaged remember that my dear brother her choice is made
p01305_A,01305,A,yes and i like her the better for it an engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged she is satisfied with herself her cares are over and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion all is safe with a lady engaged no harm can be done
p01306_A,01306,A,why as to that mr rushworth is a very good sort of young man and it is a great match for her
p01307_A,01307,A,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart
p01308_A,01308,A,mary how shall we manage him
p01309_A,01309,A,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last
p01310_A,01310,A,but i would not have him taken in i would not have him duped i would have it all fair and honourable
p01311_A,01311,A,oh dear let him stand his chance and be taken in it will do just as well everybody is taken in at some period or other
p01312_A,01312,A,not always in marriage dear mary
p01313_A,01313,A,in marriage especially with all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married my dear mrs grant there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry look where i will i see that it is so and i feel that it must be so when i consider that it is of all transactions the one in which people expect most from others and are least honest themselves
p01314_A,01314,A,ah you have been in a bad school for matrimony in hill street
p01315_A,01315,A,my poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state but however speaking from my own observation it is a manoeuvring business i know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion or accomplishment or good quality in the person who have found themselves entirely deceived and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse what is this but a take in
p01316_A,01316,A,my dear child there must be a little imagination here i beg your pardon but i cannot quite believe you depend upon it you see but half you see the evil but you do not see the consolation there will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere and we are all apt to expect too much but then if one scheme of happiness fails human nature turns to another if the first calculation is wrong we make a second better we find comfort somewhere and those evil minded observers dearest mary who make much of a little are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves
p01317_A,01317,A,well done sister i honour your esprit du corps when i am a wife i mean to be just as staunch myself and i wish my friends in general would be so too it would save me many a heartache
p01318_A,01318,A,you are as bad as your brother mary but we will cure you both mansfield shall cure you both and without any taking in stay with us and we will cure you
p01319_A,01319,A,i begin now to understand you all except miss price pray is she out or is she not i am puzzled she dined at the parsonage with the rest of you which seemed like being out and yet she says so little that i can hardly suppose she is
p01320_A,01320,A,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me
p01321_A,01321,A,and yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained the distinction is so broad manners as well as appearance are generally speaking so totally different till now i could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl s being out or not a girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word you may smile but it is so i assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper girls should be quiet and modest the most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence that is the faulty part of the present system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr bertram i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes
p01322_A,01322,A,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson
p01323_A,01323,A,no indeed miss anderson i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about
p01324_A,01324,A,ah you carry it off very well but i cannot be quite so far imposed on you must have had miss anderson in your eye in describing an altered young lady you paint too accurately for mistake it was exactly so the andersons of baker street we were speaking of them the other day you know edmund you have heard me mention charles anderson the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it when anderson first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not out and i could not get her to speak to me i sat there an hour one morning waiting for anderson with only her and a little girl or two in the room the governess being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business and i could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady nothing like a civil answer she screwed up her mouth and turned from me with such an air i did not see her again for a twelvemonth she was then out i met her at mrs holford s and did not recollect her she came up to me claimed me as an acquaintance stared me out of countenance and talked and laughed till i did not know which way to look i felt that i must be the jest of the room at the time and miss crawford it is plain has heard the story
p01325_A,01325,A,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong
p01326_A,01326,A,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right
p01327_A,01327,A,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p01328_A,01328,A,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting
p01329_A,01329,A,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p01330_A,01330,A,that was bad indeed poor miss sneyd though i have no younger sister i feel for her to be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault miss augusta should have been with her governess such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s
p01331_A,01331,A,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her
p01332_A,01332,A,i wish you could see compton it is the most complete thing i never saw a place so altered in my life i told smith i did not know where i was the approach now is one of the finest things in the country you see the house in the most surprising manner i declare when i got back to sotherton yesterday it looked like a prison quite a dismal old prison
p01333_A,01333,A,oh for shame a prison indeed sotherton court is the noblest old place in the world
p01334_A,01334,A,it wants improvement ma am beyond anything i never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life and it is so forlorn that i do not know what can be done with it
p01335_A,01335,A,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p01336_A,01336,A,i must try to do something with it but i do not know what i hope i shall have some good friend to help me
p01337_A,01337,A,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p01338_A,01338,A,that is what i was thinking of as he has done so well by smith i think i had better have him at once his terms are five guineas a day
p01339_A,01339,A,well and if they were ten i am sure you need not regard it the expense need not be any impediment if i were you i should not think of the expense i would have everything done in the best style and made as nice as possible such a place as sotherton court deserves everything that taste and money can do you have space to work upon there and grounds that will well reward you for my own part if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton i should be always planting and improving for naturally i am excessively fond of it it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where i am now with my little half acre it would be quite a burlesque but if i had more room i should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it you young ones do not remember much about it perhaps but if dear sir thomas were here he could tell you what improvements we made and a great deal more would have been done but for poor mr norris s sad state of health he could hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything and that disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to talk of if it had not been for that we should have carried on the garden wall and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard just as dr grant has done we were always doing something as it was it was only the spring twelvemonth before mr norris s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall which is now grown such a noble tree and getting to such perfection sir
p01340_A,01340,A,the tree thrives well beyond a doubt madam the soil is good and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering
p01341_A,01341,A,sir it is a moor park we bought it as a moor park and it cost us that is it was a present from sir thomas but i saw the bill and i know it cost seven shillings and was charged as a moor park
p01342_A,01342,A,you were imposed on ma am these potatoes have as much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree it is an insipid fruit at the best but a good apricot is eatable which none from my garden are
p01343_A,01343,A,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p01344_A,01344,A,smith s place is the admiration of all the country and it was a mere nothing before repton took it in hand i think i shall have repton
p01345_A,01345,A,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p01346_A,01346,A,smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds which is little enough and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved now at sotherton we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows so that i think if so much could be done at compton we need not despair there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house and it opens the prospect amazingly which makes me think that repton or anybody of that sort would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill you know
p01347_A,01347,A,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p01348_A,01348,A,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited
p01349_A,01349,A,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny
p01350_A,01350,A,i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down to see the place as it is now in its old state but i do not suppose i shall
p01351_A,01351,A,have you never been there no you never can and unluckily it is out of distance for a ride i wish we could contrive it
p01352_A,01352,A,i collect that sotherton is an old place and a place of some grandeur in any particular style of building
p01353_A,01353,A,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well
p01354_A,01354,A,i do not wish to influence mr rushworth but had i a place to new fashion i should not put myself into the hands of an improver i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty of my own choice and acquired progressively i would rather abide by my own blunders than by his
p01355_A,01355,A,you would know what you were about of course but that would not suit me i have no eye or ingenuity for such matters but as they are before me and had i a place of my own in the country i should be most thankful to any mr repton who would undertake it and give me as much beauty as he could for my money and i should never look at it till it was complete
p01356_A,01356,A,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p01357_A,01357,A,ay you have been brought up to it it was no part of my education and the only dose i ever had being administered by not the first favourite in the world has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances three years ago the admiral my honoured uncle bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures but it being excessively pretty it was soon found necessary to be improved and for three months we were all dirt and confusion without a gravel walk to step on or a bench fit for use i would have everything as complete as possible in the country shrubberies and flower gardens and rustic seats innumerable but it must all be done without my care henry is different he loves to be doing mr bertram i have tidings of my harp at last i am assured that it is safe at northampton and there it has probably been these ten days in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary the truth is that our inquiries were too direct we sent a servant we went ourselves this will not do seventy miles from london but this morning we heard of it in the right way it was seen by some farmer and he told the miller and the miller told the butcher and the butcher s son in law left word at the shop
p01358_A,01358,A,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay
p01359_A,01359,A,i am to have it to morrow but how do you think it is to be conveyed not by a wagon or cart oh no nothing of that kind could be hired in the village i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow
p01360_A,01360,A,you would find it difficult i dare say just now in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart
p01361_A,01361,A,i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly and as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farmyard nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the labourers all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s bailiff i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at
p01362_A,01362,A,you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse
p01363_A,01363,A,i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london maxim that everything is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has offered to fetch it in his barouche will it not be honourably conveyed i shall be most happy to play to you both at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr bertram if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery about it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose
p01364_A,01364,A,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing
p01365_A,01365,A,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter
p01366_A,01366,A,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p01367_A,01367,A,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us
p01368_A,01368,A,at sea has she in the king s service of course
p01369_A,01369,A,do you know anything of my cousin s captain captain marshall you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude
p01370_A,01370,A,among admirals large enough but we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various admirals i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the gradation of their pay and their bickerings and jealousies but in general i can assure you that they are all passed over and all very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals of rears and vices i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a pun i entreat
p01371_A,01371,A,it is a noble profession
p01372_A,01372,A,my dear henry have you nothing to say you have been an improver yourself and from what i hear of everingham it may vie with any place in england its natural beauties i am sure are great everingham as it used to be was perfect in my estimation such a happy fall of ground and such timber what would i not give to see it again
p01373_A,01373,A,nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it but i fear there would be some disappointment you would not find it equal to your present ideas in extent it is a mere nothing you would be surprised at its insignificance and as for improvement there was very little for me to do too little i should like to have been busy much longer
p01374_A,01374,A,you are fond of the sort of thing
p01375_A,01375,A,excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little remained to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before everingham was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a devourer of my own
p01376_A,01376,A,those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly you can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth you should assist him with your opinion
p01377_A,01377,A,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p01378_A,01378,A,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday
p01379_A,01379,A,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her
p01380_A,01380,A,it is her countenance that is so attractive she has a wonderful play of feature but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you fanny as not quite right
p01381_A,01381,A,oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an uncle with whom she has been living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating him they say quite like a son i could not have believed it
p01382_A,01382,A,i thought you would be struck it was very wrong very indecorous
p01383_A,01383,A,and very ungrateful i think
p01384_A,01384,A,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public
p01385_A,01385,A,do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs crawford as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral
p01386_A,01386,A,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection
p01387_A,01387,A,yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure william would never have used me so under any circumstances and what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent
p01388_A,01388,A,my dear miss price i am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting but i have nothing in the world to say for myself i knew it was very late and that i was behaving extremely ill and therefore if you please you must forgive me selfishness must always be forgiven you know because there is no hope of a cure
p01389_A,01389,A,for there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise i wish you had saved yourself this walk home
p01390_A,01390,A,i was sure she would ride well she has the make for it her figure is as neat as her brother s
p01391_A,01391,A,no i do not know not if you want the mare
p01392_A,01392,A,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health
p01393_A,01393,A,i shall not ride to morrow certainly i have been out very often lately and would rather stay at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well
p01394_A,01394,A,but where is fanny is she gone to bed
p01395_A,01395,A,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa
p01396_A,01396,A,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p01397_A,01397,A,fanny i am sure you have the headache i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it
p01398_A,01398,A,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p01399_A,01399,A,did you go out in the heat
p01400_A,01400,A,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p01401_A,01401,A,yes indeed edmund i was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while fanny cut the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the alcove but i declare i quite dreaded the coming home again
p01402_A,01402,A,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p01403_A,01403,A,yes and i am afraid they will be the last this year poor thing she found it hot enough but they were so full blown that one could not wait
p01404_A,01404,A,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p01405_A,01405,A,she has got it she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time
p01406_A,01406,A,what has she been walking as well as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head aches
p01407_A,01407,A,i was afraid it would be too much for her but when the roses were gathered your aunt wished to have them and then you know they must be taken home
p01408_A,01408,A,but were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice
p01409_A,01409,A,no but they were to be put into the spare room to dry and unluckily fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key so she was obliged to go again
p01410_A,01410,A,i am sure i do not know how it was to have been done better unless i had gone myself indeed but i cannot be in two places at once and i was talking to mr green at that very time about your mother s dairymaid by her desire and had promised john groom to write to mrs jefferies about his son and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour i think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion but really i cannot do everything at once and as for fanny s just stepping down to my house for me it is not much above a quarter of a mile i cannot think i was unreasonable to ask it how often do i pace it three times a day early and late ay and in all weathers too and say nothing about it
p01411_A,01411,A,i wish fanny had half your strength ma am
p01412_A,01412,A,i am afraid it was indeed i am very much afraid she caught the headache there for the heat was enough to kill anybody it was as much as i could bear myself sitting and calling to pug and trying to keep him from the flower beds was almost too much for me
p01413_A,01413,A,the fatigue would be too much for my sister a great deal too much i assure you my dear mrs rushworth ten miles there and ten back you know you must excuse my sister on this occasion and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her sotherton is the only place that could give her a wish to go so far but it cannot be indeed she will have a companion in fanny price you know so it will all do very well and as for edmund as he is not here to speak for himself i will answer for his being most happy to join the party he can go on horseback you know
p01414_A,01414,A,the loss of her ladyship s company would be a great drawback and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it was a pity she should not see the place
p01415_A,01415,A,you are very kind you are all kindness my dear madam but as to fanny she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing sotherton she has time enough before her and her going now is quite out of the question lady bertram could not possibly spare her
p01416_A,01416,A,but why is it necessary that crawford s carriage or his only should be employed why is no use to be made of my mother s chaise i could not when the scheme was first mentioned the other day understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family
p01417_A,01417,A,what go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather when we may have seats in a barouche no my dear edmund that will not quite do
p01418_A,01418,A,besides i know that mr crawford depends upon taking us after what passed at first he would claim it as a promise
p01419_A,01419,A,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p01420_A,01420,A,that would not be a very handsome reason for using mr crawford s but the truth is that wilcox is a stupid old fellow and does not know how to drive i will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on wednesday
p01421_A,01421,A,there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the barouche box
p01422_A,01422,A,unpleasant oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss crawford will choose the barouche box herself
p01423_A,01423,A,there can be no objection then to fanny s going with you there can be no doubt of your having room for her
p01424_A,01424,A,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p01425_A,01425,A,you can have no reason i imagine madam for wishing fanny not to be of the party but as it relates to yourself to your own comfort if you could do without her you would not wish to keep her at home
p01426_A,01426,A,to be sure not but i cannot do without her
p01427_A,01427,A,you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do yes there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home fanny has a great desire to see sotherton i know she wishes it very much she has not often a gratification of the kind and i am sure ma am you would be glad to give her the pleasure now
p01428_A,01428,A,oh yes very glad if your aunt sees no objection
p01429_A,01429,A,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p01430_A,01430,A,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p01431_A,01431,A,i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you
p01432_A,01432,A,as there are five of you it will be better that one should sit with henry and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive julia i think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson
p01433_A,01433,A,here is a fine burst of country i wish you had my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me press you ever so much
p01434_A,01434,A,now we shall have no more rough road miss crawford our difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the parsonage a tidy looking house and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people those are almshouses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respectable man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach
p01435_A,01435,A,now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore must be at the back of it mr rushworth talked of the west front
p01436_A,01436,A,now we are coming to the chapel which properly we ought to enter from above and look down upon but as we are quite among friends i will take you in this way if you will excuse me
p01437_A,01437,A,i am disappointed this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a
p01438_A,01438,A,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements
p01439_A,01439,A,this chapel was fitted up as you see it in james the second s time before that period as i understand the pews were only wainscot and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth but this is not quite certain it is a handsome chapel and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain within the memory of many but the late mr rushworth left it off
p01440_A,01440,A,every generation has its improvements
p01441_A,01441,A,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p01442_A,01442,A,very fine indeed it must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure and say their prayers here twice a day while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away
p01443_A,01443,A,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom
p01444_A,01444,A,at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects everybody likes to go their own way to chuse their own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the formality the restraint the length of time altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a headache without danger of reprobation because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel the young mrs eleanors and mrs bridgets starched up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and in those days i fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now
p01445_A,01445,A,your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects you have given us an amusing sketch and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent thing that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected in a closet
p01446_A,01446,A,yes very likely they would have two chances at least in their favour there would be less to distract the attention from without and it would not be tried so long
p01447_A,01447,A,do look at mr rushworth and maria standing side by side exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed have not they completely the air of it
p01448_A,01448,A,i do not like to see miss bertram so near the altar
p01449_A,01449,A,if he would give her away
p01450_A,01450,A,my dear edmund if you were but in orders now you might perform the ceremony directly how unlucky that you are not ordained mr rushworth and maria are quite ready
p01451_A,01451,A,ordained what are you to be a clergyman
p01452_A,01452,A,yes i shall take orders soon after my father s return probably at christmas
p01453_A,01453,A,for if we are too long going over the house we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors it is past two and we are to dine at five
p01454_A,01454,A,suppose we turn down here for the present here are the greatest number of our plants and here are the curious pheasants
p01455_A,01455,A,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p01456_A,01456,A,james i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party the miss bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet
p01457_A,01457,A,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me
p01458_A,01458,A,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor
p01459_A,01459,A,very true but in short it had not occurred to me and you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son
p01460_A,01460,A,a very praiseworthy practice but not quite universal i am one of the exceptions and being one must do something for myself
p01461_A,01461,A,but why are you to be a clergyman i thought that was always the lot of the youngest where there were many to chuse before him
p01462_A,01462,A,do you think the church itself never chosen then
p01463_A,01463,A,never is a black word but yes in the never of conversation which means not very often i do think it for what is to be done in the church men love to distinguish themselves and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained but not in the church a clergyman is nothing
p01464_A,01464,A,the nothing of conversation has its gradations i hope as well as the never a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion he must not head mobs or set the ton in dress but i cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind individually or collectively considered temporally and eternally which has the guardianship of religion and morals and consequently of the manners which result from their influence no one here can call the office nothing if the man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his duty by foregoing its just importance and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear
p01465_A,01465,A,you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given or than i can quite comprehend one does not see much of this influence and importance in society and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sermons a week even supposing them worth hearing supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer blair s to his own do all that you speak of govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit
p01466_A,01466,A,you are speaking of london i am speaking of the nation at large
p01467_A,01467,A,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest
p01468_A,01468,A,there you have quite convinced miss price already
p01469_A,01469,A,i wish i could convince miss crawford too
p01470_A,01470,A,i do not think you ever will i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law
p01471_A,01471,A,go into the law with as much ease as i was told to go into this wilderness
p01472_A,01472,A,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you
p01473_A,01473,A,you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out
p01474_A,01474,A,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p01475_A,01475,A,my dear fanny how thoughtless i have been i hope you are not very tired perhaps my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm
p01476_A,01476,A,thank you but i am not at all tired
p01477_A,01477,A,you scarcely touch me you do not make me of any use what a difference in the weight of a woman s arm from that of a man at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only a fly in the comparison
p01478_A,01478,A,i am really not tired which i almost wonder at for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood do not you think we have
p01479_A,01479,A,not half a mile
p01480_A,01480,A,oh you do not consider how much we have wound about we have taken such a very serpentine course and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path
p01481_A,01481,A,but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked down the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a furlong in length
p01482_A,01482,A,oh i know nothing of your furlongs but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass
p01483_A,01483,A,we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here do you think we are walking four miles an hour
p01484_A,01484,A,oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a watch
p01485_A,01485,A,i am afraid you are very tired fanny why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon miss crawford except riding
p01486_A,01486,A,how abominable in you then to let me engross her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of myself but it shall never happen again
p01487_A,01487,A,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me
p01488_A,01488,A,that she should be tired now however gives me no surprise for there is nothing in the course of one s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning seeing a great house dawdling from one room to another straining one s eyes and one s attention hearing what one does not understand admiring what one does not care for it is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world and miss price has found it so though she did not know it
p01489_A,01489,A,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p01490_A,01490,A,i must move resting fatigues me i have looked across the ha ha till i am weary i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view without being able to see it so well
p01491_A,01491,A,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile
p01492_A,01492,A,miss price all alone my dear fanny how comes this
p01493_A,01493,A,poor dear fanny how ill you have been used by them you had better have staid with us
p01494_A,01494,A,it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far from the house already
p01495_A,01495,A,yes there is nothing else to be done but now sincerely do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected
p01496_A,01496,A,no indeed far otherwise i find it better grander more complete in its style though that style may not be the best and to tell you the truth i do not think that i shall ever see sotherton again with so much pleasure as i do now another summer will hardly improve it to me
p01497_A,01497,A,you are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world if other people think sotherton improved i have no doubt that you will
p01498_A,01498,A,i am afraid i am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points my feelings are not quite so evanescent nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world
p01499_A,01499,A,you seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning i was glad to see you so well entertained you and julia were laughing the whole way
p01500_A,01500,A,were we yes i believe we were but i have not the least recollection at what oh i believe i was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old irish groom of my uncle s your sister loves to laugh
p01501_A,01501,A,you think her more light hearted than i am
p01502_A,01502,A,more easily amused consequently you know better company i could not have hoped to entertain you with irish anecdotes during a ten miles drive
p01503_A,01503,A,naturally i believe i am as lively as julia but i have more to think of now
p01504_A,01504,A,you have undoubtedly and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility your prospects however are too fair to justify want of spirits you have a very smiling scene before you
p01505_A,01505,A,do you mean literally or figuratively literally i conclude yes certainly the sun shines and the park looks very cheerful but unluckily that iron gate that ha ha give me a feeling of restraint and hardship i cannot get out as the starling said mr rushworth is so long fetching this key
p01506_A,01506,A,and for the world you would not get out without the key and without mr rushworth s authority and protection or i think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate here with my assistance i think it might be done if you really wished to be more at large and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited
p01507_A,01507,A,prohibited nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr rushworth will be here in a moment you know we shall not be out of sight
p01508_A,01508,A,or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll the grove of oak on the knoll
p01509_A,01509,A,you will hurt yourself miss bertram you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes you will tear your gown you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go
p01510_A,01510,A,heyday where are the others i thought maria and mr crawford were with you a pretty trick upon my word i cannot see them anywhere but they cannot be very far off and i think i am equal to as much as maria even without help
p01511_A,01511,A,but julia mr rushworth will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr rushworth
p01512_A,01512,A,not i indeed i have had enough of the family for one morning why child i have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother such a penance as i have been enduring while you were sitting here so composed and so happy it might have been as well perhaps if you had been in my place but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes yes yes we saw him he was posting away as if upon life and death and could but just spare time to tell us his errand and where you all were
p01513_A,01513,A,it is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing
p01514_A,01514,A,that is miss maria s concern i am not obliged to punish myself for her sins the mother i could not avoid as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper but the son i can get away from
p01515_A,01515,A,they desired me to stay my cousin maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll or thereabouts
p01516_A,01516,A,i do not believe i shall go any farther i see nothing of them by the time i get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else i have had walking enough
p01517_A,01517,A,i am very sorry it is very unlucky
p01518_A,01518,A,i think they might as well have staid for me
p01519_A,01519,A,miss bertram thought you would follow her
p01520_A,01520,A,i should not have had to follow her if she had staid pray miss price are you such a great admirer of this mr crawford as some people are for my part i can see nothing in him
p01521_A,01521,A,i do not think him at all handsome
p01522_A,01522,A,handsome nobody can call such an undersized man handsome he is not five foot nine i should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight i think he is an ill looking fellow in my opinion these crawfords are no addition at all we did very well without them if i had made any difficulty about fetching the key there might have been some excuse but i went the very moment she said she wanted it
p01523_A,01523,A,nothing could be more obliging than your manner i am sure and i dare say you walked as fast as you could but still it is some distance you know from this spot to the house quite into the house and when people are waiting they are bad judges of time and every half minute seems like five it is a pity you should not join them they expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park and will be thinking how it may be improved and nothing of that sort you know can be settled without you
p01524_A,01524,A,well fanny this has been a fine day for you upon my word nothing but pleasure from beginning to end i am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt bertram and me for contriving to let you go a pretty good day s amusement you have had
p01525_A,01525,A,i think you have done pretty well yourself ma am your lap seems full of good things and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully
p01526_A,01526,A,my dear it is only a beautiful little heath which that nice old gardener would make me take but if it is in your way i will have it in my lap directly there fanny you shall carry that parcel for me take great care of it do not let it fall it is a cream cheese just like the excellent one we had at dinner nothing would satisfy that good old mrs whitaker but my taking one of the cheeses i stood out as long as i could till the tears almost came into her eyes and i knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with that mrs whitaker is a treasure she was quite shocked when i asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns take care of the cheese fanny now i can manage the other parcel and the basket very well
p01527_A,01527,A,what else have you been spunging
p01528_A,01528,A,how happy mr rushworth looks he is thinking of november your father s return will be a very interesting event
p01529_A,01529,A,it will indeed after such an absence an absence not only long but including so many dangers
p01530_A,01530,A,don t be affronted but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes who after performing great exploits in a foreign land offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return
p01531_A,01531,A,there is no sacrifice in the case it is entirely her own doing
p01532_A,01532,A,oh yes i know it is i was merely joking she has done no more than what every young woman would do and i have no doubt of her being extremely happy my other sacrifice of course you do not understand
p01533_A,01533,A,my taking orders i assure you is quite as voluntary as maria s marrying
p01534_A,01534,A,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts
p01535_A,01535,A,which you suppose has biassed me
p01536_A,01536,A,but that i am sure it has not
p01537_A,01537,A,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly
p01538_A,01538,A,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear
p01539_A,01539,A,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors
p01540_A,01540,A,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision
p01541_A,01541,A,what take orders without a living no that is madness indeed absolute madness
p01542_A,01542,A,shall i ask you how the church is to be filled if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without no for you certainly would not know what to say but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession as heroism and noise and fashion are all against him he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his
p01543_A,01543,A,oh no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made to the trouble of working for one and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat drink and grow fat it is indolence mr bertram indeed indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition of taste for good company or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable which make men clergymen a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper watch the weather and quarrel with his wife his curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine
p01544_A,01544,A,there are such clergymen no doubt but i think they are not so common as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character i suspect that in this comprehensive and may i say commonplace censure you are not judging from yourself but from prejudiced persons whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing it is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively you are speaking what you have been told at your uncle s table
p01545_A,01545,A,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information
p01546_A,01546,A,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away
p01547_A,01547,A,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p01548_A,01548,A,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p01549_A,01549,A,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p01550_A,01550,A,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p01551_A,01551,A,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night
p01552_A,01552,A,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons
p01553_A,01553,A,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it
p01554_A,01554,A,there goes good humour i am sure there goes a temper which would never give pain how well she walks and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others joining them the moment she is asked what a pity that she should have been in such hands
p01555_A,01555,A,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene
p01556_A,01556,A,i like to hear your enthusiasm fanny it is a lovely night and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel in some degree as you do who have not at least been given a taste for nature in early life they lose a great deal
p01557_A,01557,A,you taught me to think and feel on the subject cousin
p01558_A,01558,A,i had a very apt scholar there s arcturus looking very bright
p01559_A,01559,A,yes and the bear i wish i could see cassiopeia
p01560_A,01560,A,we must go out on the lawn for that should you be afraid
p01561_A,01561,A,not in the least it is a great while since we have had any star gazing
p01562_A,01562,A,yes i do not know how it has happened we will stay till this is finished fanny
p01563_A,01563,A,i am rather surprised that mr crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to much gayer places than mansfield
p01564_A,01564,A,it is to his credit and i dare say it gives his sister pleasure she does not like his unsettled habits
p01565_A,01565,A,what a favourite he is with my cousins
p01566_A,01566,A,yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs grant i believe suspects him of a preference for julia i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove
p01567_A,01567,A,if miss bertram were not engaged i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia
p01568_A,01568,A,i think ma am we shall see some happy faces again now
p01569_A,01569,A,yes ma am indeed there will be some satisfaction in looking on now and i think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms i wonder my son did not propose it
p01570_A,01570,A,i dare say he did ma am mr rushworth is never remiss but dear maria has such a strict sense of propriety so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays mrs rushworth that wish of avoiding particularity dear ma am only look at her face at this moment how different from what it was the two last dances it is quite delightful ma am to see young people so properly happy so well suited and so much the thing i cannot but think of dear sir thomas s delight and what do you say ma am to the chance of another match mr rushworth has set a good example and such things are very catching the couple above ma am do you see no symptoms there
p01571_A,01571,A,oh dear miss julia and mr crawford yes indeed a very pretty match what is his property
p01572_A,01572,A,four thousand a year
p01573_A,01573,A,very well those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have four thousand a year is a pretty estate and he seems a very genteel steady young man so i hope miss julia will be very happy
p01574_A,01574,A,a strange business this in america dr grant what is your opinion i always come to you to know what i am to think of public matters
p01575_A,01575,A,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him
p01576_A,01576,A,it was a hard case upon my word i do think you were very much to be pitied
p01577_A,01577,A,it is not worth complaining about but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted it was but three days and being only a grandmother and all happening two hundred miles off i think there would have been no great harm and it was suggested i know but lord ravenshaw who i suppose is one of the most correct men in england would not hear of it
p01578_A,01578,A,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p01579_A,01579,A,oh for the ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with
p01580_A,01580,A,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p01581_A,01581,A,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p01582_A,01582,A,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p01583_A,01583,A,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p01584_A,01584,A,nay let us do nothing by halves if we are to act let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit boxes and gallery and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so as it be a german play no matter what with a good tricking shifting afterpiece and a figure dance and a hornpipe and a song between the acts if we do not outdo ecclesford we do nothing
p01585_A,01585,A,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p01586_A,01586,A,true to see real acting good hardened real acting but i would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade a set of gentlemen and ladies who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through
p01587_A,01587,A,such a horribly vile billiard table as ours is not to be met with i believe above ground i can stand it no longer and i think i may say that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again but one good thing i have just ascertained it is the very room for a theatre precisely the shape and length for it and the doors at the farther end communicating with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes by merely moving the bookcase in my father s room is the very thing we could have desired if we had sat down to wish for it and my father s room will be an excellent greenroom it seems to join the billiard room on purpose
p01588_A,01588,A,you are not serious tom in meaning to act
p01589_A,01589,A,not serious never more so i assure you what is there to surprise you in it
p01590_A,01590,A,i think it would be very wrong in a general light private theatricals are open to some objections but as we are circumstanced i must think it would be highly injudicious and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind it would shew great want of feeling on my father s account absent as he is and in some degree of constant danger and it would be imprudent i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate
p01591_A,01591,A,by jove this won t do to be sure my dear mother your anxiety i was unlucky there
p01592_A,01592,A,what is the matter i was not asleep
p01593_A,01593,A,but this i will maintain that we shall be doing no harm
p01594_A,01594,A,i cannot agree with you i am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it
p01595_A,01595,A,and i am convinced to the contrary nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people or promotes it more than my father and for anything of the acting spouting reciting kind i think he has always a decided taste i am sure he encouraged it in us as boys how many a time have we mourned over the dead body of julius caesar and to be d and not to be d in this very room for his amusement and i am sure my name was norval every evening of my life through one christmas holidays
p01596_A,01596,A,it was a very different thing you must see the difference yourself my father wished us as schoolboys to speak well but he would never wish his grown up daughters to be acting plays his sense of decorum is strict
p01597_A,01597,A,i know all that i know my father as well as you do and i ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him manage your own concerns edmund and i ll take care of the rest of the family
p01598_A,01598,A,if you are resolved on acting i must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way and i think a theatre ought not to be attempted it would be taking liberties with my father s house in his absence which could not be justified
p01599_A,01599,A,for everything of that nature i will be answerable his house shall not be hurt i have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have and as to such alterations as i was suggesting just now such as moving a bookcase or unlocking a door or even as using the billiard room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room and less in the breakfast room than we did before he went away or to my sister s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other absolute nonsense
p01600_A,01600,A,the innovation if not wrong as an innovation will be wrong as an expense
p01601_A,01601,A,yes the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly but it will be on the simplest plan a green curtain and a little carpenter s work and that s all and as the carpenter s work may be all done at home by christopher jackson himself it will be too absurd to talk of expense and as long as jackson is employed everything will be right with sir thomas don t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself don t act yourself if you do not like it but don t expect to govern everybody else
p01602_A,01602,A,perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit them your brother s taste and your sisters seem very different
p01603_A,01603,A,i have no hope there fanny if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them and that is all i can do
p01604_A,01604,A,i should think my aunt norris would be on your side
p01605_A,01605,A,oh no that will never do let us have no ranting tragedies too many characters not a tolerable woman s part in the play anything but that my dear tom it would be impossible to fill it up one could not expect anybody to take such a part nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end that might do perhaps but for the low parts if i must give my opinion i have always thought it the most insipid play in the english language i do not wish to make objections i shall be happy to be of any use but i think we could not chuse worse
p01606_A,01606,A,this will never do we are wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many must not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making anything of it from this moment i make no difficulties i take any part you chuse to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the ravenshaws how came it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here are two capital tragic parts for yates and crawford and here is the rhyming butler for me if nobody else wants it a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and as i said before i am determined to take anything and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by anybody it is only count cassel and anhalt
p01607_A,01607,A,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p01608_A,01608,A,it falls as naturally as necessarily to her as agatha does to one or other of my sisters it can be no sacrifice on their side for it is highly comic
p01609_A,01609,A,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p01610_A,01610,A,oh yes maria must be agatha maria will be the best agatha though julia fancies she prefers tragedy i would not trust her in it there is nothing of tragedy about her she has not the look of it her features are not tragic features and she walks too quick and speaks too quick and would not keep her countenance she had better do the old countrywoman the cottager s wife you had indeed julia cottager s wife is a very pretty part i assure you the old lady relieves the high flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit you shall be cottager s wife
p01611_A,01611,A,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p01612_A,01612,A,why as to that my good friend till i and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork but i mean no disparagement to julia we cannot have two agathas and we must have one cottager s wife and i am sure i set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old butler if the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous let her take cottager s speeches instead of cottager s wife s and so change the parts all through he is solemn and pathetic enough i am sure it could make no difference in the play and as for cottager himself when he has got his wife s speeches i would undertake him with all my heart
p01613_A,01613,A,with all your partiality for cottager s wife it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her to accept the part she must not be left to her own complaisance her talents will be wanted in amelia amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha i consider amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece it requires great powers great nicety to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good actresses fail in the part simplicity indeed is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not it requires a gentlewoman a julia bertram you will undertake it i hope
p01614_A,01614,A,no no julia must not be amelia it is not at all the part for her she would not like it she would not do well she is too tall and robust amelia should be a small light girlish skipping figure it is fit for miss crawford and miss crawford only she looks the part and i am persuaded will do it admirably
p01615_A,01615,A,you must oblige us indeed you must when you have studied the character i am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be your choice but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions you will not refuse to visit me in prison i think i see you coming in with your basket
p01616_A,01616,A,you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering
p01617_A,01617,A,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p01618_A,01618,A,do not be afraid of my wanting the character i am not to be agatha and i am sure i will do nothing else and as to amelia it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me i quite detest her an odious little pert unnatural impudent girl i have always protested against comedy and this is comedy in its worst form
p01619_A,01619,A,we have got a play it is to be lovers vows and i am to be count cassel and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit by way of a shooting dress i do not know how i shall like it
p01620_A,01620,A,lovers vows
p01621_A,01621,A,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p01622_A,01622,A,but what do you do for women
p01623_A,01623,A,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p01624_A,01624,A,i should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up with us
p01625_A,01625,A,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p01626_A,01626,A,i cannot before mr yates speak what i feel as to this play without reflecting on his friends at ecclesford but i must now my dear maria tell you that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation and that i hope you will give it up i cannot but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt and see how you can approve it it will not be necessary to send you to your father s judgment i am convinced
p01627_A,01627,A,we see things very differently i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few omissions and so forth which will be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and i am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation
p01628_A,01628,A,i am sorry for it but in this matter it is you who are to lead you must set the example if others have blundered it is your place to put them right and shew them what true delicacy is in all points of decorum your conduct must be law to the rest of the party
p01629_A,01629,A,i am much obliged to you edmund you mean very well i am sure but i still think you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would be the greatest indecorum i think
p01630_A,01630,A,do you imagine that i could have such an idea in my head no let your conduct be the only harangue say that on examining the part you feel yourself unequal to it that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have say this with firmness and it will be quite enough all who can distinguish will understand your motive the play will be given up and your delicacy honoured as it ought
p01631_A,01631,A,do not act anything improper my dear sir thomas would not like it fanny ring the bell i must have my dinner to be sure julia is dressed by this time
p01632_A,01632,A,i am convinced madam that sir thomas would not like it
p01633_A,01633,A,there my dear do you hear what edmund says
p01634_A,01634,A,if i were to decline the part julia would certainly take it
p01635_A,01635,A,what if she knew your reasons
p01636_A,01636,A,oh she might think the difference between us the difference in our situations that she need not be so scrupulous as i might feel necessary i am sure she would argue so no you must excuse me i cannot retract my consent it is too far settled everybody would be so disappointed tom would be quite angry and if we are so very nice we shall never act anything
p01637_A,01637,A,well how do you go on what have you settled oh we can do nothing without you
p01638_A,01638,A,mr rushworth was to be count cassel but no one had yet undertaken anhalt
p01639_A,01639,A,i had my choice of the parts but i thought i should like the count best though i do not much relish the finery i am to have
p01640_A,01640,A,you chose very wisely i am sure anhalt is a heavy part
p01641_A,01641,A,the count has two and forty speeches which is no trifle
p01642_A,01642,A,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men
p01643_A,01643,A,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again
p01644_A,01644,A,your brother should take the part do not you think he would
p01645_A,01645,A,they do not want me at all i only puzzle them and oblige them to make civil speeches mr edmund bertram as you do not act yourself you will be a disinterested adviser and therefore i apply to you what shall we do for an anhalt is it practicable for any of the others to double it what is your advice
p01646_A,01646,A,my advice is that you change the play
p01647_A,01647,A,i should have no objection for though i should not particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported that is if everything went well i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table it certainly will not be taken if any part could tempt you to act i suppose it would be anhalt for he is a clergyman you know
p01648_A,01648,A,fanny we want your services oh we do not want to disturb you from your seat we do not want your present services we shall only want you in our play you must be cottager s wife
p01649_A,01649,A,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p01650_A,01650,A,indeed but you must for we cannot excuse you it need not frighten you it is a nothing of a part a mere nothing not above half a dozen speeches altogether and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say so you may be as creep mouse as you like but we must have you to look at
p01651_A,01651,A,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p01652_A,01652,A,it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart but i really cannot act
p01653_A,01653,A,yes yes you can act well enough for us learn your part and we will teach you all the rest you have only two scenes and as i shall be cottager i ll put you in and push you about and you will do it very well i ll answer for it
p01654_A,01654,A,no indeed mr bertram you must excuse me you cannot have an idea it would be absolutely impossible for me if i were to undertake it i should only disappoint you
p01655_A,01655,A,phoo phoo do not be so shamefaced you ll do it very well every allowance will be made for you we do not expect perfection you must get a brown gown and a white apron and a mob cap and we must make you a few wrinkles and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes and you will be a very proper little old woman
p01656_A,01656,A,you must excuse me indeed you must excuse me
p01657_A,01657,A,what a piece of work here is about nothing i am quite ashamed of you fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you take the part with a good grace and let us hear no more of the matter i entreat
p01658_A,01658,A,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p01659_A,01659,A,i am not going to urge her but i shall think her a very obstinate ungrateful girl if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her very ungrateful indeed considering who and what she is
p01660_A,01660,A,but there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it we have but to speak the word we may pick and chuse i could name at this moment at least six young men within six miles of us who are wild to be admitted into our company and there are one or two that would not disgrace us i should not be afraid to trust either of the olivers or charles maddox tom oliver is a very clever fellow and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere so i will take my horse early to morrow morning and ride over to stoke and settle with one of them
p01661_A,01661,A,as far as i am concerned i can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible have i ever seen either of the gentlemen yes mr charles maddox dined at my sister s one day did not he henry a quiet looking young man i remember him let him be applied to if you please for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger
p01662_A,01662,A,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p01663_A,01663,A,i am not very sanguine as to our play and i can tell mr maddox that i shall shorten some of his speeches and a great many of my own before we rehearse together it will be very disagreeable and by no means what i expected
p01664_A,01664,A,come in
p01665_A,01665,A,can i speak with you fanny for a few minutes
p01666_A,01666,A,yes certainly
p01667_A,01667,A,i want to consult i want your opinion
p01668_A,01668,A,my opinion
p01669_A,01669,A,yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse you see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles maddox but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light
p01670_A,01670,A,yes but what can be done your brother is so determined
p01671_A,01671,A,there is but one thing to be done fanny i must take anhalt myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom it is not at all what i like no man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alternative can you fanny
p01672_A,01672,A,no not immediately but
p01673_A,01673,A,but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that may of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner domesticated among us authorised to come at all hours and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints to think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create it is all very bad put yourself in miss crawford s place fanny consider what it would be to act amelia with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be it would be ungenerous it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so fanny you hesitate
p01674_A,01674,A,i am sorry for miss crawford but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle it will be such a triumph to the others
p01675_A,01675,A,they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i act but however triumph there certainly will be and i must brave it but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business of limiting the exhibition of concentrating our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this concession i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs rushworth and the grants will not this be worth gaining
p01676_A,01676,A,yes it will be a great point
p01677_A,01677,A,but still it has not your approbation can you mention any other measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good
p01678_A,01678,A,no i cannot think of anything else
p01679_A,01679,A,give me your approbation then fanny i am not comfortable without it
p01680_A,01680,A,oh cousin
p01681_A,01681,A,if you are against me i ought to distrust myself and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss crawford s feelings
p01682_A,01682,A,no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her
p01683_A,01683,A,she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night it gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill
p01684_A,01684,A,she was very kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared
p01685_A,01685,A,perhaps fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now perhaps you may persuade her
p01686_A,01686,A,no she is quite determined she certainly will not act
p01687_A,01687,A,i rather wonder julia is not in love with henry
p01688_A,01688,A,i dare say she is i imagine both sisters are
p01689_A,01689,A,both no no that must not be do not give him a hint of it think of mr rushworth
p01690_A,01690,A,you had better tell miss bertram to think of mr rushworth it may do her some good i often think of mr rushworth s property and independence and wish them in other hands but i never think of him a man might represent the county with such an estate a man might escape a profession and represent the county
p01691_A,01691,A,i dare say he will be in parliament soon when sir thomas comes i dare say he will be in for some borough but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet
p01692_A,01692,A,sir thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home do you remember hawkins browne s address to tobacco in imitation of pope i will parody them will not that do mrs grant everything seems to depend upon sir thomas s return
p01693_A,01693,A,you will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family i assure you i do not think we do so well without him he has a fine dignified manner which suits the head of such a house and keeps everybody in their place lady bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home and nobody else can keep mrs norris in order but mary do not fancy that maria bertram cares for henry i am sure julia does not or she would not have flirted as she did last night with mr yates and though he and maria are very good friends i think she likes sotherton too well to be inconstant
p01694_A,01694,A,i would not give much for mr rushworth s chance if henry stept in before the articles were signed
p01695_A,01695,A,come fanny these are fine times for you but you must not be always walking from one room to the other and doing the lookings on at your ease in this way i want you here i have been slaving myself till i can hardly stand to contrive mr rushworth s cloak without sending for any more satin and now i think you may give me your help in putting it together there are but three seams you may do them in a trice it would be lucky for me if i had nothing but the executive part to do you are best off i can tell you but if nobody did more than you we should not get on very fast
p01696_A,01696,A,one cannot wonder sister that fanny should be delighted it is all new to her you know you and i used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am i still and as soon as i am a little more at leisure i mean to look in at their rehearsals too what is the play about fanny you have never told me
p01697_A,01697,A,oh sister pray do not ask her now for fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time it is about lovers vows
p01698_A,01698,A,i believe there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once
p01699_A,01699,A,am i right yes this is the east room my dear miss price i beg your pardon but i have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help thank you i am quite warm very warm allow me to stay here a little while and do have the goodness to hear me my third act i have brought my book and if you would but rehearse it with me i should be so obliged i came here to day intending to rehearse it with edmund by ourselves against the evening but he is not in the way and if he were i do not think i could go through it with him till i have hardened myself a little for really there is a speech or two you will be so good won t you have you ever happened to look at the part i mean here it is i did not think much of it at first but upon my word there look at that speech and that and that how am i ever to look him in the face and say such things could you do it but then he is your cousin which makes all the difference you must rehearse it with me that i may fancy you him and get on by degrees you have a look of his sometimes
p01700_A,01700,A,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p01701_A,01701,A,if miss price would be so good as to read the part
p01702_A,01702,A,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p01703_A,01703,A,you have only to read the part
p01704_A,01704,A,my father is come he is in the hall at this moment i need not be afraid of appearing before him
p01705_A,01705,A,but where is fanny why do not i see my little fanny
p01706_A,01706,A,sure my dear sir thomas a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea do have a basin of soup
p01707_A,01707,A,still the same anxiety for everybody s comfort my dear mrs norris but indeed i would rather have nothing but tea
p01708_A,01708,A,well then lady bertram suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry baddeley a little he seems behindhand to night
p01709_A,01709,A,how do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting
p01710_A,01710,A,indeed and what have you been acting
p01711_A,01711,A,oh they ll tell you all about it
p01712_A,01712,A,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p01713_A,01713,A,something must be done
p01714_A,01714,A,it is time to think of our visitors where did you leave miss crawford fanny
p01715_A,01715,A,i come from your theatre i found myself in it rather unexpectedly its vicinity to my own room but in every respect indeed it took me by surprise as i had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character it appears a neat job however as far as i could judge by candlelight and does my friend christopher jackson credit
p01716_A,01716,A,this was in fact the origin of our acting my friend yates brought the infection from ecclesford and it spread as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly it was like treading old ground again
p01717_A,01717,A,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence
p01718_A,01718,A,my indulgence shall be given sir but without any other rehearsal i come home to be happy and indulgent mr and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield do you find them agreeable acquaintance
p01719_A,01719,A,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p01720_A,01720,A,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p01721_A,01721,A,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p01722_A,01722,A,if i had not been active and made a point of being introduced to his mother and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit i am as certain as i sit here that nothing would have come of it for mr rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle but i left no stone unturned i was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister and at last i did persuade her you know the distance to sotherton it was in the middle of winter and the roads almost impassable but i did persuade her
p01723_A,01723,A,i know how great how justly great your influence is with lady bertram and her children and am the more concerned that it should not have been
p01724_A,01724,A,my dear sir thomas if you had seen the state of the roads that day i thought we should never have got through them though we had the four horses of course and poor old coachman would attend us out of his great love and kindness though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which i had been doctoring him for ever since michaelmas i cured him at last but he was very bad all the winter and this was such a day i could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture he was putting on his wig so i said coachman you had much better not go your lady and i shall be very safe you know how steady stephen is and charles has been upon the leaders so often now that i am sure there is no fear but however i soon found it would not do he was bent upon going and as i hate to be worrying and officious i said no more but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt and when we got into the rough lanes about stoke where what with frost and snow upon beds of stones it was worse than anything you can imagine i was quite in an agony about him and then the poor horses too to see them straining away you know how i always feel for the horses and when we got to the bottom of sandcroft hill what do you think i did you will laugh at me but i got out and walked up i did indeed it might not be saving them much but it was something and i could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals i caught a dreadful cold but that i did not regard my object was accomplished in the visit
p01725_A,01725,A,i hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it there is nothing very striking in mr rushworth s manners but i was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting he seemed to feel exactly as one could wish
p01726_A,01726,A,i am sorry you are going but as to our play that is all over entirely at an end the painter was sent off yesterday and very little will remain of the theatre to morrow i knew how that would be from the first it is early for bath you will find nobody there
p01727_A,01727,A,it is about my uncle s usual time
p01728_A,01728,A,when do you think of going
p01729_A,01729,A,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day
p01730_A,01730,A,whose stables do you use at bath
p01731_A,01731,A,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father
p01732_A,01732,A,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home
p01733_A,01733,A,i believe you are right fanny i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were than assuming a new character the novelty was in their being lively yet how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give i have been feeling as if we had never lived so before
p01734_A,01734,A,i suppose i am graver than other people the evenings do not appear long to me i love to hear my uncle talk of the west indies i could listen to him for an hour together it entertains me more than many other things have done but then i am unlike other people i dare say
p01735_A,01735,A,why should you dare say that do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet but when did you or anybody ever get a compliment from me fanny go to my father if you want to be complimented he will satisfy you ask your uncle what he thinks and you will hear compliments enough and though they may be chiefly on your person you must put up with it and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time your uncle thinks you very pretty dear fanny and that is the long and the short of the matter anybody but myself would have made something more of it and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before but the truth is that your uncle never did admire you till now and now he does your complexion is so improved and you have gained so much countenance and your figure nay fanny do not turn away about it it is but an uncle if you cannot bear an uncle s admiration what is to become of you you must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at you must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman
p01736_A,01736,A,oh don t talk so don t talk so
p01737_A,01737,A,your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect and i only wish you would talk to him more you are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle
p01738_A,01738,A,but i do talk to him more than i used i am sure i do did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last night
p01739_A,01739,A,i did and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others it would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther
p01740_A,01740,A,and i longed to do it but there was such a dead silence and while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word or seeming at all interested in the subject i did not like i thought it would appear as if i wanted to set myself off at their expense by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel
p01741_A,01741,A,miss crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect we were talking of you at the parsonage and those were her words she has great discernment i know nobody who distinguishes characters better for so young a woman it is remarkable she certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long and with regard to some others i can perceive from occasional lively hints the unguarded expressions of the moment that she could define many as accurately did not delicacy forbid it i wonder what she thinks of my father she must admire him as a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manners but perhaps having seen him so seldom his reserve may be a little repulsive could they be much together i feel sure of their liking each other he would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers i wish they met more frequently i hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side
p01742_A,01742,A,she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension and sir thomas s wishing just at first to be only with his family is so very natural that she can argue nothing from that after a little while i dare say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way allowing for the difference of the time of year
p01743_A,01743,A,this is the first october that she has passed in the country since her infancy i do not call tunbridge or cheltenham the country and november is a still more serious month and i can see that mrs grant is very anxious for her not finding mansfield dull as winter comes on
p01744_A,01744,A,to morrow i think my uncle dines at sotherton and you and mr bertram too we shall be quite a small party at home i hope my uncle may continue to like mr rushworth
p01745_A,01745,A,shall i play to you now what will you have another quarter of an hour and we shall see how it will be do not run away the first moment of its holding up those clouds look alarming
p01746_A,01746,A,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south
p01747_A,01747,A,south or north i know a black cloud when i see it and you must not set forward while it is so threatening and besides i want to play something more to you a very pretty piece and your cousin edmund s prime favourite you must stay and hear your cousin s favourite
p01748_A,01748,A,this is pretty very pretty every time i come into this shrubbery i am more struck with its growth and beauty three years ago this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field never thought of as anything or capable of becoming anything and now it is converted into a walk and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament and perhaps in another three years we may be forgetting almost forgetting what it was before how wonderful how very wonderful the operations of time and the changes of the human mind if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences the memory is sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered and so weak and at others again so tyrannic so beyond control we are to be sure a miracle every way but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out it may seem impertinent in me to praise but i must admire the taste mrs grant has shewn in all this there is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk not too much attempted
p01749_A,01749,A,yes it does very well for a place of this sort one does not think of extent here and between ourselves till i came to mansfield i had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery or anything of the kind
p01750_A,01750,A,i am so glad to see the evergreens thrive my uncle s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general the evergreen how beautiful how welcome how wonderful the evergreen when one thinks of it how astonishing a variety of nature in some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence you will think me rhapsodising but when i am out of doors especially when i am sitting out of doors i am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain one cannot fix one s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy
p01751_A,01751,A,to say the truth i am something like the famous doge at the court of lewis xiv and may declare that i see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it if anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home that i should be spending month after month here as i have done i certainly should not have believed them i have now been here nearly five months and moreover the quietest five months i ever passed
p01752_A,01752,A,too quiet for you i believe
p01753_A,01753,A,i should have thought so theoretically myself but take it all and all i never spent so happy a summer but then there is no saying what it may lead to i am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than i had ever expected to be i can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country under certain circumstances very pleasant an elegant moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions continual engagements among them commanding the first society in the neighbourhood looked up to perhaps as leading it even more than those of larger fortune and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a t te t te with the person one feels most agreeable in the world there is nothing frightful in such a picture is there miss price one need not envy the new mrs rushworth with such a home as that
p01754_A,01754,A,envy mrs rushworth come come it would be very un handsome in us to be severe on mrs rushworth for i look forward to our owing her a great many gay brilliant happy hours i expect we shall be all very much at sotherton another year such a match as miss bertram has made is a public blessing for the first pleasures of mr rushworth s wife must be to fill her house and give the best balls in the country
p01755_A,01755,A,ah here he is my sister and mr bertram i am so glad your eldest cousin is gone that he may be mr bertram again there is something in the sound of mr edmund bertram so formal so pitiful so younger brother like that i detest it
p01756_A,01756,A,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections
p01757_A,01757,A,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again
p01758_A,01758,A,perhaps i might have scolded if either of you had been sitting down alone but while you do wrong together i can overlook a great deal
p01759_A,01759,A,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p01760_A,01760,A,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may
p01761_A,01761,A,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little
p01762_A,01762,A,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close
p01763_A,01763,A,the sweets of housekeeping in a country village commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer
p01764_A,01764,A,my dear child commend dr grant to the deanery of westminster or st paul s and i should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be but we have no such people in mansfield what would you have me do
p01765_A,01765,A,oh you can do nothing but what you do already be plagued very often and never lose your temper
p01766_A,01766,A,thank you but there is no escaping these little vexations mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer perhaps on their very account their remoteness and unpunctuality or their exorbitant charges and frauds will be drawing forth bitter lamentations
p01767_A,01767,A,i mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of it certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it
p01768_A,01768,A,you intend to be very rich
p01769_A,01769,A,to be sure do not you do not we all
p01770_A,01770,A,i cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss crawford may chuse her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor
p01771_A,01771,A,by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connexions what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means but i shall not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich
p01772_A,01772,A,your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am anxious for your not looking down on
p01773_A,01773,A,but i do look down upon it if it might have been higher i must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction
p01774_A,01774,A,but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction
p01775_A,01775,A,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago
p01776_A,01776,A,that is not much to the purpose now and as to my being in parliament i believe i must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on no miss crawford there are distinctions which i should be miserable if i thought myself without any chance absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining but they are of a different character
p01777_A,01777,A,and you know what your dinner will be the turkey and i assure you a very fine one for my dear cook insists upon the turkey s being dressed to morrow
p01778_A,01778,A,but why should mrs grant ask fanny how came she to think of asking fanny fanny never dines there you know in this sort of way i cannot spare her and i am sure she does not want to go fanny you do not want to go do you
p01779_A,01779,A,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p01780_A,01780,A,i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked fanny
p01781_A,01781,A,if you cannot do without me ma am
p01782_A,01782,A,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening
p01783_A,01783,A,to be sure so i shall
p01784_A,01784,A,suppose you take my father s opinion ma am
p01785_A,01785,A,that s well thought of so i will edmund i will ask sir thomas as soon as he comes in whether i can do without her
p01786_A,01786,A,as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by fanny that being the first invitation it should be accepted
p01787_A,01787,A,edmund wants her to go but how can i spare her
p01788_A,01788,A,she will be late but what is your difficulty
p01789_A,01789,A,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her
p01790_A,01790,A,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p01791_A,01791,A,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence
p01792_A,01792,A,but can i do without her sir thomas
p01793_A,01793,A,indeed i think you may
p01794_A,01794,A,she always makes tea you know when my sister is not here
p01795_A,01795,A,your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home
p01796_A,01796,A,very well then fanny may go edmund
p01797_A,01797,A,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p01798_A,01798,A,upon my word fanny you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence you ought to be very much obliged to mrs grant for thinking of you and to your aunt for letting you go and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary for i hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way or ever dining out at all and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to you the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me mrs grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you or else it would never have come into her head and you may be very certain that if your cousin julia had been at home you would not have been asked at all oh depend upon it your aunt can do very well without you or you would not be allowed to go i shall be here so you may be quite easy about your aunt and i hope you will have a very agreeable day and find it all mighty delightful but i must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table and i cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as mrs grant should not contrive better and round their enormous great wide table too which fills up the room so dreadfully had the doctor been contented to take my dining table when i came away as anybody in their senses would have done instead of having that absurd new one of his own which is wider literally wider than the dinner table here how infinitely better it would have been and how much more he would have been respected for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere remember that fanny five only five to be sitting round that table however you will have dinner enough on it for ten i dare say the nonsense and folly of people s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves makes me think it right to give you a hint fanny now that you are going into company without any of us and i do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins as if you were dear mrs rushworth or julia that will never do believe me remember wherever you are you must be the lowest and last and though miss crawford is in a manner at home at the parsonage you are not to be taking place of her and as to coming away at night you are to stay just as long as edmund chuses leave him to settle that
p01799_A,01799,A,yes ma am i should not think of anything else
p01800_A,01800,A,fanny at what time would you have the carriage come round
p01801_A,01801,A,my dear sir thomas fanny can walk
p01802_A,01802,A,walk my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year will twenty minutes after four suit you
p01803_A,01803,A,yes sir
p01804_A,01804,A,now i must look at you fanny and tell you how i like you and as well as i can judge by this light you look very nicely indeed what have you got on
p01805_A,01805,A,the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i hope it is not too fine but i thought i ought to wear it as soon as i could and that i might not have such another opportunity all the winter i hope you do not think me too fine
p01806_A,01806,A,so rushworth and his fair bride are at brighton i understand happy man
p01807_A,01807,A,yes they have been there about a fortnight miss price have they not and julia is with them
p01808_A,01808,A,and mr yates i presume is not far off
p01809_A,01809,A,mr yates oh we hear nothing of mr yates i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to mansfield park do you miss price i think my friend julia knows better than to entertain her father with mr yates
p01810_A,01810,A,poor rushworth and his two and forty speeches nobody can ever forget them poor fellow i see him now his toil and his despair well i am much mistaken if his lovely maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her she is too good for him much too good you were mr rushworth s best friend your kindness and patience can never be forgotten your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own he might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness but i may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party it is as a dream a pleasant dream i shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure there was such an interest such an animation such a spirit diffused everybody felt it we were all alive there was employment hope solicitude bustle for every hour of the day always some little objection some little doubt some little anxiety to be got over i never was happier
p01811_A,01811,A,we were unlucky miss price we certainly were very unlucky another week only one other week would have been enough for us i think if we had had the disposal of events if mansfield park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two about the equinox there would have been a difference not that we would have endangered his safety by any tremendous weather but only by a steady contrary wind or a calm i think miss price we would have indulged ourselves with a week s calm in the atlantic at that season
p01812_A,01812,A,as far as i am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough
p01813_A,01813,A,i believe you are right it was more pleasant than prudent we were getting too noisy
p01814_A,01814,A,those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss
p01815_A,01815,A,the most interesting in the world how to make money how to turn a good income into a better dr grant is giving bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon i find he takes orders in a few weeks they were at it in the dining parlour i am glad to hear bertram will be so well off he will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with and earned without much trouble i apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother and as of course he will still live at home it will be all for his menus plaisirs and a sermon at christmas and easter i suppose will be the sum total of sacrifice
p01816_A,01816,A,nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather blank henry if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year
p01817_A,01817,A,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you
p01818_A,01818,A,i shall keep clear of you crawford as long as i can for you would be more likely to disconcert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man
p01819_A,01819,A,and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the intermediate days and what do you think it is
p01820_A,01820,A,to walk and ride with me to be sure
p01821_A,01821,A,not exactly though i shall be happy to do both but that would be exercise only to my body and i must take care of my mind besides that would be all recreation and indulgence without the wholesome alloy of labour and i do not like to eat the bread of idleness no my plan is to make fanny price in love with me
p01822_A,01822,A,fanny price nonsense no no you ought to be satisfied with her two cousins
p01823_A,01823,A,but i cannot be satisfied without fanny price without making a small hole in fanny price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modest not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express and then her air her manner her tout ensemble is so indescribably improved she must be grown two inches at least since october
p01824_A,01824,A,phoo phoo this is only because there were no tall women to compare her with and because she has got a new gown and you never saw her so well dressed before she is just what she was in october believe me the truth is that she was the only girl in company for you to notice and you must have a somebody i have always thought her pretty not strikingly pretty but pretty enough as people say a sort of beauty that grows on one her eyes should be darker but she has a sweet smile but as for this wonderful degree of improvement i am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having nobody else to look at and therefore if you do set about a flirtation with her you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly
p01825_A,01825,A,i do not quite know what to make of miss fanny i do not understand her i could not tell what she would be at yesterday what is her character is she solemn is she queer is she prudish why did she draw back and look so grave at me i could hardly get her to speak i never was so long in company with a girl in my life trying to entertain her and succeed so ill never met with a girl who looked so grave on me i must try to get the better of this her looks say i will not like you i am determined not to like you and i say she shall
p01826_A,01826,A,foolish fellow and so this is her attraction after all this it is her not caring about you which gives her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces i do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy a little love perhaps may animate and do her good but i will not have you plunge her deep for she is as good a little creature as ever lived and has a great deal of feeling
p01827_A,01827,A,it can be but for a fortnight and if a fortnight can kill her she must have a constitution which nothing could save no i will not do her any harm dear little soul i only want her to look kindly on me to give me smiles as well as blushes to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are and be all animation when i take it and talk to her to think as i think be interested in all my possessions and pleasures try to keep me longer at mansfield and feel when i go away that she shall be never happy again i want nothing more
p01828_A,01828,A,moderation itself i can have no scruples now well you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself for we are a great deal together
p01829_A,01829,A,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything
p01830_A,01830,A,i hope your ladyship is pleased with the game
p01831_A,01831,A,oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr crawford does all the rest
p01832_A,01832,A,bertram i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck for i never do wrong without gaining by it i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentleman s house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone s throw of the said knoll and church i found myself in short in thornton lacey
p01833_A,01833,A,it sounds like it but which way did you turn after passing sewell s farm
p01834_A,01834,A,i answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions though were i to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour you would never be able to prove that it was not thornton lacey for such it certainly was
p01835_A,01835,A,you inquired then
p01836_A,01836,A,no i never inquire but i told a man mending a hedge that it was thornton lacey and he agreed to it
p01837_A,01837,A,you have a good memory i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place well and how did you like what you saw
p01838_A,01838,A,very much indeed you are a lucky fellow there will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable
p01839_A,01839,A,no no not so bad as that the farmyard must be moved i grant you but i am not aware of anything else the house is by no means bad and when the yard is removed there may be a very tolerable approach to it
p01840_A,01840,A,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas
p01841_A,01841,A,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me
p01842_A,01842,A,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p01843_A,01843,A,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p01844_A,01844,A,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p01845_A,01845,A,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p01846_A,01846,A,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins
p01847_A,01847,A,i should be very happy aunt but brighton is almost by beachey head and if i could get so far i could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that poor scrubby midshipman as i am
p01848_A,01848,A,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p01849_A,01849,A,i want to be your neighbour sir thomas as you have perhaps heard me telling miss price may i hope for your acquiescence and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant
p01850_A,01850,A,certainly sir i have no idea but of residence but crawford though i refuse you as a tenant come to me as a friend consider the house as half your own every winter and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring
p01851_A,01851,A,we shall be the losers his going though only eight miles will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle but i should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less it is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject mr crawford but a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent edmund might in the common phrase do the duty of thornton that is he might read prayers and preach without giving up mansfield park he might ride over every sunday to a house nominally inhabited and go through divine service he might be the clergyman of thornton lacey every seventh day for three or four hours if that would content him but it will not he knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey and that if he does not live among his parishioners and prove himself by constant attention their well wisher and friend he does very little either for their good or his own i repeat again that thornton lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which i should not be happy to wait on mr crawford as occupier
p01852_A,01852,A,this is the assembly night if i were at portsmouth i should be at it perhaps
p01853_A,01853,A,but you do not wish yourself at portsmouth william
p01854_A,01854,A,no fanny that i do not i shall have enough of portsmouth and of dancing too when i cannot have you and i do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly for i might not get a partner the portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission one might as well be nothing as a midshipman one is nothing indeed you remember the gregorys they are grown up amazing fine girls but they will hardly speak to me because lucy is courted by a lieutenant
p01855_A,01855,A,oh shame shame but never mind it william it is not worth minding it is no reflection on you it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced more or less in their time you must think of that you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor s share like bad weather and hard living only with this advantage that there will be an end to it that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure when you are a lieutenant only think william when you are a lieutenant how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind
p01856_A,01856,A,i begin to think i shall never be a lieutenant fanny everybody gets made but me
p01857_A,01857,A,oh my dear william do not talk so do not be so desponding my uncle says nothing but i am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made he knows as well as you do of what consequence it is
p01858_A,01858,A,are you fond of dancing fanny
p01859_A,01859,A,yes very only i am soon tired
p01860_A,01860,A,i should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance have you never any balls at northampton i should like to see you dance and i d dance with you if you would for nobody would know who i was here and i should like to be your partner once more we used to jump about together many a time did not we when the hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good dancer in my way but i dare say you are a better is not fanny a very good dancer sir
p01861_A,01861,A,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p01862_A,01862,A,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p01863_A,01863,A,come fanny fanny what are you about we are going do not you see your aunt is going quick quick i cannot bear to keep good old wilcox waiting you should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and edmund and william
p01864_A,01864,A,i do not like william that you should leave northamptonshire without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at northampton your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue would be too much for your aunt i believe we must not think of a northampton ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if
p01865_A,01865,A,ah my dear sir thomas i knew what was coming i knew what you were going to say if dear julia were at home or dearest mrs rushworth at sotherton to afford a reason an occasion for such a thing you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at mansfield i know you would if they were at home to grace the ball a ball you would have this very christmas thank your uncle william thank your uncle
p01866_A,01866,A,but what shall you have by way of necklace shall not you wear your brother s cross you see what a collection i have more by half than i ever use or think of i do not offer them as new i offer nothing but an old necklace you must forgive the liberty and oblige me
p01867_A,01867,A,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were
p01868_A,01868,A,fanny i beg your pardon for being here i came to look for you and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand you will find the beginning of a note to yourself but i can now speak my business which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle a chain for william s cross you ought to have had it a week ago but there has been a delay from my brother s not being in town by several days so soon as i expected and i have only just now received it at northampton i hope you will like the chain itself fanny i endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste but at any rate i know you will be kind to my intentions and consider it as it really is a token of the love of one of your oldest friends
p01869_A,01869,A,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond
p01870_A,01870,A,if that is all you have to say fanny
p01871_A,01871,A,no no it is not i want to consult you oh this is beautiful indeed this is the very thing precisely what i wished for this is the only ornament i have ever had a desire to possess it will exactly suit my cross they must and shall be worn together it comes too in such an acceptable moment oh cousin you do not know how acceptable it is
p01872_A,01872,A,my dear fanny you feel these things a great deal too much i am most happy that you like the chain and that it should be here in time for to morrow but your thanks are far beyond the occasion believe me i have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours no i can safely say i have no pleasure so complete so unalloyed it is without a drawback but what is it that you want to consult me about return the necklace no my dear fanny upon no account it would be mortifying her severely there can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of
p01873_A,01873,A,if it had been given to me in the first instance i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it when it is not wanted
p01874_A,01874,A,she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no difference for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to prevent you from keeping it no doubt it is handsomer than mine and fitter for a ballroom
p01875_A,01875,A,no it is not handsomer not at all handsomer in its way and for my purpose not half so fit the chain will agree with william s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace
p01876_A,01876,A,for one night fanny for only one night if it be a sacrifice i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort miss crawford s attentions to you have been not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could be but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the necklace as you are engaged to do to morrow evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for commoner occasions this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences resulting principally from situation no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise between the two dearest objects i have on earth
p01877_A,01877,A,fanny you look tired and fagged fanny you have been walking too far
p01878_A,01878,A,no i have not been out at all
p01879_A,01879,A,then you have had fatigues within doors which are worse you had better have gone out i come from dr grant s you may guess my errand there fanny i wished to engage miss crawford for the two first dances yes she is engaged to me but she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me she is not serious i think i hope i am sure she is not serious but i would rather not hear it she never has danced with a clergyman she says and she never will for my own sake i could wish there had been no ball just at i mean not this very week this very day to morrow i leave home
p01880_A,01880,A,i am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you this ought to be a day of pleasure my uncle meant it so
p01881_A,01881,A,oh yes yes and it will be a day of pleasure it will all end right i am only vexed for a moment in fact it is not that i consider the ball as ill timed what does it signify but fanny you know what all this means you see how it is and could tell me perhaps better than i could tell you how and why i am vexed let me talk to you a little you are a kind kind listener i have been pained by her manner this morning and cannot get the better of it i know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own but the influence of her former companions makes her seem gives to her conversation to her professed opinions sometimes a tinge of wrong she does not think evil but she speaks it speaks it in playfulness and though i know it to be playfulness it grieves me to the soul
p01882_A,01882,A,the effect of education
p01883_A,01883,A,yes that uncle and aunt they have injured the finest mind for sometimes fanny i own to you it does appear more than manner it appears as if the mind itself was tainted
p01884_A,01884,A,if you only want me as a listener cousin i will be as useful as i can but i am not qualified for an adviser do not ask advice of me i am not competent
p01885_A,01885,A,you are right fanny to protest against such an office but you need not be afraid it is a subject on which i should never ask advice it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked and few i imagine do ask it but when they want to be influenced against their conscience i only want to talk to you
p01886_A,01886,A,one thing more excuse the liberty but take care how you talk to me do not tell me anything now which hereafter you may be sorry for the time may come
p01887_A,01887,A,dearest fanny you are all considerate thought but it is unnecessary here the time will never come no such time as you allude to will ever come i begin to think it most improbable the chances grow less and less and even if it should there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of for i can never be ashamed of my own scruples and if they are removed it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had you are the only being upon earth to whom i should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her you can bear me witness fanny that i have never been blinded how many a time have we talked over her little errors you need not fear me i have almost given up every serious idea of her but i must be a blockhead indeed if whatever befell me i could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude
p01888_A,01888,A,yes she looks very well i sent chapman to her
p01889_A,01889,A,yes she does look very well chapman helped her to dress i sent chapman to her
p01890_A,01890,A,poor fanny how soon she is knocked up why the sport is but just begun i hope we shall keep it up these two hours how can you be tired so soon
p01891_A,01891,A,so soon my good friend it is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours
p01892_A,01892,A,well then fanny you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me
p01893_A,01893,A,oh william
p01894_A,01894,A,what did she think of being up before you set off
p01895_A,01895,A,oh yes sir i must get up and breakfast with him it will be the last time you know the last morning
p01896_A,01896,A,you had better not he is to have breakfasted and be gone by half past nine mr crawford i think you call for him at half past nine
p01897_A,01897,A,i cannot think what is the matter with me i feel quite stupid it must be sitting up so late last night fanny you must do something to keep me awake i cannot work fetch the cards i feel so very stupid
p01898_A,01898,A,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p01899_A,01899,A,we miss our two young men and there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to edmund we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done
p01900_A,01900,A,yes but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home sir thomas i have been thinking and i am very glad we took fanny as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it
p01901_A,01901,A,very true we shew fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face she is now a very valuable companion if we have been kind to her she is now quite as necessary to us
p01902_A,01902,A,yes and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her
p01903_A,01903,A,she will never leave us i hope till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here
p01904_A,01904,A,and how do you like your cousin edmund s staying away so long being the only young person at home i consider you as the greatest sufferer you must miss him does his staying longer surprise you
p01905_A,01905,A,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it
p01906_A,01906,A,perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of it is the general way all young men do
p01907_A,01907,A,he did not the only time he went to see mr owen before
p01908_A,01908,A,he finds the house more agreeable now he is a very a very pleasing young man himself and i cannot help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before i go to london as will now undoubtedly be the case i am looking for henry every day and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at mansfield i should like to have seen him once more i confess but you must give my compliments to him yes i think it must be compliments is not there a something wanted miss price in our language a something between compliments and and love to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together so many months acquaintance but compliments may be sufficient here was his letter a long one does he give you much account of what he is doing is it christmas gaieties that he is staying for
p01909_A,01909,A,i only heard a part of the letter it was to my uncle but i believe it was very short indeed i am sure it was but a few lines all that i heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer and that he had agreed to do so a few days longer or some days longer i am not quite sure which
p01910_A,01910,A,oh if he wrote to his father but i thought it might have been to lady bertram or you but if he wrote to his father no wonder he was concise who could write chat to sir thomas if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have heard of balls and parties he would have sent you a description of everything and everybody how many miss owens are there
p01911_A,01911,A,three grown up
p01912_A,01912,A,are they musical
p01913_A,01913,A,i do not at all know i never heard
p01914_A,01914,A,that is the first question you know which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are all very accomplished and pleasing and one very pretty there is a beauty in every family it is a regular thing two play on the pianoforte and one on the harp and all sing or would sing if they were taught or sing all the better for not being taught or something like it
p01915_A,01915,A,i know nothing of the miss owens
p01916_A,01916,A,you know nothing and you care less as people say never did tone express indifference plainer indeed how can one care for those one has never seen well when your cousin comes back he will find mansfield very quiet all the noisy ones gone your brother and mine and myself i do not like the idea of leaving mrs grant now the time draws near she does not like my going
p01917_A,01917,A,you cannot doubt your being missed by many you will be very much missed
p01918_A,01918,A,oh yes missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away that is there is a great difference felt but i am not fishing don t compliment me if i am missed it will appear i may be discovered by those who want to see me i shall not be in any doubtful or distant or unapproachable region the miss owens suppose you were to have one of the miss owens settled at thornton lacey how should you like it stranger things have happened i dare say they are trying for it and they are quite in the right for it would be a very pretty establishment for them i do not at all wonder or blame them it is everybody s duty to do as well for themselves as they can sir thomas bertram s son is somebody and now he is in their own line their father is a clergyman and their brother is a clergyman and they are all clergymen together he is their lawful property he fairly belongs to them you don t speak fanny miss price you don t speak but honestly now do not you rather expect it than otherwise
p01919_A,01919,A,no i do not expect it at all
p01920_A,01920,A,not at all i wonder at that but i dare say you know exactly i always imagine you are perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all or not at present
p01921_A,01921,A,no i do not
p01922_A,01922,A,my dear henry where can you have been all this time sitting with them an hour and a half
p01923_A,01923,A,yes mary i could not get away sooner fanny looked so lovely i am quite determined mary my mind is entirely made up will it astonish you no you must be aware that i am quite determined to marry fanny price yes mary i am fairly caught you know with what idle designs i began but this is the end of them i have i flatter myself made no inconsiderable progress in her affections but my own are entirely fixed
p01924_A,01924,A,lucky lucky girl what a match for her my dearest henry this must be my first feeling but my second which you shall have as sincerely is that i approve your choice from my soul and foresee your happiness as heartily as i wish and desire it you will have a sweet little wife all gratitude and devotion exactly what you deserve what an amazing match for her mrs norris often talks of her luck what will she say now the delight of all the family indeed and she has some true friends in it how they will rejoice but tell me all about it talk to me for ever when did you begin to think seriously about her ah my dear henry and this is what took you to london this was your business you chose to consult the admiral before you made up your mind
p01925_A,01925,A,when fanny is known to him he will doat on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet
p01926_A,01926,A,what are you waiting for
p01927_A,01927,A,for for very little more than opportunity mary she is not like her cousins but i think i shall not ask in vain
p01928_A,01928,A,oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse
p01929_A,01929,A,i could so wholly and absolutely confide in her and that is what i want
p01930_A,01930,A,the more i think of it the more am i convinced that you are doing quite right and though i should never have selected fanny price as the girl most likely to attach you i am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed you will both find your good in it
p01931_A,01931,A,it was bad very bad in me against such a creature but i did not know her then and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head i will make her very happy mary happier than she has ever yet been herself or ever seen anybody else i will not take her from northamptonshire i shall let everingham and rent a place in this neighbourhood perhaps stanwix lodge i shall let a seven years lease of everingham i am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word i could name three people now who would give me my own terms and thank me
p01932_A,01932,A,ha settle in northamptonshire that is pleasant then we shall be all together
p01933_A,01933,A,you must give us more than half your time i cannot admit mrs grant to have an equal claim with fanny and myself for we shall both have a right in you fanny will be so truly your sister
p01934_A,01934,A,that s right and in london of course a house of your own no longer with the admiral my dearest henry the advantage to you of getting away from the admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life you are not sensible of the gain for your regard for him has blinded you but in my estimation your marrying early may be the saving of you to have seen you grow like the admiral in word or deed look or gesture would have broken my heart
p01935_A,01935,A,well well we do not think quite alike here the admiral has his faults but he is a very good man and has been more than a father to me few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much you must not prejudice fanny against him i must have them love one another
p01936_A,01936,A,henry i think so highly of fanny price that if i could suppose the next mrs crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor the very name i would prevent the marriage if possible but i know you i know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women and that even when you ceased to love she would yet find in you the liberality and good breeding of a gentleman
p01937_A,01937,A,had you seen her this morning mary attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt s stupidity working with her and for her her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman s service and all this with such unpretending gentleness so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command her hair arranged as neatly as it always is and one little curl falling forward as she wrote which she now and then shook back and in the midst of all this still speaking at intervals to me or listening and as if she liked to listen to what i said had you seen her so mary you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing
p01938_A,01938,A,my dearest henry how glad i am to see you so much in love it quite delights me but what will mrs rushworth and julia say
p01939_A,01939,A,i care neither what they say nor what they feel they will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me that can attach a man of sense i wish the discovery may do them any good and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness they will be angry mrs rushworth will be very angry it will be a bitter pill to her that is like other bitter pills it will have two moments ill flavour and then be swallowed and forgotten for i am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women s though i was the object of them yes mary my fanny will feel a difference indeed a daily hourly difference in the behaviour of every being who approaches her and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that i am the doer of it that i am the person to give the consequence so justly her due now she is dependent helpless friendless neglected forgotten
p01940_A,01940,A,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her
p01941_A,01941,A,i must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them i will not talk of my own happiness great as it is for i think only of yours compared with you who has a right to be happy i have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this morning but there has not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the subject i will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having it finished while i was in london i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands i left the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pass before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him i would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend as this day does prove it now i may say that even i could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together
p01942_A,01942,A,now william would be able to keep himself which would make a vast difference to his uncle for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle and indeed it would make some difference in her presents too she was very glad that she had given william what she did at parting very glad indeed that it had been in her power without material inconvenience just at that time to give him something rather considerable that is for her with her limited means for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin she knew he must be at some expense that he would have many things to buy though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap but she was very glad she had contributed her mite towards it
p01943_A,01943,A,i am glad you gave him something considerable for i gave him only 10
p01944_A,01944,A,indeed upon my word he must have gone off with his pockets well lined and at no expense for his journey to london either
p01945_A,01945,A,sir thomas told me 10 would be enough
p01946_A,01946,A,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them
p01947_A,01947,A,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny
p01948_A,01948,A,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line
p01949_A,01949,A,oh yes certainly i will write directly
p01950_A,01950,A,you cannot think i mean to hurry you you cannot think i have any such object do not hurry yourself i entreat
p01951_A,01951,A,why have you no fire to day
p01952_A,01952,A,i am not cold sir i never sit here long at this time of year
p01953_A,01953,A,but you have a fire in general
p01954_A,01954,A,no sir
p01955_A,01955,A,how comes this about here must be some mistake i understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable in your bedchamber i know you cannot have a fire here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified it is highly unfit for you to sit be it only half an hour a day without a fire you are not strong you are chilly your aunt cannot be aware of this i understand i understand your aunt norris has always been an advocate and very judiciously for young people s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences but there should be moderation in everything she is also very hardy herself which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others and on another account too i can perfectly comprehend i know what her sentiments have always been the principle was good in itself but it may have been and i believe has been carried too far in your case i am aware that there has been sometimes in some points a misplaced distinction but i think too well of you fanny to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account you have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part and judging partially by the event you will take in the whole of the past you will consider times persons and probabilities and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which seemed to be your lot though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary it was kindly meant and of this you may be assured that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed i am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you by failing at any time to treat your aunt norris with the respect and attention that are due to her but enough of this sit down my dear i must speak to you for a few minutes but i will not detain you long you are not aware perhaps that i have had a visitor this morning i had not been long in my own room after breakfast when mr crawford was shewn in his errand you may probably conjecture and now fanny having performed one part of my commission and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory i may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs where though i cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself i must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to mr crawford as you have perhaps foreseen is yet in the house he is in my room and hoping to see you there
p01956_A,01956,A,oh no sir i cannot indeed i cannot go down to him mr crawford ought to know he must know that i told him enough yesterday to convince him he spoke to me on this subject yesterday and i told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me and quite out of my power to return his good opinion
p01957_A,01957,A,i do not catch your meaning out of your power to return his good opinion what is all this i know he spoke to you yesterday and as far as i understand received as much encouragement to proceed as a well judging young woman could permit herself to give i was very much pleased with what i collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion it shewed a discretion highly to be commended but now when he has made his overtures so properly and honourably what are your scruples now
p01958_A,01958,A,you are mistaken sir you are quite mistaken how could mr crawford say such a thing i gave him no encouragement yesterday on the contrary i told him i cannot recollect my exact words but i am sure i told him that i would not listen to him that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect and that i begged him never to talk to me in that manner again i am sure i said as much as that and more and i should have said still more if i had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously but i did not like to be i could not bear to be imputing more than might be intended i thought it might all pass for nothing with him
p01959_A,01959,A,am i to understand that you mean to refuse mr crawford
p01960_A,01960,A,yes sir
p01961_A,01961,A,refuse him
p01962_A,01962,A,yes sir
p01963_A,01963,A,refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason
p01964_A,01964,A,i i cannot like him sir well enough to marry him
p01965_A,01965,A,you must have been aware you must have been some time aware of a particularity in mr crawford s manners to you this cannot have taken you by surprise you must have observed his attentions and though you always received them very properly i have no accusation to make on that head i never perceived them to be unpleasant to you i am half inclined to think fanny that you do not quite know your own feelings
p01966_A,01966,A,oh yes sir indeed i do his attentions were always what i did not like
p01967_A,01967,A,this is beyond me this requires explanation young as you are and having seen scarcely any one it is hardly possible that your affections no no i know that is quite out of the question quite impossible well there is nothing more to be said independently of the interest which mr crawford s choice seemed to justify his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me i am an advocate for early marriages where there are means in proportion and would have every young man with a sufficient income settle as soon after four and twenty as he can this is so much my opinion that i am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son your cousin mr bertram is to marry early but at present as far as i can judge matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts i wish he were more likely to fix edmund i consider from his dispositions and habits as much more likely to marry early than his brother he indeed i have lately thought has seen the woman he could love which i am convinced my eldest son has not am i right do you agree with me my dear
p01968_A,01968,A,yes sir
p01969_A,01969,A,have you any reason child to think ill of mr crawford s temper
p01970_A,01970,A,no sir
p01971_A,01971,A,it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had fanny as i think my behaviour must have shewn formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to england i had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence but you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you without even asking their advice you have shewn yourself very very different from anything that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family of your parents your brothers and sisters never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they might be benefited how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations and are in a wild fit of folly throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you fanny that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr crawford s estate or a tenth part of his merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr crawford sought julia s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rushworth and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this immediately and peremptorily and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect you are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but fanny if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude
p01972_A,01972,A,i am very sorry i am very sorry indeed
p01973_A,01973,A,sorry yes i hope you are sorry and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day s transactions
p01974_A,01974,A,if it were possible for me to do otherwise but i am so perfectly convinced that i could never make him happy and that i should be miserable myself
p01975_A,01975,A,well well child dry up your tears there is no use in these tears they can do no good you must now come downstairs with me mr crawford has been kept waiting too long already you must give him your own answer we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments which unfortunately for himself he certainly has imbibed i am totally unequal to it mr crawford is gone he has just left me i need not repeat what has passed i do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling by an account of what he has felt suffice it that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding heart and temper upon my representation of what you were suffering he immediately and with the greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see you for the present of course it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone be it only for five minutes a request too natural a claim too just to be denied but there is no time fixed perhaps to morrow or whenever your spirits are composed enough for the present you have only to tranquillise yourself check these tears they do but exhaust you if as i am willing to suppose you wish to shew me any observance you will not give way to these emotions but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind i advise you to go out the air will do you good go out for an hour on the gravel you will have the shrubbery to yourself and will be the better for air and exercise and fanny i shall make no mention below of what has passed i shall not even tell your aunt bertram there is no occasion for spreading the disappointment say nothing about it yourself
p01976_A,01976,A,if i had known you were going out i should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for nanny which i have since to my very great inconvenience been obliged to go and carry myself i could very ill spare the time and you might have saved me the trouble if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out it would have made no difference to you i suppose whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house
p01977_A,01977,A,i recommended the shrubbery to fanny as the driest place
p01978_A,01978,A,sir thomas wishes to speak with you ma am in his own room
p01979_A,01979,A,stay stay fanny what are you about where are you going don t be in such a hurry depend upon it it is not you who are wanted depend upon it it is me but you are so very eager to put yourself forward what should sir thomas want you for it is me baddeley you mean i am coming this moment you mean me baddeley i am sure sir thomas wants me not miss price
p01980_A,01980,A,well fanny i have seen mr crawford again and learn from him exactly how matters stand between you he is a most extraordinary young man and whatever be the event you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common character though young as you are and little acquainted with the transient varying unsteady nature of love as it generally exists you cannot be struck as i am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of this sort against discouragement with him it is entirely a matter of feeling he claims no merit in it perhaps is entitled to none yet having chosen so well his constancy has a respectable stamp had his choice been less unexceptionable i should have condemned his persevering
p01981_A,01981,A,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power
p01982_A,01982,A,well fanny well fanny i have had a very agreeable surprise this morning i must just speak of it once i told sir thomas i must once and then i shall have done i give you joy my dear niece humph we certainly are a handsome family
p01983_A,01983,A,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p01984_A,01984,A,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps
p01985_A,01985,A,let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship i shall find it immediately
p01986_A,01986,A,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well
p01987_A,01987,A,it will be a favourite i believe from this hour but i do not think i have had a volume of shakespeare in my hand before since i was fifteen i once saw henry the eighth acted or i have heard of it from somebody who did i am not certain which but shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how it is a part of an englishman s constitution his thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere one is intimate with him by instinct no man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately
p01988_A,01988,A,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent
p01989_A,01989,A,sir you do me honour
p01990_A,01990,A,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p01991_A,01991,A,do you ma am no no that will never be your ladyship is quite mistaken no theatre at everingham oh no
p01992_A,01992,A,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p01993_A,01993,A,are you sure you did not speak i saw your lips move i fancied you might be going to tell me i ought to be more attentive and not allow my thoughts to wander are not you going to tell me so
p01994_A,01994,A,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing
p01995_A,01995,A,what did that shake of the head mean what was it meant to express disapprobation i fear but of what what had i been saying to displease you did you think me speaking improperly lightly irreverently on the subject only tell me if i was only tell me if i was wrong i want to be set right nay nay i entreat you for one moment put down your work what did that shake of the head mean
p01996_A,01996,A,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can
p01997_A,01997,A,do i astonish you do you wonder is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand i will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner all that gives me an interest in what you look and do and excites my present curiosity i will not leave you to wonder long you shook your head at my acknowledging that i should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy yes that was the word constancy i am not afraid of the word i would spell it read it write it with anybody i see nothing alarming in the word did you think i ought
p01998_A,01998,A,perhaps sir perhaps sir i thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment
p01999_A,01999,A,i am come to walk with you fanny shall i it is a long while since we have had a comfortable walk together but fanny in order to have a comfortable walk something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together you must talk to me i know you have something on your mind i know what you are thinking of you cannot suppose me uninformed am i to hear of it from everybody but fanny herself
p02000_A,02000,A,if you hear of it from everybody cousin there can be nothing for me to tell
p02001_A,02001,A,not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief
p02002_A,02002,A,i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel
p02003_A,02003,A,do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford s proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here
p02004_A,02004,A,oh no but i thought you blamed me i thought you were against me this is such a comfort
p02005_A,02005,A,this comfort you might have had sooner fanny had you sought it but how could you possibly suppose me against you how could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love were i even careless in general on such matters how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake
p02006_A,02006,A,my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you
p02007_A,02007,A,as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford s is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and tender hearted and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for
p02008_A,02008,A,oh never never never he never will succeed with me
p02009_A,02009,A,never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self
p02010_A,02010,A,i mean that i think i never shall as far as the future can be answered for i think i never shall return his regard
p02011_A,02011,A,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference
p02012_A,02012,A,we are so totally unlike we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if i could like him there never were two people more dissimilar we have not one taste in common we should be miserable
p02013_A,02013,A,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct
p02014_A,02014,A,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over
p02015_A,02015,A,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open
p02016_A,02016,A,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous
p02017_A,02017,A,very possibly no wonder nothing could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest
p02018_A,02018,A,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions
p02019_A,02019,A,julia i have heard before from some one of his being in love with julia but i could never see anything of it and fanny though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by crawford and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encouragement a man like crawford lively and it may be a little unthinking might be led on to there could be nothing very striking because it is clear that he had no pretensions his heart was reserved for you and i must say that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him unspoilt by his uncle it proves him in short everything that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not
p02020_A,02020,A,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects
p02021_A,02021,A,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything
p02022_A,02022,A,i would not engage in such a charge in such an office of high responsibility
p02023_A,02023,A,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity
p02024_A,02024,A,was mrs grant in the room then
p02025_A,02025,A,yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you fanny till crawford and dr grant came in
p02026_A,02026,A,it is above a week since i saw miss crawford
p02027_A,02027,A,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart
p02028_A,02028,A,i knew she would be very angry with me
p02029_A,02029,A,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality
p02030_A,02030,A,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time
p02031_A,02031,A,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me
p02032_A,02032,A,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply
p02033_A,02033,A,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life
p02034_A,02034,A,you were near staying there
p02035_A,02035,A,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough
p02036_A,02036,A,you spent your time pleasantly there
p02037_A,02037,A,yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if i did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in mansfield again
p02038_A,02038,A,the miss owens you liked them did not you
p02039_A,02039,A,i must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere sad sad girl i do not know when i shall have done scolding you ha am i here again the east room once only was i in this room before once only before do you remember it i came to rehearse your cousin came too and we had a rehearsal you were our audience and prompter a delightful rehearsal i shall never forget it here we were just in this part of the room here was your cousin here was i here were the chairs oh why will such things ever pass away the scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable the subject of it so very very what shall i say he was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me i think i see him now trying to be as demure and composed as anhalt ought through the two long speeches when two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state matrimony may be called a happy life i suppose no time can ever wear out the impression i have of his looks and voice as he said those words it was curious very curious that we should have such a scene to play if i had the power of recalling any one week of my existence it should be that week that acting week say what you would fanny it should be that for i never knew such exquisite happiness in any other his sturdy spirit to bend as it did oh it was sweet beyond expression but alas that very evening destroyed it all that very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle poor sir thomas who was glad to see you yet fanny do not imagine i would now speak disrespectfully of sir thomas though i certainly did hate him for many a week no i do him justice now he is just what the head of such a family should be nay in sober sadness i believe i now love you all i have had a little fit since i came into this room as you may perceive but it is over now so let us sit down and be comfortable for as to scolding you fanny which i came fully intending to do i have not the heart for it when it comes to the point good gentle fanny when i think of this being the last time of seeing you for i do not know how long i feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you i hate to leave you i shall see no one half so amiable where i am going who says we shall not be sisters i know we shall i feel that we are born to be connected and those tears convince me that you feel it too dear fanny
p02040_A,02040,A,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend
p02041_A,02041,A,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it perfectly
p02042_A,02042,A,do you mean then that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand oh miss crawford that was not fair
p02043_A,02043,A,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes
p02044_A,02044,A,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing
p02045_A,02045,A,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph
p02046_A,02046,A,i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander by can judge of
p02047_A,02047,A,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission
p02048_A,02048,A,oh yes how very very kind of him
p02049_A,02049,A,the thrush is gone out of harbour please sir and one of the officers has been here to
p02050_A,02050,A,oh my dear william how glad i am to see you but have you heard about the thrush she is gone out of harbour already three days before we had any thought of it and i do not know what i am to do about sam s things they will never be ready in time for she may have her orders to morrow perhaps it takes me quite unawares and now you must be off for spithead too campbell has been here quite in a worry about you and now what shall we do i thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you and here everything comes upon me at once
p02051_A,02051,A,to be sure i had much rather she had stayed in harbour that i might have sat a few hours with you in comfort but as there is a boat ashore i had better go off at once and there is no help for it whereabouts does the thrush lay at spithead near the canopus but no matter here s fanny in the parlour and why should we stay in the passage come mother you have hardly looked at your own dear fanny yet
p02052_A,02052,A,poor dears how tired you must both be and now what will you have i began to think you would never come betsey and i have been watching for you this half hour and when did you get anything to eat and what would you like to have now i could not tell whether you would be for some meat or only a dish of tea after your journey or else i would have got something ready and now i am afraid campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak and we have no butcher at hand it is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street we were better off in our last house perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got then betsey my dear run into the kitchen and see if rebecca has put the water on and tell her to bring in the tea things as soon as she can i wish we could get the bell mended but betsey is a very handy little messenger dear me what a sad fire we have got and i dare say you are both starved with cold draw your chair nearer my dear i cannot think what rebecca has been about i am sure i told her to bring some coals half an hour ago susan you should have taken care of the fire
p02053_A,02053,A,ha welcome back my boy glad to see you have you heard the news the thrush went out of harbour this morning sharp is the word you see by g you are just in time the doctor has been here inquiring for you he has got one of the boats and is to be off for spithead by six so you had better go with him i have been to turner s about your mess it is all in a way to be done i should not wonder if you had your orders to morrow but you cannot sail with this wind if you are to cruise to the westward and captain walsh thinks you will certainly have a cruise to the westward with the elephant by g i wish you may but old scholey was saying just now that he thought you would be sent first to the texel well well we are ready whatever happens but by g you lost a fine sight by not being here in the morning to see the thrush go out of harbour i would not have been out of the way for a thousand pounds old scholey ran in at breakfast time to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out i jumped up and made but two steps to the platform if ever there was a perfect beauty afloat she is one and there she lays at spithead and anybody in england would take her for an eight and twenty i was upon the platform two hours this afternoon looking at her she lays close to the endymion between her and the cleopatra just to the eastward of the sheer hulk
p02054_A,02054,A,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p02055_A,02055,A,her year i am sure i hope i shall be rid of her before she has staid a year for that will not be up till november servants are come to such a pass my dear in portsmouth that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year i have no hope of ever being settled and if i was to part with rebecca i should only get something worse and yet i do not think i am a very difficult mistress to please and i am sure the place is easy enough for there is always a girl under her and i often do half the work myself
p02056_A,02056,A,what have you got there my love come and shew it to me
p02057_A,02057,A,come girls come fan come sue take care of yourselves keep a sharp lookout
p02058_A,02058,A,you have been here a month i think
p02059_A,02059,A,no not quite a month it is only four weeks to morrow since i left mansfield
p02060_A,02060,A,you are a most accurate and honest reckoner i should call that a month
p02061_A,02061,A,i did not arrive here till tuesday evening
p02062_A,02062,A,and it is to be a two months visit is not
p02063_A,02063,A,yes my uncle talked of two months i suppose it will not be less
p02064_A,02064,A,and how are you to be conveyed back again who comes for you
p02065_A,02065,A,i do not know i have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt perhaps i may be to stay longer it may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months end
p02066_A,02066,A,i wish you were not so tired i wish i left you in stronger health is there anything i can do for you in town i have half an idea of going into norfolk again soon i am not satisfied about maddison i am sure he still means to impose on me if possible and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill which i design for somebody else i must come to an understanding with him i must make him know that i will not be tricked on the south side of everingham any more than on the north that i will be master of my own property i was not explicit enough with him before the mischief such a man does on an estate both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor is inconceivable i have a great mind to go back into norfolk directly and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from maddison is a clever fellow i do not wish to displace him provided he does not try to displace me but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me and worse than simple to let him give me a hard hearted griping fellow for a tenant instead of an honest man to whom i have given half a promise already would it not be worse than simple shall i go do you advise it
p02067_A,02067,A,i advise you know very well what is right
p02068_A,02068,A,yes when you give me your opinion i always know what is right your judgment is my rule of right
p02069_A,02069,A,oh no do not say so we have all a better guide in ourselves if we would attend to it than any other person can be good bye i wish you a pleasant journey to morrow
p02070_A,02070,A,is there nothing i can do for you in town
p02071_A,02071,A,nothing i am much obliged to you
p02072_A,02072,A,have you no message for anybody
p02073_A,02073,A,my love to your sister if you please and when you see my cousin my cousin edmund i wish you would be so good as to say that i suppose i shall soon hear from him
p02074_A,02074,A,certainly and if he is lazy or negligent i will write his excuses myself
p02075_A,02075,A,what s the name of your great cousins in town fan
p02076_A,02076,A,rushworth sir
p02077_A,02077,A,and don t they live in wimpole street
p02078_A,02078,A,yes sir
p02079_A,02079,A,then there s the devil to pay among them that s all there much good may such fine relations do you i don t know what sir thomas may think of such matters he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less but by g if she belonged to me i d give her the rope s end as long as i could stand over her a little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things
p02080_A,02080,A,it is a mistake sir it must be a mistake it cannot be true it must mean some other people
p02081_A,02081,A,it might be all a lie but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way that there was no answering for anybody
p02082_A,02082,A,said she i could not answer but i believe my looks spoke she felt reproved sometimes how quick to feel with a graver look and voice she then added so she began but how she went on fanny is not fit is hardly fit to be repeated to you i cannot recall all her words i would not dwell upon them if i could their substance was great anger at the folly of each she reprobated her brother s folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never cared for to do what must lose him the woman he adored but still more the folly of poor maria in sacrificing such a situation plunging into such difficulties under the idea of being really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear guess what i must have felt to hear the woman whom no harsher name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to canvass it no reluctance no horror no feminine shall i say no modest loathings this is what the world does for where fanny shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed spoilt spoilt i will tell you everything and then have done for ever she saw it only as folly and that folly stamped only by exposure the want of common discretion of caution his going down to richmond for the whole time of her being at twickenham her putting herself in the power of a servant it was the detection in short oh fanny it was the detection not the offence which she reprobated it was the imprudence which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her
p02083_A,02083,A,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty
p02084_A,02084,A,nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on began to talk of you yes then she began to talk of you regretting as well she might the loss of such a there she spoke very rationally but she has always done justice to you said she my dearest fanny i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent if you do give me but a look a word and i have done thank god now fanny she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty to the lessons of affliction and immediately left the room i had gone a few steps fanny when i heard the door open behind me said she i looked back said she with a smile but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since sometimes for a moment regretted that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived equally in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience fanny this has been the greatest relief and now we will have done we were all disposed to wonder but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise and warm affection yet even here there was alloy a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim could you have believed it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened cruelty do you call it we differ there no hers is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined everybody else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would hers are faults of principle fanny of blunted delicacy and a corrupted vitiated mind perhaps it is best for me since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so
p02085_A,02085,A,did you
p02086_A,02086,A,yes when i left her i told her so
p02087_A,02087,A,how long were you together
p02088_A,02088,A,i wish you could dance my dear i wish you could get a partner it would have been very shocking to have it torn would not it it is such a delicate muslin for my part i have not seen anything i like so well in the whole room i assure you
p02089_A,02089,A,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p02090_A,02090,A,yes my dear it is very uncomfortable indeed
p02091_A,02091,A,what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party
p02092_A,02092,A,aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here
p02093_A,02093,A,i wish we had any it would be somebody to go to
p02094_A,02094,A,very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now
p02095_A,02095,A,had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see
p02096_A,02096,A,no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid
p02097_A,02097,A,no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you must know somebody
p02098_A,02098,A,well miss morland i hope you have had an agreeable ball
p02099_A,02099,A,very agreeable indeed
p02100_A,02100,A,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p02101_A,02101,A,i have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here i have not yet asked you how long you have been in bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the upper rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether i have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars if you are i will begin directly
p02102_A,02102,A,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p02103_A,02103,A,no trouble i assure you madam have you been long in bath madam
p02104_A,02104,A,why should you be surprised sir
p02105_A,02105,A,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam
p02106_A,02106,A,never sir
p02107_A,02107,A,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms
p02108_A,02108,A,yes sir i was there last monday
p02109_A,02109,A,have you been to the theatre
p02110_A,02110,A,yes sir i was at the play on tuesday
p02111_A,02111,A,to the concert
p02112_A,02112,A,yes sir on wednesday
p02113_A,02113,A,and are you altogether pleased with bath
p02114_A,02114,A,yes i like it very well
p02115_A,02115,A,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow
p02116_A,02116,A,my journal
p02117_A,02117,A,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense
p02118_A,02118,A,indeed i shall say no such thing
p02119_A,02119,A,shall i tell you what you ought to say
p02120_A,02120,A,if you please
p02121_A,02121,A,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say
p02122_A,02122,A,but perhaps i keep no journal
p02123_A,02123,A,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal
p02124_A,02124,A,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side
p02125_A,02125,A,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars
p02126_A,02126,A,and what are they
p02127_A,02127,A,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar
p02128_A,02128,A,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way
p02129_A,02129,A,my dear catherine do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard
p02130_A,02130,A,that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam
p02131_A,02131,A,do you understand muslins sir
p02132_A,02132,A,particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin
p02133_A,02133,A,men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir
p02134_A,02134,A,i hope i am madam
p02135_A,02135,A,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown
p02136_A,02136,A,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p02137_A,02137,A,how can you be so
p02138_A,02138,A,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p02139_A,02139,A,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p02140_A,02140,A,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p02141_A,02141,A,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory
p02142_A,02142,A,i was not thinking of anything
p02143_A,02143,A,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me
p02144_A,02144,A,well then i will not
p02145_A,02145,A,how excessively like her brother miss morland is
p02146_A,02146,A,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p02147_A,02147,A,my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age
p02148_A,02148,A,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p02149_A,02149,A,oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho
p02150_A,02150,A,yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil
p02151_A,02151,A,are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know
p02152_A,02152,A,oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world
p02153_A,02153,A,dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you
p02154_A,02154,A,have you indeed how glad i am what are they all
p02155_A,02155,A,i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time
p02156_A,02156,A,yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid
p02157_A,02157,A,yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it
p02158_A,02158,A,scold them do you scold them for not admiring her
p02159_A,02159,A,yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men
p02160_A,02160,A,oh dear how can you say so
p02161_A,02161,A,i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings
p02162_A,02162,A,but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again
p02163_A,02163,A,not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so
p02164_A,02164,A,no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it
p02165_A,02165,A,it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels
p02166_A,02166,A,no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way
p02167_A,02167,A,sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume
p02168_A,02168,A,it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining
p02169_A,02169,A,do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know
p02170_A,02170,A,but it does not signify if they do
p02171_A,02171,A,signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance
p02172_A,02172,A,are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me
p02173_A,02173,A,oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair
p02174_A,02174,A,i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark
p02175_A,02175,A,very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description
p02176_A,02176,A,betray you what do you mean
p02177_A,02177,A,nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up and which way are they gone one was a very good looking young man
p02178_A,02178,A,they went towards the church yard
p02179_A,02179,A,well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it
p02180_A,02180,A,only perhaps we may overtake the two young men
p02181_A,02181,A,oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat
p02182_A,02182,A,but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all
p02183_A,02183,A,i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them oh these odious gigs how i detest them delightful mr morland and my brother
p02184_A,02184,A,how long do you think we have been running it from tetbury miss morland
p02185_A,02185,A,i do not know the distance
p02186_A,02186,A,i know it must be five and twenty by the time we have been doing it it is now half after one we drove out of the inn yard at tetbury as the town clock struck eleven and i defy any man in england to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness that makes it exactly twenty five
p02187_A,02187,A,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p02188_A,02188,A,ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can
p02189_A,02189,A,he does look very hot to be sure
p02190_A,02190,A,hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland
p02191_A,02191,A,i am sure i cannot guess at all
p02192_A,02192,A,curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine
p02193_A,02193,A,and i am sure i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
p02194_A,02194,A,neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash
p02195_A,02195,A,that was very good natured of you
p02196_A,02196,A,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p02197_A,02197,A,my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland
p02198_A,02198,A,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p02199_A,02199,A,i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day
p02200_A,02200,A,thank you
p02201_A,02201,A,i will drive you up lansdown hill tomorrow
p02202_A,02202,A,thank you but will not your horse want rest
p02203_A,02203,A,rest he has only come three and twenty miles today all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here
p02204_A,02204,A,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p02205_A,02205,A,forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown tomorrow mind i am engaged
p02206_A,02206,A,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p02207_A,02207,A,a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you
p02208_A,02208,A,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p02209_A,02209,A,udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation
p02210_A,02210,A,i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting
p02211_A,02211,A,not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in them
p02212_A,02212,A,udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe
p02213_A,02213,A,no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant
p02214_A,02214,A,i suppose you mean camilla
p02215_A,02215,A,yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it
p02216_A,02216,A,i have never read it
p02217_A,02217,A,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p02218_A,02218,A,well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe
p02219_A,02219,A,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p02220_A,02220,A,he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family
p02221_A,02221,A,very very much indeed isabella particularly
p02222_A,02222,A,i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine may be proud of
p02223_A,02223,A,indeed i am i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there
p02224_A,02224,A,because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she
p02225_A,02225,A,yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath
p02226_A,02226,A,i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you
p02227_A,02227,A,yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
p02228_A,02228,A,my dear creature i am afraid i must leave you your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin i know you will not mind my going away and i dare say john will be back in a moment and then you may easily find me out good bye my dear love
p02229_A,02229,A,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p02230_A,02230,A,well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health
p02231_A,02231,A,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p02232_A,02232,A,thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout
p02233_A,02233,A,that circumstance must give great encouragement
p02234_A,02234,A,at last i have got you my dearest creature i have been looking for you this hour what could induce you to come into this set when you knew i was in the other i have been quite wretched without you
p02235_A,02235,A,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p02236_A,02236,A,so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people
p02237_A,02237,A,look at that young lady with the white beads round her head it is mr tilney s sister
p02238_A,02238,A,oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you
p02239_A,02239,A,but what is all this whispering about what is going on
p02240_A,02240,A,there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter
p02241_A,02241,A,and is that likely to satisfy me do you think
p02242_A,02242,A,well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable i tell you mr morland i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners
p02243_A,02243,A,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p02244_A,02244,A,nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it
p02245_A,02245,A,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p02246_A,02246,A,well my dear i hope you have had an agreeable partner
p02247_A,02247,A,very agreeable madam
p02248_A,02248,A,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p02249_A,02249,A,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p02250_A,02250,A,no where is he
p02251_A,02251,A,he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you
p02252_A,02252,A,where can he be
p02253_A,02253,A,ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked you he is a very agreeable young man
p02254_A,02254,A,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p02255_A,02255,A,well miss morland i suppose you and i are to stand up and jig it together again
p02256_A,02256,A,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p02257_A,02257,A,well miss morland here i am have you been waiting long we could not come before the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street how do you do mrs allen a famous ball last night was not it come miss morland be quick for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off they want to get their tumble over
p02258_A,02258,A,what do you mean where are you all going to
p02259_A,02259,A,going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down
p02260_A,02260,A,something was said about it i remember but really i did not expect you
p02261_A,02261,A,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p02262_A,02262,A,well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go
p02263_A,02263,A,you will not be frightened miss morland if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him old allen is as rich as a jew is not he old allen the man you are with
p02264_A,02264,A,oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich
p02265_A,02265,A,and no children at all
p02266_A,02266,A,no not any
p02267_A,02267,A,a famous thing for his next heirs he is your godfather is not he
p02268_A,02268,A,my godfather no
p02269_A,02269,A,but you are always very much with them
p02270_A,02270,A,yes very much
p02271_A,02271,A,aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now
p02272_A,02272,A,his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night
p02273_A,02273,A,lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of this that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all
p02274_A,02274,A,i cannot believe it
p02275_A,02275,A,oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help
p02276_A,02276,A,and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford
p02277_A,02277,A,oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way mine is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there
p02278_A,02278,A,yes it does give a notion and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much you do not really think mr thorpe that james s gig will break down
p02279_A,02279,A,break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds
p02280_A,02280,A,good heavens then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is
p02281_A,02281,A,well my dear here you are and i hope you have had a pleasant airing
p02282_A,02282,A,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p02283_A,02283,A,so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going
p02284_A,02284,A,you have seen mrs thorpe then
p02285_A,02285,A,yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce
p02286_A,02286,A,did you see anybody else of our acquaintance
p02287_A,02287,A,yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her
p02288_A,02288,A,did you indeed and did they speak to you
p02289_A,02289,A,yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family
p02290_A,02290,A,and what did she tell you of them
p02291_A,02291,A,oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else
p02292_A,02292,A,did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from
p02293_A,02293,A,yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse
p02294_A,02294,A,and are mr and mrs tilney in bath
p02295_A,02295,A,yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died
p02296_A,02296,A,and is mr tilney my partner the only son
p02297_A,02297,A,oh heavens my beloved catherine have i got you at last now mr morland i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age but i need not ask you for you look delightfully you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody i assure you my brother is quite in love with you already and as for mr tilney but that is a settled thing even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now his coming back to bath makes it too plain oh what would not i give to see him i really am quite wild with impatience my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world she saw him this morning you know you must introduce him to me is he in the house now look about for heaven s sake i assure you i can hardly exist till i see him
p02298_A,02298,A,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p02299_A,02299,A,oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it
p02300_A,02300,A,no indeed i should not
p02301_A,02301,A,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p02302_A,02302,A,how well your brother dances
p02303_A,02303,A,henry yes he does dance very well
p02304_A,02304,A,he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe you cannot think how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away
p02305_A,02305,A,when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us
p02306_A,02306,A,that never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith
p02307_A,02307,A,yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes
p02308_A,02308,A,i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty
p02309_A,02309,A,not very
p02310_A,02310,A,he never comes to the pump room i suppose
p02311_A,02311,A,yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father
p02312_A,02312,A,i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow
p02313_A,02313,A,perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall
p02314_A,02314,A,heyday miss morland what is the meaning of this i thought you and i were to dance together
p02315_A,02315,A,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p02316_A,02316,A,that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously
p02317_A,02317,A,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p02318_A,02318,A,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p02319_A,02319,A,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p02320_A,02320,A,but they are such very different things
p02321_A,02321,A,that you think they cannot be compared together
p02322_A,02322,A,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour
p02323_A,02323,A,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this
p02324_A,02324,A,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them
p02325_A,02325,A,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison
p02326_A,02326,A,no indeed i never thought of that
p02327_A,02327,A,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose
p02328_A,02328,A,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with
p02329_A,02329,A,and is that to be my only security alas alas
p02330_A,02330,A,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody
p02331_A,02331,A,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before
p02332_A,02332,A,yes quite more so indeed
p02333_A,02333,A,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks
p02334_A,02334,A,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months
p02335_A,02335,A,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer
p02336_A,02336,A,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there
p02337_A,02337,A,you are not fond of the country
p02338_A,02338,A,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another
p02339_A,02339,A,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country
p02340_A,02340,A,do i
p02341_A,02341,A,do you not
p02342_A,02342,A,i do not believe there is much difference
p02343_A,02343,A,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long
p02344_A,02344,A,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen
p02345_A,02345,A,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here
p02346_A,02346,A,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath
p02347_A,02347,A,oh dear i do believe it will be wet
p02348_A,02348,A,i thought how it would be
p02349_A,02349,A,no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve
p02350_A,02350,A,perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty
p02351_A,02351,A,oh that will not signify i never mind dirt
p02352_A,02352,A,no i know you never mind dirt
p02353_A,02353,A,it comes on faster and faster
p02354_A,02354,A,so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet
p02355_A,02355,A,there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella
p02356_A,02356,A,they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time
p02357_A,02357,A,it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry
p02358_A,02358,A,anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable you will not be able to go my dear
p02359_A,02359,A,i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather
p02360_A,02360,A,always thought it would clear up
p02361_A,02361,A,make haste make haste put on your hat this moment there is no time to be lost we are going to bristol how d ye do mrs allen
p02362_A,02362,A,my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston
p02363_A,02363,A,i doubt our being able to do so much
p02364_A,02364,A,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p02365_A,02365,A,blaize castle what is that
p02366_A,02366,A,the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see
p02367_A,02367,A,what is it really a castle an old castle
p02368_A,02368,A,the oldest in the kingdom
p02369_A,02369,A,but is it like what one reads of
p02370_A,02370,A,exactly the very same
p02371_A,02371,A,but now really are there towers and long galleries
p02372_A,02372,A,by dozens
p02373_A,02373,A,then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go
p02374_A,02374,A,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p02375_A,02375,A,i cannot go because i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon
p02376_A,02376,A,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p02377_A,02377,A,i do not know indeed
p02378_A,02378,A,well i saw him at that moment turn up the lansdown road driving a smart looking girl
p02379_A,02379,A,did you indeed
p02380_A,02380,A,did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too
p02381_A,02381,A,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p02382_A,02382,A,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p02383_A,02383,A,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p02384_A,02384,A,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p02385_A,02385,A,yes yes every hole and corner
p02386_A,02386,A,but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by
p02387_A,02387,A,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p02388_A,02388,A,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p02389_A,02389,A,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p02390_A,02390,A,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p02391_A,02391,A,who where
p02392_A,02392,A,on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now
p02393_A,02393,A,we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on today your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round
p02394_A,02394,A,if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own
p02395_A,02395,A,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p02396_A,02396,A,and why cannot he afford it
p02397_A,02397,A,because he has not money enough
p02398_A,02398,A,and whose fault is that
p02399_A,02399,A,do not be so dull my dearest creature you will quite break my heart it was amazingly shocking to be sure but the tilneys were entirely to blame why were not they more punctual it was dirty indeed but what did that signify i am sure john and i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where a friend is concerned that is my disposition and john is just the same he has amazing strong feelings good heavens what a delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never was so happy in my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself
p02400_A,02400,A,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p02401_A,02401,A,quite horrid
p02402_A,02402,A,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p02403_A,02403,A,my dear you tumble my gown
p02404_A,02404,A,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p02405_A,02405,A,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p02406_A,02406,A,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible
p02407_A,02407,A,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence
p02408_A,02408,A,me i take offence
p02409_A,02409,A,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry
p02410_A,02410,A,i angry i could have no right
p02411_A,02411,A,he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you a gentleman like good sort of fellow as ever lived
p02412_A,02412,A,but how came you to know him
p02413_A,02413,A,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath
p02414_A,02414,A,oh nonsense how can you say so
p02415_A,02415,A,and what do you think i said well done general said i i am quite of your mind
p02416_A,02416,A,do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go
p02417_A,02417,A,it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday
p02418_A,02418,A,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p02419_A,02419,A,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p02420_A,02420,A,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p02421_A,02421,A,no no no
p02422_A,02422,A,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p02423_A,02423,A,catherine you must go
p02424_A,02424,A,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p02425_A,02425,A,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p02426_A,02426,A,that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure
p02427_A,02427,A,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p02428_A,02428,A,i hope i am not less so now but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right
p02429_A,02429,A,well i have settled the matter and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience i have been to miss tilney and made your excuses
p02430_A,02430,A,you have not
p02431_A,02431,A,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p02432_A,02432,A,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p02433_A,02433,A,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p02434_A,02434,A,let her go let her go if she will go
p02435_A,02435,A,well and do you think of going too
p02436_A,02436,A,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p02437_A,02437,A,no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable
p02438_A,02438,A,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p02439_A,02439,A,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p02440_A,02440,A,yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it
p02441_A,02441,A,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p02442_A,02442,A,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p02443_A,02443,A,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p02444_A,02444,A,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p02445_A,02445,A,that is just what i was going to say
p02446_A,02446,A,you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will
p02447_A,02447,A,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p02448_A,02448,A,you have been abroad then
p02449_A,02449,A,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say
p02450_A,02450,A,why not
p02451_A,02451,A,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p02452_A,02452,A,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
p02453_A,02453,A,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p02454_A,02454,A,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion
p02455_A,02455,A,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p02456_A,02456,A,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home
p02457_A,02457,A,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p02458_A,02458,A,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p02459_A,02459,A,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p02460_A,02460,A,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p02461_A,02461,A,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p02462_A,02462,A,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p02463_A,02463,A,that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you
p02464_A,02464,A,yes i am fond of history
p02465_A,02465,A,i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books
p02466_A,02466,A,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p02467_A,02467,A,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it
p02468_A,02468,A,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p02469_A,02469,A,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words
p02470_A,02470,A,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p02471_A,02471,A,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london
p02472_A,02472,A,indeed and of what nature
p02473_A,02473,A,that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet
p02474_A,02474,A,good heaven where could you hear of such a thing
p02475_A,02475,A,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p02476_A,02476,A,you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect
p02477_A,02477,A,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p02478_A,02478,A,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p02479_A,02479,A,riot what riot
p02480_A,02480,A,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p02481_A,02481,A,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p02482_A,02482,A,i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them
p02483_A,02483,A,no doubt but that is no explanation of the present
p02484_A,02484,A,what am i to do
p02485_A,02485,A,you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women
p02486_A,02486,A,miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company
p02487_A,02487,A,that is not enough be more serious
p02488_A,02488,A,miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half
p02489_A,02489,A,they set off at eight this morning and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria oh yes maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much
p02490_A,02490,A,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p02491_A,02491,A,yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything nay my beloved sweetest friend compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated
p02492_A,02492,A,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p02493_A,02493,A,you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you
p02494_A,02494,A,it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately
p02495_A,02495,A,morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody
p02496_A,02496,A,indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify
p02497_A,02497,A,oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice
p02498_A,02498,A,i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you
p02499_A,02499,A,for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond
p02500_A,02500,A,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p02501_A,02501,A,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria
p02502_A,02502,A,well miss morland i am come to bid you good bye
p02503_A,02503,A,shall not you be late at devizes
p02504_A,02504,A,a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland i say it is no bad notion
p02505_A,02505,A,i am sure i think it a very good one
p02506_A,02506,A,do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope
p02507_A,02507,A,yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible
p02508_A,02508,A,and then you know i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song
p02509_A,02509,A,may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney today and must now be going home
p02510_A,02510,A,nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me
p02511_A,02511,A,then why do you stay away so long
p02512_A,02512,A,that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you
p02513_A,02513,A,oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you
p02514_A,02514,A,but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable
p02515_A,02515,A,pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you
p02516_A,02516,A,and i hope i hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me
p02517_A,02517,A,oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful
p02518_A,02518,A,that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters
p02519_A,02519,A,perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about
p02520_A,02520,A,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p02521_A,02521,A,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil
p02522_A,02522,A,oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day
p02523_A,02523,A,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits
p02524_A,02524,A,how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you
p02525_A,02525,A,unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me
p02526_A,02526,A,that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart
p02527_A,02527,A,but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy
p02528_A,02528,A,oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment
p02529_A,02529,A,well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms
p02530_A,02530,A,and must i go
p02531_A,02531,A,do not you intend it i thought it was all settled
p02532_A,02532,A,nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself
p02533_A,02533,A,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world
p02534_A,02534,A,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions
p02535_A,02535,A,why what do you mean
p02536_A,02536,A,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so
p02537_A,02537,A,i do not understand you
p02538_A,02538,A,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well
p02539_A,02539,A,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible
p02540_A,02540,A,bravo an excellent satire on modern language
p02541_A,02541,A,but pray tell me what you mean
p02542_A,02542,A,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us
p02543_A,02543,A,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid
p02544_A,02544,A,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world
p02545_A,02545,A,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance
p02546_A,02546,A,and did isabella never change her mind before
p02547_A,02547,A,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her
p02548_A,02548,A,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself
p02549_A,02549,A,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general
p02550_A,02550,A,i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still
p02551_A,02551,A,then why did not you
p02552_A,02552,A,oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us
p02553_A,02553,A,he is very handsome indeed
p02554_A,02554,A,it is very charming indeed
p02555_A,02555,A,mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear
p02556_A,02556,A,it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself
p02557_A,02557,A,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p02558_A,02558,A,nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money
p02559_A,02559,A,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p02560_A,02560,A,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p02561_A,02561,A,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p02562_A,02562,A,by the end of another week
p02563_A,02563,A,yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home
p02564_A,02564,A,i am very sorry for it if i had known this before
p02565_A,02565,A,well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend
p02566_A,02566,A,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p02567_A,02567,A,well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable
p02568_A,02568,A,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p02569_A,02569,A,this is my favourite place it is so out of the way
p02570_A,02570,A,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p02571_A,02571,A,psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it
p02572_A,02572,A,you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming
p02573_A,02573,A,i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp
p02574_A,02574,A,but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me
p02575_A,02575,A,oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents
p02576_A,02576,A,no indeed i cannot
p02577_A,02577,A,my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you
p02578_A,02578,A,with me dear isabella
p02579_A,02579,A,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance
p02580_A,02580,A,as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning
p02581_A,02581,A,but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house
p02582_A,02582,A,are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters
p02583_A,02583,A,yes yes there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so
p02584_A,02584,A,i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it
p02585_A,02585,A,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last
p02586_A,02586,A,you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment
p02587_A,02587,A,oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter
p02588_A,02588,A,but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened
p02589_A,02589,A,what always to be watched in person or by proxy
p02590_A,02590,A,psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent
p02591_A,02591,A,i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me
p02592_A,02592,A,my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts
p02593_A,02593,A,if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough
p02594_A,02594,A,do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you i hope your eyes are not tormented now
p02595_A,02595,A,my brother does know it
p02596_A,02596,A,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable
p02597_A,02597,A,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that
p02598_A,02598,A,then you will persuade him to go away
p02599_A,02599,A,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master
p02600_A,02600,A,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable
p02601_A,02601,A,and are you sure it is my brother s doing
p02602_A,02602,A,yes very sure
p02603_A,02603,A,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain
p02604_A,02604,A,is not it the same thing
p02605_A,02605,A,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment
p02606_A,02606,A,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him
p02607_A,02607,A,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick
p02608_A,02608,A,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another
p02609_A,02609,A,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little
p02610_A,02610,A,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother
p02611_A,02611,A,i can have no opinion on that subject
p02612_A,02612,A,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour
p02613_A,02613,A,you are a very close questioner
p02614_A,02614,A,am i i only ask what i want to be told
p02615_A,02615,A,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell
p02616_A,02616,A,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart
p02617_A,02617,A,well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her
p02618_A,02618,A,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go
p02619_A,02619,A,but how can that be are not you with her
p02620_A,02620,A,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there
p02621_A,02621,A,how sorry you must be for that
p02622_A,02622,A,i am always sorry to leave eleanor
p02623_A,02623,A,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable
p02624_A,02624,A,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey
p02625_A,02625,A,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about
p02626_A,02626,A,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry
p02627_A,02627,A,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens
p02628_A,02628,A,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you
p02629_A,02629,A,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure
p02630_A,02630,A,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock
p02631_A,02631,A,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then
p02632_A,02632,A,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room
p02633_A,02633,A,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing
p02634_A,02634,A,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness
p02635_A,02635,A,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way
p02636_A,02636,A,but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth
p02637_A,02637,A,and how might you learn by accident or argument
p02638_A,02638,A,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers
p02639_A,02639,A,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose
p02640_A,02640,A,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within
p02641_A,02641,A,this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude woodston will make but a sombre appearance today
p02642_A,02642,A,is it a pretty place
p02643_A,02643,A,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p02644_A,02644,A,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p02645_A,02645,A,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p02646_A,02646,A,how were mr allen s succession houses worked
p02647_A,02647,A,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p02648_A,02648,A,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p02649_A,02649,A,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now
p02650_A,02650,A,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p02651_A,02651,A,a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary
p02652_A,02652,A,to be sure you must miss him very much
p02653_A,02653,A,a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other
p02654_A,02654,A,was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits her picture i suppose hangs in your father s room
p02655_A,02655,A,our friends from fullerton
p02656_A,02656,A,i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died
p02657_A,02657,A,it remains as it was i suppose
p02658_A,02658,A,yes entirely
p02659_A,02659,A,and how long ago may it be that your mother died
p02660_A,02660,A,she has been dead these nine years
p02661_A,02661,A,you were with her i suppose to the last
p02662_A,02662,A,my father only wanted me to answer a note
p02663_A,02663,A,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p02664_A,02664,A,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine
p02665_A,02665,A,i have been to see your mother s room
p02666_A,02666,A,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there
p02667_A,02667,A,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow
p02668_A,02668,A,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use
p02669_A,02669,A,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride
p02670_A,02670,A,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself
p02671_A,02671,A,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us
p02672_A,02672,A,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage
p02673_A,02673,A,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress
p02674_A,02674,A,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you
p02675_A,02675,A,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly
p02676_A,02676,A,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal
p02677_A,02677,A,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her
p02678_A,02678,A,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin
p02679_A,02679,A,but your father was he afflicted
p02680_A,02680,A,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death
p02681_A,02681,A,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking
p02682_A,02682,A,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting
p02683_A,02683,A,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill
p02684_A,02684,A,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again
p02685_A,02685,A,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p02686_A,02686,A,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why
p02687_A,02687,A,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress
p02688_A,02688,A,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world
p02689_A,02689,A,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story
p02690_A,02690,A,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part
p02691_A,02691,A,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother
p02692_A,02692,A,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice
p02693_A,02693,A,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p02694_A,02694,A,her mother is a very good sort of woman
p02695_A,02695,A,what was her father
p02696_A,02696,A,a lawyer i believe they live at putney
p02697_A,02697,A,are they a wealthy family
p02698_A,02698,A,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p02699_A,02699,A,but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved
p02700_A,02700,A,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p02701_A,02701,A,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p02702_A,02702,A,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p02703_A,02703,A,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p02704_A,02704,A,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before
p02705_A,02705,A,among all the great variety that you have known and studied
p02706_A,02706,A,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it
p02707_A,02707,A,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this
p02708_A,02708,A,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p02709_A,02709,A,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story
p02710_A,02710,A,but he will tell only half of it
p02711_A,02711,A,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days
p02712_A,02712,A,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p02713_A,02713,A,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it
p02714_A,02714,A,go away and why
p02715_A,02715,A,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure
p02716_A,02716,A,oh not seriously
p02717_A,02717,A,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay
p02718_A,02718,A,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify
p02719_A,02719,A,we are not calling it a good house we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow
p02720_A,02720,A,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p02721_A,02721,A,i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste
p02722_A,02722,A,well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage
p02723_A,02723,A,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p02724_A,02724,A,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her
p02725_A,02725,A,it will soon be as if you never had
p02726_A,02726,A,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself
p02727_A,02727,A,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause
p02728_A,02728,A,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her
p02729_A,02729,A,i am persuaded that he never did
p02730_A,02730,A,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him
p02731_A,02731,A,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment
p02732_A,02732,A,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p02733_A,02733,A,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p02734_A,02734,A,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p02735_A,02735,A,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p02736_A,02736,A,good heaven what can be the matter my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand
p02737_A,02737,A,errand to me
p02738_A,02738,A,how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you
p02739_A,02739,A,tis a messenger from woodston
p02740_A,02740,A,you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either
p02741_A,02741,A,my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton
p02742_A,02742,A,it will not be in my power catherine
p02743_A,02743,A,come when you can then monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home
p02744_A,02744,A,ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing
p02745_A,02745,A,have i offended the general
p02746_A,02746,A,alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible
p02747_A,02747,A,i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence
p02748_A,02748,A,i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended
p02749_A,02749,A,oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time
p02750_A,02750,A,i shall see you in the morning you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice
p02751_A,02751,A,no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe
p02752_A,02752,A,i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you
p02753_A,02753,A,my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding
p02754_A,02754,A,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p02755_A,02755,A,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping
p02756_A,02756,A,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p02757_A,02757,A,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p02758_A,02758,A,i really have not patience with the general only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first
p02759_A,02759,A,yes but that did not last long
p02760_A,02760,A,very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening
p02761_A,02761,A,do i oh perfectly
p02762_A,02762,A,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p02763_A,02763,A,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p02764_A,02764,A,her head did not run upon bath much
p02765_A,02765,A,then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger
p02766_A,02766,A,i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat
p02767_A,02767,A,you may see the house from this window sir
p02768_A,02768,A,i must take leave to observe sir walter that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter
p02769_A,02769,A,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd
p02770_A,02770,A,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p02771_A,02771,A,there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description
p02772_A,02772,A,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p02773_A,02773,A,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p02774_A,02774,A,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p02775_A,02775,A,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p02776_A,02776,A,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p02777_A,02777,A,oh certainly
p02778_A,02778,A,yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age
p02779_A,02779,A,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p02780_A,02780,A,and who is admiral croft
p02781_A,02781,A,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p02782_A,02782,A,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p02783_A,02783,A,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p02784_A,02784,A,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p02785_A,02785,A,bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed
p02786_A,02786,A,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p02787_A,02787,A,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p02788_A,02788,A,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p02789_A,02789,A,i cannot possibly do without anne
p02790_A,02790,A,mrs clay never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles
p02791_A,02791,A,there is hardly any personal defect which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to
p02792_A,02792,A,so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning
p02793_A,02793,A,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p02794_A,02794,A,yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning
p02795_A,02795,A,you have had your little boys with you
p02796_A,02796,A,yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad
p02797_A,02797,A,well you will soon be better now you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house
p02798_A,02798,A,i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way
p02799_A,02799,A,you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early
p02800_A,02800,A,i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday
p02801_A,02801,A,my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner
p02802_A,02802,A,dear me what can you possibly have to do
p02803_A,02803,A,a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time
p02804_A,02804,A,oh well but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday
p02805_A,02805,A,did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party
p02806_A,02806,A,oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone
p02807_A,02807,A,i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party
p02808_A,02808,A,nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it where shall we go i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you
p02809_A,02809,A,i have not the smallest objection on that account i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves
p02810_A,02810,A,it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country perhaps you may not have heard that he is married
p02811_A,02811,A,the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour
p02812_A,02812,A,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p02813_A,02813,A,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p02814_A,02814,A,so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday
p02815_A,02815,A,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p02816_A,02816,A,i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing
p02817_A,02817,A,but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy
p02818_A,02818,A,yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day
p02819_A,02819,A,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p02820_A,02820,A,i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday
p02821_A,02821,A,you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies the admiralty entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed
p02822_A,02822,A,phoo phoo what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his
p02823_A,02823,A,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p02824_A,02824,A,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p02825_A,02825,A,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p02826_A,02826,A,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p02827_A,02827,A,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p02828_A,02828,A,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p02829_A,02829,A,oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend
p02830_A,02830,A,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p02831_A,02831,A,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p02832_A,02832,A,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p02833_A,02833,A,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p02834_A,02834,A,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p02835_A,02835,A,nothing to the purpose you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board
p02836_A,02836,A,but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then
p02837_A,02837,A,all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself
p02838_A,02838,A,depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable
p02839_A,02839,A,i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board
p02840_A,02840,A,my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings
p02841_A,02841,A,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p02842_A,02842,A,but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days
p02843_A,02843,A,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p02844_A,02844,A,ay that we shall
p02845_A,02845,A,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p02846_A,02846,A,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p02847_A,02847,A,upon my word it would dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations you know i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross
p02848_A,02848,A,now you are talking nonsense mary it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied
p02849_A,02849,A,i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here
p02850_A,02850,A,they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say
p02851_A,02851,A,i hope the little boy is better
p02852_A,02852,A,walter get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you
p02853_A,02853,A,what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills they talked of coming into this side of the country i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not
p02854_A,02854,A,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p02855_A,02855,A,had you i honour you
p02856_A,02856,A,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p02857_A,02857,A,no no
p02858_A,02858,A,and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance
p02859_A,02859,A,she would have turned back then but for you
p02860_A,02860,A,she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it
p02861_A,02861,A,happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind
p02862_A,02862,A,mary is good natured enough in many respects but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne
p02863_A,02863,A,do you mean that she refused him
p02864_A,02864,A,oh yes certainly
p02865_A,02865,A,when did that happen
p02866_A,02866,A,miss elliot i am sure you are tired do let us have the pleasure of taking you home here is excellent room for three i assure you if we were all like you i believe we might sit four you must indeed you must
p02867_A,02867,A,he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth
p02868_A,02868,A,we had better not talk about it my dear for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before
p02869_A,02869,A,well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other
p02870_A,02870,A,pray can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away
p02871_A,02871,A,yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london
p02872_A,02872,A,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p02873_A,02873,A,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p02874_A,02874,A,there you see just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery
p02875_A,02875,A,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p02876_A,02876,A,miss elliot you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have such company oftener it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part
p02877_A,02877,A,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p02878_A,02878,A,ay true enough only june
p02879_A,02879,A,and not known to him perhaps so soon
p02880_A,02880,A,she is dead she is dead
p02881_A,02881,A,is there no one to help me
p02882_A,02882,A,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p02883_A,02883,A,oh god her father and mother
p02884_A,02884,A,a surgeon
p02885_A,02885,A,true true a surgeon this instant
p02886_A,02886,A,captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found
p02887_A,02887,A,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p02888_A,02888,A,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p02889_A,02889,A,i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house it will be some trial to us both
p02890_A,02890,A,ay a very bad business indeed a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress s head is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly now this must be very bad for you to be coming and finding us here i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad but now do not stand upon ceremony get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it
p02891_A,02891,A,another time sir i thank you not now
p02892_A,02892,A,oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man i do not know what he would be at we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart broken man as captain benwick
p02893_A,02893,A,now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is oh he talks of you in such terms
p02894_A,02894,A,i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you at all
p02895_A,02895,A,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p02896_A,02896,A,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p02897_A,02897,A,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p02898_A,02898,A,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p02899_A,02899,A,any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me
p02900_A,02900,A,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p02901_A,02901,A,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p02902_A,02902,A,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p02903_A,02903,A,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p02904_A,02904,A,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p02905_A,02905,A,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p02906_A,02906,A,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p02907_A,02907,A,you will not like him i will answer for it
p02908_A,02908,A,i hope i shall remember in future not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays
p02909_A,02909,A,a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place
p02910_A,02910,A,how is mary looking the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day
p02911_A,02911,A,oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas
p02912_A,02912,A,the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view
p02913_A,02913,A,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p02914_A,02914,A,no nothing
p02915_A,02915,A,merely gowland
p02916_A,02916,A,no nothing at all
p02917_A,02917,A,it was an acquaintance worth having
p02918_A,02918,A,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p02919_A,02919,A,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p02920_A,02920,A,yes we shall indeed be known to be related to them i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them
p02921_A,02921,A,pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance
p02922_A,02922,A,well i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place
p02923_A,02923,A,and she besides nursing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise she always takes the right time for applying everybody s heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour s leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know one s species better one likes to hear what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat
p02924_A,02924,A,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p02925_A,02925,A,westgate buildings and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty
p02926_A,02926,A,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p02927_A,02927,A,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p02928_A,02928,A,she sees nothing to blame in it on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith
p02929_A,02929,A,i am no match maker as you well know being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one
p02930_A,02930,A,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p02931_A,02931,A,what is this the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant
p02932_A,02932,A,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p02933_A,02933,A,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p02934_A,02934,A,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p02935_A,02935,A,have they any acquaintance here
p02936_A,02936,A,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p02937_A,02937,A,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p02938_A,02938,A,ha is it you thank you thank you this is treating me like a friend here i am you see staring at a picture i can never get by this shop without stopping but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built i would not venture over a horsepond in it well now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be of any use
p02939_A,02939,A,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p02940_A,02940,A,that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm that s right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is
p02941_A,02941,A,did you say that you had something to tell me sir
p02942_A,02942,A,yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick
p02943_A,02943,A,a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick
p02944_A,02944,A,well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for
p02945_A,02945,A,i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man and i understand that he bears an excellent character
p02946_A,02946,A,oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice
p02947_A,02947,A,indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please
p02948_A,02948,A,well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross
p02949_A,02949,A,i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man
p02950_A,02950,A,not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him
p02951_A,02951,A,certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort
p02952_A,02952,A,yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think poor frederick now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath
p02953_A,02953,A,i am much obliged to you but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking
p02954_A,02954,A,but it rains
p02955_A,02955,A,oh very little nothing that i regard
p02956_A,02956,A,though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair
p02957_A,02957,A,by all means only tell me all about it when you do come who is your party well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me to morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you
p02958_A,02958,A,how do you do
p02959_A,02959,A,i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time it was a frightful hour a frightful day the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery
p02960_A,02960,A,certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both sides good principles and good temper
p02961_A,02961,A,yes but there i think ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not
p02962_A,02962,A,you were a good while at lyme i think
p02963_A,02963,A,about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire
p02964_A,02964,A,i should very much like to see lyme again
p02965_A,02965,A,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p02966_A,02966,A,this is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar
p02967_A,02967,A,yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof
p02968_A,02968,A,i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient
p02969_A,02969,A,i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman
p02970_A,02970,A,for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next
p02971_A,02971,A,perhaps i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of
p02972_A,02972,A,indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family
p02973_A,02973,A,a well looking man a very well looking man
p02974_A,02974,A,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p02975_A,02975,A,no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch
p02976_A,02976,A,the little durands were there i conclude with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed they never miss a concert
p02977_A,02977,A,yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room
p02978_A,02978,A,the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them
p02979_A,02979,A,i do not know i do not think they were
p02980_A,02980,A,old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course
p02981_A,02981,A,no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little
p02982_A,02982,A,oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond
p02983_A,02983,A,but i ought to have looked about me more
p02984_A,02984,A,no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation
p02985_A,02985,A,do you see that in my eye
p02986_A,02986,A,yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together and such being the case i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time pray is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath
p02987_A,02987,A,mr elliot are you acquainted with mr elliot
p02988_A,02988,A,i have been a good deal acquainted with him but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met
p02989_A,02989,A,i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you
p02990_A,02990,A,to confess the truth that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done
p02991_A,02991,A,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me
p02992_A,02992,A,i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune
p02993_A,02993,A,no nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am
p02994_A,02994,A,now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis
p02995_A,02995,A,my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one
p02996_A,02996,A,oh if these are your only objections mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin
p02997_A,02997,A,no i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that do tell me how it first came into your head
p02998_A,02998,A,it first came into my head upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago
p02999_A,02999,A,and has it indeed been spoken of
p03000_A,03000,A,did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday
p03001_A,03001,A,no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular
p03002_A,03002,A,it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
p03003_A,03003,A,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message
p03004_A,03004,A,no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with
p03005_A,03005,A,i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years
p03006_A,03006,A,i did
p03007_A,03007,A,not before he was married i suppose
p03008_A,03008,A,yes he was not married when i knew him first
p03009_A,03009,A,indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now
p03010_A,03010,A,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him
p03011_A,03011,A,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man
p03012_A,03012,A,i know it all i know it all he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put
p03013_A,03013,A,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back
p03014_A,03014,A,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other
p03015_A,03015,A,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot
p03016_A,03016,A,to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from
p03017_A,03017,A,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character
p03018_A,03018,A,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty
p03019_A,03019,A,but was not she a very low woman
p03020_A,03020,A,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof
p03021_A,03021,A,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now
p03022_A,03022,A,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger
p03023_A,03023,A,thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now
p03024_A,03024,A,i can explain this too
p03025_A,03025,A,can you really
p03026_A,03026,A,yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis
p03027_A,03027,A,colonel wallis you are acquainted with him
p03028_A,03028,A,no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed
p03029_A,03029,A,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived
p03030_A,03030,A,i know you did i know it all perfectly but
p03031_A,03031,A,indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left
p03032_A,03032,A,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you
p03033_A,03033,A,he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme
p03034_A,03034,A,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do
p03035_A,03035,A,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not
p03036_A,03036,A,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation
p03037_A,03037,A,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness
p03038_A,03038,A,i had not the smallest intention of asking him but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least
p03039_A,03039,A,indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty
p03040_A,03040,A,oh i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect
p03041_A,03041,A,quite delightful exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son
p03042_A,03042,A,oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men
p03043_A,03043,A,my dear miss elliot
p03044_A,03044,A,very well i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrang in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course
p03045_A,03045,A,and a very good living it was only five and twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought charles is too cool about sporting that s the worst of him
p03046_A,03046,A,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p03047_A,03047,A,oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now
p03048_A,03048,A,such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now
p03049_A,03049,A,yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long
p03050_A,03050,A,that cannot be much to your taste i know but i do believe him to be an excellent young man
p03051_A,03051,A,anne there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself
p03052_A,03052,A,do come anne come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme
p03053_A,03053,A,well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother
p03054_A,03054,A,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p03055_A,03055,A,phoo phoo what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play
p03056_A,03056,A,oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go
p03057_A,03057,A,no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise
p03058_A,03058,A,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p03059_A,03059,A,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p03060_A,03060,A,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p03061_A,03061,A,you have not been long enough in bath to enjoy the evening parties of the place
p03062_A,03062,A,oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player
p03063_A,03063,A,you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes
p03064_A,03064,A,i am not yet so much changed
p03065_A,03065,A,we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials
p03066_A,03066,A,and so ma am all these thing considered though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement
p03067_A,03067,A,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p03068_A,03068,A,oh dear mrs croft there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement
p03069_A,03069,A,look here do you know who that is
p03070_A,03070,A,certainly captain benwick
p03071_A,03071,A,yes and you may guess who it is for but it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it he is writing about it now poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon
p03072_A,03072,A,no that i can easily believe
p03073_A,03073,A,it was not in her nature she doted on him
p03074_A,03074,A,it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions
p03075_A,03075,A,granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since
p03076_A,03076,A,true very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick
p03077_A,03077,A,no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather
p03078_A,03078,A,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p03079_A,03079,A,have you finished your letter
p03080_A,03080,A,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p03081_A,03081,A,there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men
p03082_A,03082,A,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p03083_A,03083,A,but how shall we prove anything
p03084_A,03084,A,we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said
p03085_A,03085,A,ah if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts
p03086_A,03086,A,oh i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone
p03087_A,03087,A,here frederick you and i part company i believe i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves
p03088_A,03088,A,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p03089_A,03089,A,good morning god bless you
p03090_A,03090,A,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p03091_A,03091,A,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p03092_A,03092,A,oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going
p03093_A,03093,A,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p03094_A,03094,A,to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say
p03095_A,03095,A,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p03096_A,03096,A,i hardly know
p03097_A,03097,A,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
p03098_A,03098,A,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me
p03099_A,03099,A,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
p03100_A,03100,A,perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added
p03101_A,03101,A,i should have thought that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this
p03102_A,03102,A,no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here
p03103_A,03103,A,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion
p03104_A,03104,A,not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then
p03105_A,03105,A,would i
p03106_A,03106,A,my dear mr bennet have you heard that netherfield park is let at last but it is for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it do not you want to know who has taken it
p03107_A,03107,A,you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it
p03108_A,03108,A,why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week
p03109_A,03109,A,is he married or single
p03110_A,03110,A,oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls
p03111_A,03111,A,how so how can it affect them
p03112_A,03112,A,my dear mr bennet how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
p03113_A,03113,A,is that his design in settling here
p03114_A,03114,A,design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes
p03115_A,03115,A,i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party
p03116_A,03116,A,my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
p03117_A,03117,A,in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
p03118_A,03118,A,but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood
p03119_A,03119,A,it is more than i engage for i assure you
p03120_A,03120,A,but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not
p03121_A,03121,A,you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
p03122_A,03122,A,i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference
p03123_A,03123,A,they have none of them much to recommend them they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
p03124_A,03124,A,mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves
p03125_A,03125,A,you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least
p03126_A,03126,A,ah you do not know what i suffer
p03127_A,03127,A,but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
p03128_A,03128,A,it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
p03129_A,03129,A,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
p03130_A,03130,A,we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes since we are not to visit
p03131_A,03131,A,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p03132_A,03132,A,i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her
p03133_A,03133,A,no more have i and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
p03134_A,03134,A,don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
p03135_A,03135,A,kitty has no discretion in her coughs she times them ill
p03136_A,03136,A,i do not cough for my own amusement
p03137_A,03137,A,to morrow fortnight
p03138_A,03138,A,aye so it is and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself
p03139_A,03139,A,then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her
p03140_A,03140,A,impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing
p03141_A,03141,A,i honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself
p03142_A,03142,A,nonsense nonsense
p03143_A,03143,A,what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts while mary is adjusting her ideas let us return to mr bingley
p03144_A,03144,A,i am sick of mr bingley
p03145_A,03145,A,i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now
p03146_A,03146,A,how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now
p03147_A,03147,A,now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse
p03148_A,03148,A,what an excellent father you have girls i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball
p03149_A,03149,A,oh i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest
p03150_A,03150,A,come darcy i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance
p03151_A,03151,A,i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with
p03152_A,03152,A,i would not be so fastidious as you are for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty
p03153_A,03153,A,you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room
p03154_A,03154,A,oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you
p03155_A,03155,A,oh my dear mr bennet we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger
p03156_A,03156,A,if he had had any compassion for me he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance
p03157_A,03157,A,he is just what a young man ought to be sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding
p03158_A,03158,A,he is also handsome which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete
p03159_A,03159,A,i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment
p03160_A,03160,A,did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person
p03161_A,03161,A,dear lizzy
p03162_A,03162,A,oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life
p03163_A,03163,A,i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think
p03164_A,03164,A,i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his
p03165_A,03165,A,you began the evening well charlotte you were mr bingley s first choice
p03166_A,03166,A,yes but he seemed to like his second better
p03167_A,03167,A,oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson
p03168_A,03168,A,perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point
p03169_A,03169,A,upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know
p03170_A,03170,A,my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
p03171_A,03171,A,i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
p03172_A,03172,A,aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to
p03173_A,03173,A,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable
p03174_A,03174,A,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
p03175_A,03175,A,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p03176_A,03176,A,another time lizzy i would not dance with him if i were you
p03177_A,03177,A,i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him
p03178_A,03178,A,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p03179_A,03179,A,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine
p03180_A,03180,A,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p03181_A,03181,A,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p03182_A,03182,A,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p03183_A,03183,A,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
p03184_A,03184,A,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
p03185_A,03185,A,remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do
p03186_A,03186,A,but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out
p03187_A,03187,A,perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses
p03188_A,03188,A,your plan is a good one where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character
p03189_A,03189,A,not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal
p03190_A,03190,A,yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded
p03191_A,03191,A,well i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life
p03192_A,03192,A,you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself what does mr darcy mean by listening to my conversation with colonel forster
p03193_A,03193,A,that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
p03194_A,03194,A,did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton
p03195_A,03195,A,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic
p03196_A,03196,A,you are severe on us
p03197_A,03197,A,it will be her turn soon to be teazed i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
p03198_A,03198,A,what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies
p03199_A,03199,A,certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance
p03200_A,03200,A,your friend performs delightfully and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy
p03201_A,03201,A,you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir
p03202_A,03202,A,yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james s
p03203_A,03203,A,never sir
p03204_A,03204,A,do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place
p03205_A,03205,A,it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
p03206_A,03206,A,my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you
p03207_A,03207,A,indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner
p03208_A,03208,A,you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour
p03209_A,03209,A,mr darcy is all politeness
p03210_A,03210,A,i can guess the subject of your reverie
p03211_A,03211,A,i should imagine not
p03212_A,03212,A,you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them
p03213_A,03213,A,your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss elizabeth bennet
p03214_A,03214,A,miss elizabeth bennet i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy
p03215_A,03215,A,that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy
p03216_A,03216,A,from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced
p03217_A,03217,A,i am astonished my dear that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however
p03218_A,03218,A,if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it
p03219_A,03219,A,yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever
p03220_A,03220,A,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish
p03221_A,03221,A,my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals
p03222_A,03222,A,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p03223_A,03223,A,well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
p03224_A,03224,A,it is from miss bingley
p03225_A,03225,A,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p03226_A,03226,A,dining out that is very unlucky
p03227_A,03227,A,can i have the carriage
p03228_A,03228,A,no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night
p03229_A,03229,A,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p03230_A,03230,A,oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs
p03231_A,03231,A,i had much rather go in the coach
p03232_A,03232,A,but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they
p03233_A,03233,A,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p03234_A,03234,A,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p03235_A,03235,A,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders
p03236_A,03236,A,oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage how can you be so silly as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there
p03237_A,03237,A,i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
p03238_A,03238,A,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p03239_A,03239,A,no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
p03240_A,03240,A,i admire the activity of your benevolence but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
p03241_A,03241,A,she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild
p03242_A,03242,A,she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
p03243_A,03243,A,yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office
p03244_A,03244,A,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p03245_A,03245,A,you observed it mr darcy i am sure and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition
p03246_A,03246,A,certainly not
p03247_A,03247,A,to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum
p03248_A,03248,A,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p03249_A,03249,A,i am afraid mr darcy that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
p03250_A,03250,A,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p03251_A,03251,A,i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it
p03252_A,03252,A,i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
p03253_A,03253,A,yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
p03254_A,03254,A,that is capital
p03255_A,03255,A,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p03256_A,03256,A,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p03257_A,03257,A,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p03258_A,03258,A,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p03259_A,03259,A,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p03260_A,03260,A,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p03261_A,03261,A,i am astonished that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy
p03262_A,03262,A,it ought to be good it has been the work of many generations
p03263_A,03263,A,and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books
p03264_A,03264,A,i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
p03265_A,03265,A,neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley
p03266_A,03266,A,i wish it may
p03267_A,03267,A,but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire
p03268_A,03268,A,with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it
p03269_A,03269,A,i am talking of possibilities charles
p03270_A,03270,A,upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
p03271_A,03271,A,is miss darcy much grown since the spring will she be as tall as i am
p03272_A,03272,A,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p03273_A,03273,A,how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite
p03274_A,03274,A,it is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are
p03275_A,03275,A,all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
p03276_A,03276,A,yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished
p03277_A,03277,A,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p03278_A,03278,A,nor i i am sure
p03279_A,03279,A,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p03280_A,03280,A,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
p03281_A,03281,A,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p03282_A,03282,A,all this she must possess and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading
p03283_A,03283,A,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any
p03284_A,03284,A,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this
p03285_A,03285,A,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united
p03286_A,03286,A,eliza bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
p03287_A,03287,A,indeed i have sir she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
p03288_A,03288,A,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p03289_A,03289,A,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p03290_A,03290,A,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p03291_A,03291,A,whatever i do is done in a hurry and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
p03292_A,03292,A,that is exactly what i should have supposed of you
p03293_A,03293,A,you begin to comprehend me do you
p03294_A,03294,A,oh yes i understand you perfectly
p03295_A,03295,A,i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
p03296_A,03296,A,that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
p03297_A,03297,A,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p03298_A,03298,A,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p03299_A,03299,A,yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage
p03300_A,03300,A,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p03301_A,03301,A,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever
p03302_A,03302,A,yes indeed i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all
p03303_A,03303,A,indeed mama you are mistaken you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true
p03304_A,03304,A,certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter
p03305_A,03305,A,did charlotte dine with you
p03306_A,03306,A,no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend
p03307_A,03307,A,she seems a very pleasant young woman
p03308_A,03308,A,oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were
p03309_A,03309,A,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
p03310_A,03310,A,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p03311_A,03311,A,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
p03312_A,03312,A,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p03313_A,03313,A,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p03314_A,03314,A,how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter you write uncommonly fast
p03315_A,03315,A,you are mistaken i write rather slowly
p03316_A,03316,A,how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them
p03317_A,03317,A,it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours
p03318_A,03318,A,pray tell your sister that i long to see her
p03319_A,03319,A,i have already told her so once by your desire
p03320_A,03320,A,i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well
p03321_A,03321,A,thank you but i always mend my own
p03322_A,03322,A,how can you contrive to write so even tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s
p03323_A,03323,A,will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice
p03324_A,03324,A,oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy
p03325_A,03325,A,they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine
p03326_A,03326,A,it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill
p03327_A,03327,A,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p03328_A,03328,A,my style of writing is very different from yours
p03329_A,03329,A,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p03330_A,03330,A,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p03331_A,03331,A,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p03332_A,03332,A,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast
p03333_A,03333,A,and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
p03334_A,03334,A,the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else
p03335_A,03335,A,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
p03336_A,03336,A,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month
p03337_A,03337,A,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself
p03338_A,03338,A,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could
p03339_A,03339,A,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
p03340_A,03340,A,upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself
p03341_A,03341,A,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
p03342_A,03342,A,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you
p03343_A,03343,A,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either
p03344_A,03344,A,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
p03345_A,03345,A,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties
p03346_A,03346,A,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do
p03347_A,03347,A,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this
p03348_A,03348,A,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
p03349_A,03349,A,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter
p03350_A,03350,A,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel
p03351_A,03351,A,oh i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare
p03352_A,03352,A,i hope you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses
p03353_A,03353,A,have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity
p03354_A,03354,A,it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied
p03355_A,03355,A,i did not know that you intended to walk
p03356_A,03356,A,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out
p03357_A,03357,A,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue
p03358_A,03358,A,very glad
p03359_A,03359,A,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure
p03360_A,03360,A,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
p03361_A,03361,A,i should like balls infinitely better if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day
p03362_A,03362,A,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball
p03363_A,03363,A,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude
p03364_A,03364,A,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
p03365_A,03365,A,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
p03366_A,03366,A,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done
p03367_A,03367,A,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself
p03368_A,03368,A,mr darcy is not to be laughed at that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh
p03369_A,03369,A,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
p03370_A,03370,A,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without
p03371_A,03371,A,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule
p03372_A,03372,A,such as vanity and pride
p03373_A,03373,A,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
p03374_A,03374,A,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p03375_A,03375,A,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise
p03376_A,03376,A,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
p03377_A,03377,A,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me
p03378_A,03378,A,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome
p03379_A,03379,A,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body
p03380_A,03380,A,and yours is wilfully to misunderstand them
p03381_A,03381,A,i hope my dear that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
p03382_A,03382,A,who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home
p03383_A,03383,A,the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger
p03384_A,03384,A,a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment
p03385_A,03385,A,it is not mr bingley it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases
p03386_A,03386,A,oh my dear i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it
p03387_A,03387,A,it certainly is a most iniquitous affair and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself
p03388_A,03388,A,no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him
p03389_A,03389,A,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
p03390_A,03390,A,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him
p03391_A,03391,A,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p03392_A,03392,A,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p03393_A,03393,A,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p03394_A,03394,A,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed
p03395_A,03395,A,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly
p03396_A,03396,A,you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
p03397_A,03397,A,ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed
p03398_A,03398,A,i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted
p03399_A,03399,A,that is all very proper and civil i am sure and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir
p03400_A,03400,A,the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence
p03401_A,03401,A,i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family
p03402_A,03402,A,she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property
p03403_A,03403,A,ah then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome
p03404_A,03404,A,she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
p03405_A,03405,A,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
p03406_A,03406,A,her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay
p03407_A,03407,A,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p03408_A,03408,A,they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible
p03409_A,03409,A,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p03410_A,03410,A,i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin
p03411_A,03411,A,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
p03412_A,03412,A,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life
p03413_A,03413,A,about a month he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand
p03414_A,03414,A,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
p03415_A,03415,A,as much as i ever wish to be i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable
p03416_A,03416,A,i have no right to give my opinion as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family
p03417_A,03417,A,upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one
p03418_A,03418,A,i cannot pretend to be sorry that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
p03419_A,03419,A,i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man
p03420_A,03420,A,i wonder whether he is likely to be in this country much longer
p03421_A,03421,A,i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood
p03422_A,03422,A,yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere
p03423_A,03423,A,good heavens but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress
p03424_A,03424,A,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me
p03425_A,03425,A,this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced
p03426_A,03426,A,some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him
p03427_A,03427,A,but what can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly
p03428_A,03428,A,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me
p03429_A,03429,A,i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful
p03430_A,03430,A,i will not trust myself on the subject i can hardly be just to him
p03431_A,03431,A,to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner
p03432_A,03432,A,we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself
p03433_A,03433,A,how strange how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it
p03434_A,03434,A,it is wonderful for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride
p03435_A,03435,A,can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good
p03436_A,03436,A,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers
p03437_A,03437,A,what sort of a girl is miss darcy
p03438_A,03438,A,i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education
p03439_A,03439,A,i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley
p03440_A,03440,A,not at all
p03441_A,03441,A,he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is
p03442_A,03442,A,i know very well madam that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters
p03443_A,03443,A,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long
p03444_A,03444,A,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
p03445_A,03445,A,no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday
p03446_A,03446,A,her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
p03447_A,03447,A,mr collins speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman
p03448_A,03448,A,they have both been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side
p03449_A,03449,A,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
p03450_A,03450,A,laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no
p03451_A,03451,A,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks
p03452_A,03452,A,it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think
p03453_A,03453,A,i dare say you will find him very agreeable
p03454_A,03454,A,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent
p03455_A,03455,A,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing
p03456_A,03456,A,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible
p03457_A,03457,A,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine
p03458_A,03458,A,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb
p03459_A,03459,A,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly
p03460_A,03460,A,i must not decide on my own performance when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance
p03461_A,03461,A,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain
p03462_A,03462,A,i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
p03463_A,03463,A,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
p03464_A,03464,A,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
p03465_A,03465,A,what think you of books
p03466_A,03466,A,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings
p03467_A,03467,A,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions
p03468_A,03468,A,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else
p03469_A,03469,A,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it
p03470_A,03470,A,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created
p03471_A,03471,A,i am
p03472_A,03472,A,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice
p03473_A,03473,A,i hope not
p03474_A,03474,A,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first
p03475_A,03475,A,may i ask to what these questions tend
p03476_A,03476,A,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out
p03477_A,03477,A,and what is your success
p03478_A,03478,A,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
p03479_A,03479,A,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
p03480_A,03480,A,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity
p03481_A,03481,A,so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcy s steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better
p03482_A,03482,A,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself
p03483_A,03483,A,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant
p03484_A,03484,A,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon
p03485_A,03485,A,no i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard
p03486_A,03486,A,mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself
p03487_A,03487,A,no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
p03488_A,03488,A,this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living
p03489_A,03489,A,he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only
p03490_A,03490,A,i have found out by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology
p03491_A,03491,A,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
p03492_A,03492,A,what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear
p03493_A,03493,A,that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit
p03494_A,03494,A,lord how tired i am
p03495_A,03495,A,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning
p03496_A,03496,A,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs
p03497_A,03497,A,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p03498_A,03498,A,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins
p03499_A,03499,A,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
p03500_A,03500,A,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them
p03501_A,03501,A,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
p03502_A,03502,A,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation
p03503_A,03503,A,were it certain that lady catherine would think so but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications
p03504_A,03504,A,indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled
p03505_A,03505,A,when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character
p03506_A,03506,A,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one
p03507_A,03507,A,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females
p03508_A,03508,A,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart
p03509_A,03509,A,but depend upon it mr collins that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it
p03510_A,03510,A,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
p03511_A,03511,A,oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her
p03512_A,03512,A,i have not the pleasure of understanding you of what are you talking
p03513_A,03513,A,of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy
p03514_A,03514,A,and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business
p03515_A,03515,A,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him
p03516_A,03516,A,come here child i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true very well and this offer of marriage you have refused
p03517_A,03517,A,i have sir
p03518_A,03518,A,very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet
p03519_A,03519,A,yes or i will never see her again
p03520_A,03520,A,an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do
p03521_A,03521,A,what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him
p03522_A,03522,A,oh mr collins
p03523_A,03523,A,this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says
p03524_A,03524,A,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
p03525_A,03525,A,caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you it is evident by this that he comes back no more this winter
p03526_A,03526,A,it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should
p03527_A,03527,A,why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject
p03528_A,03528,A,yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it
p03529_A,03529,A,most willingly
p03530_A,03530,A,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend
p03531_A,03531,A,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself
p03532_A,03532,A,that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer
p03533_A,03533,A,but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere
p03534_A,03534,A,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him
p03535_A,03535,A,how can you talk so you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate
p03536_A,03536,A,i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion
p03537_A,03537,A,but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months
p03538_A,03538,A,my dear madam this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible
p03539_A,03539,A,but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness
p03540_A,03540,A,my dear sir i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence
p03541_A,03541,A,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
p03542_A,03542,A,believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth
p03543_A,03543,A,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
p03544_A,03544,A,good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy
p03545_A,03545,A,indeed mr bennet it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it
p03546_A,03546,A,my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor
p03547_A,03547,A,i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it
p03548_A,03548,A,what should not you mind
p03549_A,03549,A,i should not mind any thing at all
p03550_A,03550,A,let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility
p03551_A,03551,A,i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else
p03552_A,03552,A,oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before you doubt me indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself
p03553_A,03553,A,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable
p03554_A,03554,A,my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin
p03555_A,03555,A,to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness
p03556_A,03556,A,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does
p03557_A,03557,A,and men take care that they should
p03558_A,03558,A,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine
p03559_A,03559,A,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business
p03560_A,03560,A,and do you impute it to either of those
p03561_A,03561,A,yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can
p03562_A,03562,A,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him
p03563_A,03563,A,yes in conjunction with his friend
p03564_A,03564,A,i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it
p03565_A,03565,A,your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride
p03566_A,03566,A,so lizzy your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably
p03567_A,03567,A,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune
p03568_A,03568,A,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves
p03569_A,03569,A,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
p03570_A,03570,A,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before
p03571_A,03571,A,but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love
p03572_A,03572,A,i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love
p03573_A,03573,A,oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything i hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her
p03574_A,03574,A,and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him
p03575_A,03575,A,so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling
p03576_A,03576,A,she will drop the acquaintance entirely
p03577_A,03577,A,you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father
p03578_A,03578,A,my dear aunt this is being serious indeed
p03579_A,03579,A,yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
p03580_A,03580,A,well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it
p03581_A,03581,A,elizabeth you are not serious now
p03582_A,03582,A,i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best
p03583_A,03583,A,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him
p03584_A,03584,A,i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza
p03585_A,03585,A,that you certainly shall
p03586_A,03586,A,and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me
p03587_A,03587,A,we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire
p03588_A,03588,A,but my dear elizabeth what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary
p03589_A,03589,A,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary
p03590_A,03590,A,if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think
p03591_A,03591,A,she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her
p03592_A,03592,A,but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune
p03593_A,03593,A,no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor
p03594_A,03594,A,but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event
p03595_A,03595,A,a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we
p03596_A,03596,A,her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling
p03597_A,03597,A,well have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish
p03598_A,03598,A,no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
p03599_A,03599,A,oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all
p03600_A,03600,A,take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us but perhaps to the lakes
p03601_A,03601,A,yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several
p03602_A,03602,A,lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed and a most attentive neighbour
p03603_A,03603,A,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
p03604_A,03604,A,oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment
p03605_A,03605,A,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter
p03606_A,03606,A,la my dear it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small
p03607_A,03607,A,she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in
p03608_A,03608,A,oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in
p03609_A,03609,A,i confess that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival
p03610_A,03610,A,i am the less surprised at what has happened from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon
p03611_A,03611,A,your father s estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family do you play and sing miss bennet
p03612_A,03612,A,a little
p03613_A,03613,A,oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing
p03614_A,03614,A,one of them does
p03615_A,03615,A,why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s do you draw
p03616_A,03616,A,no not at all
p03617_A,03617,A,what none of you
p03618_A,03618,A,not one
p03619_A,03619,A,that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters
p03620_A,03620,A,my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london
p03621_A,03621,A,has your governess left you
p03622_A,03622,A,we never had any governess
p03623_A,03623,A,no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected
p03624_A,03624,A,compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might
p03625_A,03625,A,aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure said she are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet
p03626_A,03626,A,yes ma am all
p03627_A,03627,A,all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young
p03628_A,03628,A,yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind
p03629_A,03629,A,upon my word you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age
p03630_A,03630,A,with three younger sisters grown up your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it
p03631_A,03631,A,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age
p03632_A,03632,A,i am not one and twenty
p03633_A,03633,A,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
p03634_A,03634,A,what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is
p03635_A,03635,A,we are speaking of music madam
p03636_A,03636,A,of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy i am very glad to hear such a good account of her and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal
p03637_A,03637,A,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p03638_A,03638,A,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house
p03639_A,03639,A,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
p03640_A,03640,A,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
p03641_A,03641,A,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
p03642_A,03642,A,i am not afraid of you
p03643_A,03643,A,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p03644_A,03644,A,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact
p03645_A,03645,A,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
p03646_A,03646,A,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders
p03647_A,03647,A,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
p03648_A,03648,A,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers
p03649_A,03649,A,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p03650_A,03650,A,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done
p03651_A,03651,A,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution
p03652_A,03652,A,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn
p03653_A,03653,A,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
p03654_A,03654,A,perfectly so i thank you
p03655_A,03655,A,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again
p03656_A,03656,A,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing
p03657_A,03657,A,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle
p03658_A,03658,A,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford
p03659_A,03659,A,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object
p03660_A,03660,A,mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife
p03661_A,03661,A,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her
p03662_A,03662,A,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends
p03663_A,03663,A,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles
p03664_A,03664,A,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance
p03665_A,03665,A,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family
p03666_A,03666,A,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far
p03667_A,03667,A,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance
p03668_A,03668,A,what can be the meaning of this my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way
p03669_A,03669,A,i did not know before that you ever walked this way
p03670_A,03670,A,i have been making the tour of the park as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther
p03671_A,03671,A,no i should have turned in a moment do you certainly leave kent on saturday
p03672_A,03672,A,yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases
p03673_A,03673,A,and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy
p03674_A,03674,A,he likes to have his own way very well but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence
p03675_A,03675,A,in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for
p03676_A,03676,A,these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like
p03677_A,03677,A,unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do
p03678_A,03678,A,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
p03679_A,03679,A,and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her
p03680_A,03680,A,no that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
p03681_A,03681,A,are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them
p03682_A,03682,A,i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s
p03683_A,03683,A,oh yes mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
p03684_A,03684,A,care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture
p03685_A,03685,A,what is it you mean
p03686_A,03686,A,it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing
p03687_A,03687,A,you may depend upon my not mentioning it
p03688_A,03688,A,and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
p03689_A,03689,A,did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference
p03690_A,03690,A,i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady
p03691_A,03691,A,and what arts did he use to separate them
p03692_A,03692,A,he did not talk to me of his own arts he only told me what i have now told you
p03693_A,03693,A,i am thinking of what you have been telling me your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge
p03694_A,03694,A,you are rather disposed to call his interference officious
p03695_A,03695,A,i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case
p03696_A,03696,A,that is not an unnatural surmise but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly there were some very strong objections against the lady
p03697_A,03697,A,in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you
p03698_A,03698,A,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation
p03699_A,03699,A,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance
p03700_A,03700,A,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it
p03701_A,03701,A,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself
p03702_A,03702,A,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others
p03703_A,03703,A,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns
p03704_A,03704,A,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him
p03705_A,03705,A,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed
p03706_A,03706,A,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule
p03707_A,03707,A,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own
p03708_A,03708,A,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
p03709_A,03709,A,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter
p03710_A,03710,A,i assure you i feel it exceedingly i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure
p03711_A,03711,A,i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday
p03712_A,03712,A,why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight
p03713_A,03713,A,but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return
p03714_A,03714,A,oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large
p03715_A,03715,A,you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan
p03716_A,03716,A,mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone
p03717_A,03717,A,my uncle is to send a servant for us
p03718_A,03718,A,oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to
p03719_A,03719,A,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
p03720_A,03720,A,good gracious it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened
p03721_A,03721,A,a great many indeed
p03722_A,03722,A,we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell
p03723_A,03723,A,and we mean to treat you all but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight
p03724_A,03724,A,are they indeed
p03725_A,03725,A,they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have
p03726_A,03726,A,now i have got some news for you what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe
p03727_A,03727,A,and mary king is safe safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune
p03728_A,03728,A,she is a great fool for going away if she liked him
p03729_A,03729,A,but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side
p03730_A,03730,A,i am glad you are come back lizzy
p03731_A,03731,A,oh mary i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off
p03732_A,03732,A,his being so sure of succeeding was wrong and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment
p03733_A,03733,A,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him
p03734_A,03734,A,blame you oh no
p03735_A,03735,A,but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
p03736_A,03736,A,no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did
p03737_A,03737,A,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse
p03738_A,03738,A,i do not know when i have been more shocked wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so
p03739_A,03739,A,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather
p03740_A,03740,A,poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner
p03741_A,03741,A,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it
p03742_A,03742,A,i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do
p03743_A,03743,A,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
p03744_A,03744,A,lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now
p03745_A,03745,A,indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you
p03746_A,03746,A,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved
p03747_A,03747,A,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character
p03748_A,03748,A,surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion
p03749_A,03749,A,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it
p03750_A,03750,A,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate
p03751_A,03751,A,well lizzy what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know
p03752_A,03752,A,i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more
p03753_A,03753,A,oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done well lizzy and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say
p03754_A,03754,A,no nothing at all
p03755_A,03755,A,a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens
p03756_A,03756,A,it was a subject which they could not mention before me
p03757_A,03757,A,i am sure i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart
p03758_A,03758,A,i am sure i shall break mine
p03759_A,03759,A,if one could but go to brighton
p03760_A,03760,A,oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable
p03761_A,03761,A,lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances
p03762_A,03762,A,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
p03763_A,03763,A,already arisen what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly
p03764_A,03764,A,indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace
p03765_A,03765,A,how long did you say that he was at rosings
p03766_A,03766,A,nearly three weeks
p03767_A,03767,A,and you saw him frequently
p03768_A,03768,A,yes almost every day
p03769_A,03769,A,his manners are very different from his cousin s
p03770_A,03770,A,yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance
p03771_A,03771,A,indeed and pray may i ask is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope that he is improved in essentials
p03772_A,03772,A,oh no in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood
p03773_A,03773,A,you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart
p03774_A,03774,A,my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know if it were merely a fine house richly furnished i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country
p03775_A,03775,A,but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends he is now gone into the army but i am afraid he has turned out very wild and that is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago
p03776_A,03776,A,i have heard much of your master s fine person it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not
p03777_A,03777,A,does that young lady know mr darcy
p03778_A,03778,A,a little
p03779_A,03779,A,and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am
p03780_A,03780,A,yes very handsome
p03781_A,03781,A,i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them
p03782_A,03782,A,and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother
p03783_A,03783,A,oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him
p03784_A,03784,A,is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
p03785_A,03785,A,not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
p03786_A,03786,A,if your master would marry you might see more of him
p03787_A,03787,A,yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him
p03788_A,03788,A,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p03789_A,03789,A,i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old
p03790_A,03790,A,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p03791_A,03791,A,yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world
p03792_A,03792,A,his father was an excellent man
p03793_A,03793,A,yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor he is the best landlord and the best master that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
p03794_A,03794,A,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
p03795_A,03795,A,perhaps we might be deceived
p03796_A,03796,A,that is not very likely our authority was too good
p03797_A,03797,A,he is certainly a good brother
p03798_A,03798,A,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her
p03799_A,03799,A,for your housekeeper informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country
p03800_A,03800,A,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton
p03801_A,03801,A,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming
p03802_A,03802,A,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it
p03803_A,03803,A,i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
p03804_A,03804,A,to be sure lizzy he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable
p03805_A,03805,A,but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds
p03806_A,03806,A,how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again for my own part i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time
p03807_A,03807,A,i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose
p03808_A,03808,A,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill
p03809_A,03809,A,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now
p03810_A,03810,A,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain
p03811_A,03811,A,oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland
p03812_A,03812,A,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her
p03813_A,03813,A,my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake
p03814_A,03814,A,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day
p03815_A,03815,A,but what is to be done about pemberley john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so
p03816_A,03816,A,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled
p03817_A,03817,A,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk
p03818_A,03818,A,do you really think so
p03819_A,03819,A,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p03820_A,03820,A,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case
p03821_A,03821,A,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland
p03822_A,03822,A,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road
p03823_A,03823,A,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland
p03824_A,03824,A,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter
p03825_A,03825,A,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage
p03826_A,03826,A,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman
p03827_A,03827,A,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
p03828_A,03828,A,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating
p03829_A,03829,A,and do you really know all this
p03830_A,03830,A,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her
p03831_A,03831,A,but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand
p03832_A,03832,A,oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts
p03833_A,03833,A,when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other
p03834_A,03834,A,not yet but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well
p03835_A,03835,A,is my father in town
p03836_A,03836,A,yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word
p03837_A,03837,A,and have you heard from him often
p03838_A,03838,A,we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention
p03839_A,03839,A,and my mother how is she how are you all
p03840_A,03840,A,my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well
p03841_A,03841,A,if i had been able to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do
p03842_A,03842,A,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done
p03843_A,03843,A,this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex
p03844_A,03844,A,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever
p03845_A,03845,A,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey
p03846_A,03846,A,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself
p03847_A,03847,A,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before
p03848_A,03848,A,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married
p03849_A,03849,A,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks
p03850_A,03850,A,but not before they went to brighton
p03851_A,03851,A,no i believe not
p03852_A,03852,A,and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character
p03853_A,03853,A,i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false
p03854_A,03854,A,oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened
p03855_A,03855,A,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions
p03856_A,03856,A,could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife
p03857_A,03857,A,he brought it with him for us to see
p03858_A,03858,A,oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it
p03859_A,03859,A,i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion
p03860_A,03860,A,oh jane was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day
p03861_A,03861,A,i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties
p03862_A,03862,A,your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone
p03863_A,03863,A,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us
p03864_A,03864,A,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
p03865_A,03865,A,say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it
p03866_A,03866,A,you must not be too severe upon yourself
p03867_A,03867,A,you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough
p03868_A,03868,A,do you suppose them to be in london
p03869_A,03869,A,yes where else can they be so well concealed
p03870_A,03870,A,and lydia used to want to go to london
p03871_A,03871,A,this is a parade which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away
p03872_A,03872,A,i am not going to run away papa if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
p03873_A,03873,A,i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask
p03874_A,03874,A,what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
p03875_A,03875,A,if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse
p03876_A,03876,A,oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
p03877_A,03877,A,yes i have had a letter from him by express
p03878_A,03878,A,well and what news does it bring good or bad
p03879_A,03879,A,what is there of good to be expected but perhaps you would like to read it read it aloud for i hardly know myself what it is about
p03880_A,03880,A,then it is as i always hoped they are married
p03881_A,03881,A,is it possible can it be possible that he will marry her
p03882_A,03882,A,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you
p03883_A,03883,A,and have you answered the letter
p03884_A,03884,A,no but it must be done soon
p03885_A,03885,A,oh my dear father come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case
p03886_A,03886,A,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p03887_A,03887,A,i dislike it very much but it must be done
p03888_A,03888,A,and may i ask but the terms i suppose must be complied with
p03889_A,03889,A,complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little
p03890_A,03890,A,and they must marry yet he is such a man
p03891_A,03891,A,yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him
p03892_A,03892,A,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p03893_A,03893,A,i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone
p03894_A,03894,A,that is very true though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
p03895_A,03895,A,no wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
p03896_A,03896,A,and they are really to be married how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia
p03897_A,03897,A,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds
p03898_A,03898,A,if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt
p03899_A,03899,A,we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten
p03900_A,03900,A,just as you please
p03901_A,03901,A,may we take my uncle s letter to read to her
p03902_A,03902,A,my dear dear lydia this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet
p03903_A,03903,A,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p03904_A,03904,A,haye park might do if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful
p03905_A,03905,A,mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn
p03906_A,03906,A,only think of its being three months since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman well mamma and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go
p03907_A,03907,A,very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i don t at all like your going such a way off must it be so
p03908_A,03908,A,oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all
p03909_A,03909,A,i should like it beyond any thing
p03910_A,03910,A,and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over
p03911_A,03911,A,i thank you for my share of the favour but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
p03912_A,03912,A,lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed
p03913_A,03913,A,no really i think there cannot be too little said on the subject
p03914_A,03914,A,la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well
p03915_A,03915,A,mr darcy
p03916_A,03916,A,oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
p03917_A,03917,A,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p03918_A,03918,A,oh certainly we will ask you no questions
p03919_A,03919,A,thank you for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry
p03920_A,03920,A,i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister
p03921_A,03921,A,you certainly do but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome
p03922_A,03922,A,i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better
p03923_A,03923,A,true are the others coming out
p03924_A,03924,A,i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you
p03925_A,03925,A,yes she did
p03926_A,03926,A,and what did she say
p03927_A,03927,A,that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented
p03928_A,03928,A,certainly i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there
p03929_A,03929,A,perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year
p03930_A,03930,A,undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had
p03931_A,03931,A,yes he introduced us to his sister
p03932_A,03932,A,and do you like her
p03933_A,03933,A,very much
p03934_A,03934,A,i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well
p03935_A,03935,A,i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age
p03936_A,03936,A,did you go by the village of kympton
p03937_A,03937,A,i do not recollect that we did
p03938_A,03938,A,i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect
p03939_A,03939,A,how should you have liked making sermons
p03940_A,03940,A,exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent
p03941_A,03941,A,i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron
p03942_A,03942,A,you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember
p03943_A,03943,A,i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly
p03944_A,03944,A,you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it
p03945_A,03945,A,oh my dear lydia when shall we meet again
p03946_A,03946,A,oh lord i don t know not these two or three years perhaps
p03947_A,03947,A,write to me very often my dear
p03948_A,03948,A,as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do
p03949_A,03949,A,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p03950_A,03950,A,i often think that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them
p03951_A,03951,A,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p03952_A,03952,A,well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
p03953_A,03953,A,i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but don t imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks
p03954_A,03954,A,as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear you will wait on him of course
p03955_A,03955,A,no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again tis an etiquette i despise if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again
p03956_A,03956,A,i begin to be sorry that he comes at all it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over
p03957_A,03957,A,there is a gentleman with him mamma who can it be
p03958_A,03958,A,some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know
p03959_A,03959,A,la it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr what s his name that tall proud man
p03960_A,03960,A,good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him
p03961_A,03961,A,it is a long time mr bingley since you went away i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennet s manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you
p03962_A,03962,A,you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement
p03963_A,03963,A,now that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance
p03964_A,03964,A,yes very indifferent indeed oh jane take care
p03965_A,03965,A,my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
p03966_A,03966,A,is your sister at pemberley still
p03967_A,03967,A,yes she will remain there till christmas
p03968_A,03968,A,and quite alone have all her friends left her
p03969_A,03969,A,well girls what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously
p03970_A,03970,A,it has been a very agreeable day the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man
p03971_A,03971,A,you are very cruel you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment
p03972_A,03972,A,how hard it is in some cases to be believed
p03973_A,03973,A,and how impossible in others
p03974_A,03974,A,but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge
p03975_A,03975,A,my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzy s hair
p03976_A,03976,A,we will be down as soon as we can but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago
p03977_A,03977,A,what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do
p03978_A,03978,A,tis too much by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy i must go instantly to my mother i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness
p03979_A,03979,A,where is your sister
p03980_A,03980,A,i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me
p03981_A,03981,A,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p03982_A,03982,A,he has made me so happy by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible
p03983_A,03983,A,i suspected as much but how did he account for it
p03984_A,03984,A,it must have been his sister s doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other
p03985_A,03985,A,that is the most unforgiving speech that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard
p03986_A,03986,A,would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again
p03987_A,03987,A,he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty
p03988_A,03988,A,i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you
p03989_A,03989,A,i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother and that i suppose is one of your sisters
p03990_A,03990,A,yes madam she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family
p03991_A,03991,A,you have a very small park here
p03992_A,03992,A,it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s
p03993_A,03993,A,this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west
p03994_A,03994,A,may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well
p03995_A,03995,A,yes very well i saw them the night before last miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company
p03996_A,03996,A,go my dear and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
p03997_A,03997,A,you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come
p03998_A,03998,A,indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here
p03999_A,03999,A,miss bennet you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you
p04000_A,04000,A,if you believed it impossible to be true i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it
p04001_A,04001,A,at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted
p04002_A,04002,A,your coming to longbourn to see me and my family will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence
p04003_A,04003,A,if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad
p04004_A,04004,A,i never heard that it was
p04005_A,04005,A,and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it
p04006_A,04006,A,i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer
p04007_A,04007,A,this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage
p04008_A,04008,A,your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
p04009_A,04009,A,it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in
p04010_A,04010,A,if i have i shall be the last person to confess it
p04011_A,04011,A,miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns
p04012_A,04012,A,but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit
p04013_A,04013,A,let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say
p04014_A,04014,A,only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me
p04015_A,04015,A,the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her s while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin
p04016_A,04016,A,yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him
p04017_A,04017,A,because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us
p04018_A,04018,A,these are heavy misfortunes but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine
p04019_A,04019,A,obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any person s whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment
p04020_A,04020,A,that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me
p04021_A,04021,A,i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up
p04022_A,04022,A,in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal
p04023_A,04023,A,true you are a gentleman s daughter but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition
p04024_A,04024,A,whatever my connections may be if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you
p04025_A,04025,A,tell me once for all are you engaged to him
p04026_A,04026,A,i am not
p04027_A,04027,A,and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement
p04028_A,04028,A,i will make no promise of the kind
p04029_A,04029,A,miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require
p04030_A,04030,A,and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject
p04031_A,04031,A,not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted
p04032_A,04032,A,you can now have nothing farther to say you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house
p04033_A,04033,A,you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody
p04034_A,04034,A,lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments
p04035_A,04035,A,you are then resolved to have him
p04036_A,04036,A,i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
p04037_A,04037,A,it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world
p04038_A,04038,A,neither duty nor honour nor gratitude have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn
p04039_A,04039,A,and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased
p04040_A,04040,A,she did not choose it she would go
p04041_A,04041,A,she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy
p04042_A,04042,A,lizzy i was going to look for you come into my room i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins
p04043_A,04043,A,from mr collins and what can he have to say
p04044_A,04044,A,something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable are you not diverted
p04045_A,04045,A,oh yes pray read on
p04046_A,04046,A,mr collins moreover adds that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn
p04047_A,04047,A,oh i am excessively diverted but it is so strange
p04048_A,04048,A,yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent
p04049_A,04049,A,mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express
p04050_A,04050,A,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted
p04051_A,04051,A,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them
p04052_A,04052,A,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly
p04053_A,04053,A,yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations
p04054_A,04054,A,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence
p04055_A,04055,A,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility
p04056_A,04056,A,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice
p04057_A,04057,A,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way
p04058_A,04058,A,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me
p04059_A,04059,A,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
p04060_A,04060,A,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me
p04061_A,04061,A,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies
p04062_A,04062,A,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
p04063_A,04063,A,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure
p04064_A,04064,A,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased
p04065_A,04065,A,had you then persuaded yourself that i should
p04066_A,04066,A,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses
p04067_A,04067,A,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening
p04068_A,04068,A,hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction
p04069_A,04069,A,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming
p04070_A,04070,A,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise
p04071_A,04071,A,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due
p04072_A,04072,A,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you
p04073_A,04073,A,i must ask whether you were surprised
p04074_A,04074,A,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen
p04075_A,04075,A,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much
p04076_A,04076,A,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together
p04077_A,04077,A,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring
p04078_A,04078,A,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection
p04079_A,04079,A,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him
p04080_A,04080,A,my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible
p04081_A,04081,A,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged
p04082_A,04082,A,oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him
p04083_A,04083,A,you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself
p04084_A,04084,A,good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him
p04085_A,04085,A,there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother
p04086_A,04086,A,very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do
p04087_A,04087,A,oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all
p04088_A,04088,A,what do you mean
p04089_A,04089,A,why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry
p04090_A,04090,A,my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him
p04091_A,04091,A,it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley
p04092_A,04092,A,mr bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day
p04093_A,04093,A,i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view
p04094_A,04094,A,it may do very well for the others but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty
p04095_A,04095,A,lizzy what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy
p04096_A,04096,A,have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference
p04097_A,04097,A,none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him
p04098_A,04098,A,i do i do like him i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms
p04099_A,04099,A,i admire all my three sons in law highly wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s
p04100_A,04100,A,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place
p04101_A,04101,A,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun
p04102_A,04102,A,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence
p04103_A,04103,A,for the liveliness of your mind i did
p04104_A,04104,A,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love
p04105_A,04105,A,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield
p04106_A,04106,A,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me
p04107_A,04107,A,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement
p04108_A,04108,A,but i was embarrassed
p04109_A,04109,A,and so was i
p04110_A,04110,A,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner
p04111_A,04111,A,a man who had felt less might
p04112_A,04112,A,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do
p04113_A,04113,A,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing
p04114_A,04114,A,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence
p04115_A,04115,A,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made
p04116_A,04116,A,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her
p04117_A,04117,A,i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly
p04118_A,04118,A,it was my father s last request to me that i should assist his widow and daughters
p04119_A,04119,A,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child
p04120_A,04120,A,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home
p04121_A,04121,A,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy
p04122_A,04122,A,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition
p04123_A,04123,A,to be sure it would
p04124_A,04124,A,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes
p04125_A,04125,A,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit
p04126_A,04126,A,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more
p04127_A,04127,A,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do
p04128_A,04128,A,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman
p04129_A,04129,A,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds
p04130_A,04130,A,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable
p04131_A,04131,A,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in
p04132_A,04132,A,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase
p04133_A,04133,A,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world
p04134_A,04134,A,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence
p04135_A,04135,A,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses
p04136_A,04136,A,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father
p04137_A,04137,A,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something
p04138_A,04138,A,upon my word i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then
p04139_A,04139,A,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it
p04140_A,04140,A,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here
p04141_A,04141,A,it is enough to say that he is unlike fanny is enough it implies everything amiable i love him already
p04142_A,04142,A,i think you will like him when you know more of him
p04143_A,04143,A,like him i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love
p04144_A,04144,A,you may esteem him
p04145_A,04145,A,in a few months my dear marianne elinor will in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she will be happy
p04146_A,04146,A,oh mama how shall we do without her
p04147_A,04147,A,my love it will be scarcely a separation we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion in the world of edward s heart but you look grave marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice
p04148_A,04148,A,perhaps i may consider it with some surprise edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly but yet he is not the kind of young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference
p04149_A,04149,A,he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would give him cowper
p04150_A,04150,A,nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference of taste elinor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him but it would have broke my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much he must have all edward s virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm
p04151_A,04151,A,remember my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness why should you be less fortunate than your mother in one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be different from hers
p04152_A,04152,A,what a pity it is elinor that edward should have no taste for drawing
p04153_A,04153,A,no taste for drawing why should you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right i hope marianne you do not consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him
p04154_A,04154,A,do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable
p04155_A,04155,A,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne
p04156_A,04156,A,i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart
p04157_A,04157,A,i do not attempt to deny that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him
p04158_A,04158,A,esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment
p04159_A,04159,A,excuse me and be assured that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings believe them to be stronger than i have declared believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicion the hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly but farther than this you must not believe i am by no means assured of his regard for me there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is in my heart i feel little scarcely any doubt of his preference but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank
p04160_A,04160,A,devonshire are you indeed going there so far from hence and to what part of it
p04161_A,04161,A,as for the house itself to be sure it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly
p04162_A,04162,A,but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him
p04163_A,04163,A,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p04164_A,04164,A,did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life
p04165_A,04165,A,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p04166_A,04166,A,mama you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony
p04167_A,04167,A,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her
p04168_A,04168,A,a woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other
p04169_A,04169,A,it would be impossible i know to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders
p04170_A,04170,A,but he talked of flannel waistcoats and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble
p04171_A,04171,A,had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever
p04172_A,04172,A,mama i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure edward ferrars is not well we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay what else can detain him at norland
p04173_A,04173,A,had you any idea of his coming so soon i had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor expect him already
p04174_A,04174,A,i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must
p04175_A,04175,A,i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time
p04176_A,04176,A,willoughby what is he in the country that is good news however i will ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday
p04177_A,04177,A,you know him then
p04178_A,04178,A,know him to be sure i do why he is down here every year
p04179_A,04179,A,and what sort of a young man is he
p04180_A,04180,A,as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england
p04181_A,04181,A,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p04182_A,04182,A,upon my soul i do not know much about him as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw was she out with him today
p04183_A,04183,A,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p04184_A,04184,A,yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides and if i were you i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself brandon will be jealous if she does not take care
p04185_A,04185,A,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p04186_A,04186,A,he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight o clock till four without once sitting down
p04187_A,04187,A,did he indeed and with elegance with spirit
p04188_A,04188,A,yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert
p04189_A,04189,A,that is what i like that is what a young man ought to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue
p04190_A,04190,A,aye aye i see how it will be i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor brandon
p04191_A,04191,A,that is an expression sir john which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one s cap at a man or making a conquest are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity
p04192_A,04192,A,ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles
p04193_A,04193,A,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p04194_A,04194,A,elinor is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared
p04195_A,04195,A,brandon is just the kind of man whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to
p04196_A,04196,A,that is exactly what i think of him
p04197_A,04197,A,do not boast of it however for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him
p04198_A,04198,A,that he is patronised by you is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else
p04199_A,04199,A,but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust
p04200_A,04200,A,in defence of your prot g you can even be saucy
p04201_A,04201,A,my prot g as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature
p04202_A,04202,A,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p04203_A,04203,A,he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed
p04204_A,04204,A,perhaps his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins
p04205_A,04205,A,i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him
p04206_A,04206,A,i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body s good word and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year
p04207_A,04207,A,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p04208_A,04208,A,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart
p04209_A,04209,A,your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments
p04210_A,04210,A,no her opinions are all romantic
p04211_A,04211,A,or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist
p04212_A,04212,A,i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself
p04213_A,04213,A,this will probably be the case and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions
p04214_A,04214,A,i cannot agree with you there there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne s which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage
p04215_A,04215,A,does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives
p04216_A,04216,A,upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable
p04217_A,04217,A,oh elinor i have such a secret to tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married to mr willoughby very soon
p04218_A,04218,A,you have said so almost every day since they first met on high church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle
p04219_A,04219,A,but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair
p04220_A,04220,A,take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his
p04221_A,04221,A,i must not tell may i elinor
p04222_A,04222,A,remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them
p04223_A,04223,A,i never had any conjectures about it it was you who told me of it yourself
p04224_A,04224,A,oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it what is the gentleman s name
p04225_A,04225,A,i must not tell ma am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too
p04226_A,04226,A,yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say
p04227_A,04227,A,no that he is not he is of no profession at all
p04228_A,04228,A,margaret you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence
p04229_A,04229,A,what is the matter with brandon
p04230_A,04230,A,i hope he has had no bad news it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly
p04231_A,04231,A,no bad news colonel i hope
p04232_A,04232,A,none at all ma am i thank you
p04233_A,04233,A,was it from avignon i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse
p04234_A,04234,A,no ma am it came from town and is merely a letter of business
p04235_A,04235,A,but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a letter of business come come this won t do colonel so let us hear the truth of it
p04236_A,04236,A,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p04237_A,04237,A,perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married
p04238_A,04238,A,no indeed it is not
p04239_A,04239,A,well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well
p04240_A,04240,A,whom do you mean ma am
p04241_A,04241,A,oh you know who i mean
p04242_A,04242,A,i am particularly sorry ma am that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town
p04243_A,04243,A,in town what can you have to do in town at this time of year
p04244_A,04244,A,my own loss is great in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell
p04245_A,04245,A,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p04246_A,04246,A,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p04247_A,04247,A,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p04248_A,04248,A,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p04249_A,04249,A,you would not be six hours later if you were to defer your journey till our return
p04250_A,04250,A,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p04251_A,04251,A,there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure brandon is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing
p04252_A,04252,A,there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell well then when will you come back again
p04253_A,04253,A,i hope we shall see you at barton as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return
p04254_A,04254,A,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p04255_A,04255,A,oh he must and shall come back if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him
p04256_A,04256,A,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p04257_A,04257,A,i do not want to pry into other men s concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed of you do not go to town on horseback do you
p04258_A,04258,A,no only to honiton i shall then go post
p04259_A,04259,A,well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind
p04260_A,04260,A,i assure you it is not in my power is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood
p04261_A,04261,A,i am afraid none at all
p04262_A,04262,A,then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do
p04263_A,04263,A,i can guess what his business is however yes it is about miss williams i am sure
p04264_A,04264,A,and who is miss williams
p04265_A,04265,A,i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning
p04266_A,04266,A,where pray
p04267_A,04267,A,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p04268_A,04268,A,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p04269_A,04269,A,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself
p04270_A,04270,A,yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby
p04271_A,04271,A,mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life
p04272_A,04272,A,i am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety
p04273_A,04273,A,on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure
p04274_A,04274,A,but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct
p04275_A,04275,A,if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby s and
p04276_A,04276,A,if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done
p04277_A,04277,A,what improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent to not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded
p04278_A,04278,A,do not be alarmed nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it
p04279_A,04279,A,i am heartily glad of it may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better
p04280_A,04280,A,thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it
p04281_A,04281,A,i am to me it is faultless nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage
p04282_A,04282,A,with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose
p04283_A,04283,A,yes with all and every thing belonging to it in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton
p04284_A,04284,A,i flatter myself that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this
p04285_A,04285,A,there certainly are circumstances which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share how often did i wish when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford you are a good woman your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me
p04286_A,04286,A,is anything the matter with her is she ill
p04287_A,04287,A,yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london i have just received my dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you
p04288_A,04288,A,to london and are you going this morning
p04289_A,04289,A,almost this moment
p04290_A,04290,A,this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged and her business will not detain you from us long i hope
p04291_A,04291,A,you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth
p04292_A,04292,A,and is mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here
p04293_A,04293,A,you are too good
p04294_A,04294,A,i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination
p04295_A,04295,A,my engagements at present are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy
p04296_A,04296,A,our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor and with how heavy a heart does he travel
p04297_A,04297,A,it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here
p04298_A,04298,A,it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you
p04299_A,04299,A,can you indeed
p04300_A,04300,A,yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say
p04301_A,04301,A,nothing for you have anticipated my answer
p04302_A,04302,A,then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of
p04303_A,04303,A,i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him
p04304_A,04304,A,do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted
p04305_A,04305,A,not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us
p04306_A,04306,A,concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness
p04307_A,04307,A,i want no proof of their affection but of their engagement i do
p04308_A,04308,A,i am perfectly satisfied of both
p04309_A,04309,A,yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them
p04310_A,04310,A,i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister s love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence
p04311_A,04311,A,i confess that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other
p04312_A,04312,A,how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her
p04313_A,04313,A,no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure
p04314_A,04314,A,but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him
p04315_A,04315,A,you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed
p04316_A,04316,A,a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister s wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful
p04317_A,04317,A,i hope not i believe not i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent
p04318_A,04318,A,you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable remember elinor how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john s hands
p04319_A,04319,A,why do you not ask marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially
p04320_A,04320,A,we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens
p04321_A,04321,A,it is he it is indeed i know it is
p04322_A,04322,A,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p04323_A,04323,A,a fortnight
p04324_A,04324,A,have you been lately in sussex
p04325_A,04325,A,i was at norland about a month ago
p04326_A,04326,A,and how does dear dear norland look
p04327_A,04327,A,dear dear norland probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
p04328_A,04328,A,oh with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight
p04329_A,04329,A,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves
p04330_A,04330,A,no my feelings are not often shared not often understood but sometimes they are now edward here is barton valley look up to it and be tranquil if you can look at those hills did you ever see their equals to the left is barton park amongst those woods and plantations you may see the end of the house and there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage
p04331_A,04331,A,it is a beautiful country but these bottoms must be dirty in winter
p04332_A,04332,A,how can you think of dirt with such objects before you
p04333_A,04333,A,because among the rest of the objects before me i see a very dirty lane
p04334_A,04334,A,how strange
p04335_A,04335,A,have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the middletons pleasant people
p04336_A,04336,A,no not all we could not be more unfortunately situated
p04337_A,04337,A,marianne how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr ferrars and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them
p04338_A,04338,A,what are mrs ferrars s views for you at present edward are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself
p04339_A,04339,A,no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life
p04340_A,04340,A,but how is your fame to be established for famous you must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter
p04341_A,04341,A,i shall not attempt it i have no wish to be distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence
p04342_A,04342,A,you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate
p04343_A,04343,A,as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way greatness will not make me so
p04344_A,04344,A,strange that it would what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness
p04345_A,04345,A,grandeur has but little but wealth has much to do with it
p04346_A,04346,A,elinor for shame money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned
p04347_A,04347,A,perhaps we may come to the same point your competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say and without them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting your ideas are only more noble than mine come what is your competence
p04348_A,04348,A,about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year not more than that
p04349_A,04349,A,two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end
p04350_A,04350,A,and yet two thousand a year is a very moderate income a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands a proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less
p04351_A,04351,A,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p04352_A,04352,A,but most people do
p04353_A,04353,A,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p04354_A,04354,A,oh that they would
p04355_A,04355,A,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p04356_A,04356,A,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p04357_A,04357,A,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p04358_A,04358,A,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p04359_A,04359,A,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes
p04360_A,04360,A,i love to be reminded of the past edward whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books
p04361_A,04361,A,and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs
p04362_A,04362,A,no edward i should have something else to do with it
p04363_A,04363,A,perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume
p04364_A,04364,A,undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them
p04365_A,04365,A,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p04366_A,04366,A,she is only grown a little more grave than she was
p04367_A,04367,A,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p04368_A,04368,A,why should you think so but gaiety never was a part of my character
p04369_A,04369,A,nor do i think it a part of marianne s i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
p04370_A,04370,A,i believe you are right and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl
p04371_A,04371,A,i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge
p04372_A,04372,A,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p04373_A,04373,A,no marianne never my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour you must not confound my meaning i am guilty i confess of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention but when have i advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters
p04374_A,04374,A,you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility do you gain no ground
p04375_A,04375,A,quite the contrary
p04376_A,04376,A,my judgment is all on your side of the question but i am afraid my practice is much more on your sister s i never wish to offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility
p04377_A,04377,A,marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers
p04378_A,04378,A,she knows her own worth too well for false shame shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy
p04379_A,04379,A,but you would still be reserved and that is worse
p04380_A,04380,A,reserved am i reserved marianne
p04381_A,04381,A,yes very
p04382_A,04382,A,i do not understand you reserved how in what manner what am i to tell you what can you suppose
p04383_A,04383,A,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p04384_A,04384,A,you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
p04385_A,04385,A,i am afraid it is but too true but why should you boast of it
p04386_A,04386,A,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p04387_A,04387,A,it is very true that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning
p04388_A,04388,A,i am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world
p04389_A,04389,A,i never saw you wear a ring before edward is that fanny s hair i remember her promising to give you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker
p04390_A,04390,A,you must drink tea with us to night for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party
p04391_A,04391,A,and who knows but you may raise a dance and that will tempt you miss marianne
p04392_A,04392,A,a dance impossible who is to dance
p04393_A,04393,A,who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone
p04394_A,04394,A,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p04395_A,04395,A,i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
p04396_A,04396,A,what do you mean
p04397_A,04397,A,well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts
p04398_A,04398,A,oh edward how can you but the time will come i hope i am sure you will like him
p04399_A,04399,A,i think edward you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it you would not be able to give them so much of your time but you would be materially benefited in one particular at least you would know where to go when you left them
p04400_A,04400,A,i do assure you that i have long thought on this point as you think now it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being we never could agree in our choice of a profession i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army that was a great deal too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the subject was first started to enter it and at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since
p04401_A,04401,A,the consequence of which i suppose will be since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades as columella s
p04402_A,04402,A,they will be brought up to be as unlike myself as is possible in feeling in action in condition in every thing
p04403_A,04403,A,come come this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits edward you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy but remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state know your own happiness you want nothing but patience or give it a more fascinating name call it hope your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are so anxious for it is her duty and it will it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not a few months do
p04404_A,04404,A,well we have brought you some strangers how do you like them
p04405_A,04405,A,hush they will hear you
p04406_A,04406,A,never mind if they do it is only the palmers charlotte is very pretty i can tell you you may see her if you look this way where is marianne has she run away because we are come i see her instrument is open
p04407_A,04407,A,well what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mama how it is improved since i was here last i always thought it such a sweet place ma am turning to mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such a house for myself should not you mr palmer mr palmer does not hear me he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous
p04408_A,04408,A,you may believe how glad we all were to see them but however i can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know it was wrong in her situation i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all she expects to be confined in february
p04409_A,04409,A,no none at all
p04410_A,04410,A,here comes marianne now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
p04411_A,04411,A,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p04412_A,04412,A,why should they ask us the rent of this cottage is said to be low but we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us
p04413_A,04413,A,oh my love you must help me to persuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter
p04414_A,04414,A,i am afraid miss marianne you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today
p04415_A,04415,A,oh don t be so sly before us for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live a great way from him in the country you know not above ten miles i dare say
p04416_A,04416,A,much nearer thirty
p04417_A,04417,A,ah well there is not much difference i never was at his house but they say it is a sweet pretty place
p04418_A,04418,A,as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life
p04419_A,04419,A,is it very ugly then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose
p04420_A,04420,A,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p04421_A,04421,A,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p04422_A,04422,A,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p04423_A,04423,A,then you would be very ill bred
p04424_A,04424,A,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p04425_A,04425,A,i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred
p04426_A,04426,A,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p04427_A,04427,A,oh my dear miss dashwood i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas now pray do and come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful my love don t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland
p04428_A,04428,A,certainly i came into devonshire with no other view
p04429_A,04429,A,there now you see mr palmer expects you so you cannot refuse to come but indeed you must and shall come i am sure you will like it of all things the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now for mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming but poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced to make every body like him how charming it will be when he is in parliament won t it how i shall laugh it will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an m p but do you know he says he will never frank for me he declares he won t don t you mr palmer he cannot bear writing you know he says it is quite shocking
p04430_A,04430,A,no i never said any thing so irrational don t palm all your abuses of language upon me
p04431_A,04431,A,there now you see how droll he is this is always the way with him sometimes he won t speak to me for half a day together and then he comes out with something so droll all about any thing in the world
p04432_A,04432,A,certainly he seems very agreeable
p04433_A,04433,A,well i am so glad you do i thought you would he is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can tell you and you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come to cleveland i can t imagine why you should object to it oh dear yes i know him extremely well not that i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was at allenham mama saw him here once before but i was with my uncle at weymouth however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know
p04434_A,04434,A,upon my word you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match
p04435_A,04435,A,don t pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it in my way through town
p04436_A,04436,A,my dear mrs palmer
p04437_A,04437,A,upon my honour i did i met colonel brandon monday morning in bond street just before we left town and he told me of it directly
p04438_A,04438,A,you surprise me very much colonel brandon tell you of it surely you must be mistaken to give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel brandon to do
p04439_A,04439,A,but i do assure you it was so for all that and i will tell you how it happened when we met him he turned back and walked with us and so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and another and i said to him so colonel there is a new family come to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to mr willoughby of combe magna is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in devonshire so lately
p04440_A,04440,A,and what did the colonel say
p04441_A,04441,A,oh he did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place
p04442_A,04442,A,mr brandon was very well i hope
p04443_A,04443,A,oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing but say fine things of you
p04444_A,04444,A,i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing
p04445_A,04445,A,so do i he is such a charming man that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull mama says he was in love with your sister too i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he hardly ever falls in love with any body
p04446_A,04446,A,is mr willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire
p04447_A,04447,A,oh yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than mr willoughby wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him to own it last night i am so glad we are got acquainted at last and now i hope we shall always be great friends you can t think how much i longed to see you it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage nothing can be like it to be sure and i am so glad your sister is going to be well married i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna it is a sweet place by all accounts
p04448_A,04448,A,you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon have not you
p04449_A,04449,A,yes a great while ever since my sister married he was a particular friend of sir john s i believe he would have been very glad to have had me if he could sir john and lady middleton wished it very much but mama did not think the match good enough for me otherwise sir john would have mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been married immediately
p04450_A,04450,A,did not colonel brandon know of sir john s proposal to your mother before it was made had he never owned his affection to yourself
p04451_A,04451,A,john is in such spirits today he is full of monkey tricks how playful william is and here is my sweet little annamaria and she is always so gentle and quiet never was there such a quiet little thing
p04452_A,04452,A,poor little creatures it might have been a very sad accident
p04453_A,04453,A,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p04454_A,04454,A,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p04455_A,04455,A,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p04456_A,04456,A,i should guess so from what i have witnessed this morning
p04457_A,04457,A,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p04458_A,04458,A,i confess that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence
p04459_A,04459,A,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p04460_A,04460,A,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p04461_A,04461,A,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p04462_A,04462,A,and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always
p04463_A,04463,A,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p04464_A,04464,A,nay my dear i m sure i don t pretend to say that there an t i m sure there s a vast many smart beaux in exeter but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used to have but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil but i can t bear to see them dirty and nasty now there s mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen i suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich
p04465_A,04465,A,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p04466_A,04466,A,oh dear one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do
p04467_A,04467,A,lord anne you can talk of nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else
p04468_A,04468,A,his name is ferrars but pray do not tell it for it s a great secret
p04469_A,04469,A,ferrars mr ferrars is the happy man is he what your sister in law s brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well
p04470_A,04470,A,how can you say so anne though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well
p04471_A,04471,A,you will think my question an odd one i dare say but pray are you personally acquainted with your sister in law s mother mrs ferrars indeed i wonder at that for i thought you must have seen her at norland sometimes then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is
p04472_A,04472,A,no i know nothing of her
p04473_A,04473,A,i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way but perhaps there may be reasons i wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars
p04474_A,04474,A,i am sorry i do not if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family and therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character
p04475_A,04475,A,i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present but the time may come how soon it will come must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately connected
p04476_A,04476,A,good heavens what do you mean are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars can you be
p04477_A,04477,A,no not to mr robert ferrars i never saw him in my life but to his eldest brother you may well be surprised for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars must seem so odd that it ought to be explained and i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sisters
p04478_A,04478,A,may i ask if your engagement is of long standing
p04479_A,04479,A,we have been engaged these four years
p04480_A,04480,A,i did not know that you were even acquainted till the other day
p04481_A,04481,A,our acquaintance however is of many years date he was under my uncle s care you know a considerable while
p04482_A,04482,A,your uncle
p04483_A,04483,A,yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk of mr pratt
p04484_A,04484,A,i think i have
p04485_A,04485,A,he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near plymouth it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement was formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost always with us afterwards i was very unwilling to enter into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother but i was too young and loved him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him
p04486_A,04486,A,certainly engaged to mr edward ferrars i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me that really i beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake of person or name we cannot mean the same mr ferrars
p04487_A,04487,A,we can mean no other mr edward ferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street and brother of your sister in law mrs john dashwood is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends
p04488_A,04488,A,it is strange that i should never have heard him even mention your name
p04489_A,04489,A,no considering our situation it was not strange our first care has been to keep the matter secret you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his sister s suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it
p04490_A,04490,A,four years you have been engaged
p04491_A,04491,A,yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait poor edward it puts him quite out of heart to prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look at this face it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for i have had it above these three years i have never been able to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity
p04492_A,04492,A,you are quite in the right
p04493_A,04493,A,i am sure i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to us not to have it reach his mother for she would never approve of it i dare say i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman
p04494_A,04494,A,i certainly did not seek your confidence but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety
p04495_A,04495,A,i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you in telling you all this i have not known you long to be sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by description a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance besides in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward s mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask anne is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world t other day when edward s name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all you can t think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a year i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke sometimes i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do and on my own account too so dear as he is to me i don t think i could be equal to it what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you do yourself
p04496_A,04496,A,pardon me but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you
p04497_A,04497,A,to be sure his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at barton he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill
p04498_A,04498,A,did he come from your uncle s then when he visited us
p04499_A,04499,A,oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us did you think he came directly from town
p04500_A,04500,A,no i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth
p04501_A,04501,A,did not you think him sadly out of spirits
p04502_A,04502,A,we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived
p04503_A,04503,A,i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected poor fellow i am afraid it is just the same with him now for he writes in wretched spirits i heard from him just before i left exeter you know his hand i dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual he was tired i dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible writing to each other is the only comfort we have in such long separations yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him
p04504_A,04504,A,i am glad you are not going to finish poor little annamaria s basket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight and we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to morrow and then i hope she will not much mind it
p04505_A,04505,A,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p04506_A,04506,A,you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done
p04507_A,04507,A,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p04508_A,04508,A,perhaps if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
p04509_A,04509,A,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p04510_A,04510,A,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p04511_A,04511,A,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p04512_A,04512,A,i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again
p04513_A,04513,A,thank you for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday
p04514_A,04514,A,offended me how could you suppose so believe me nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me
p04515_A,04515,A,and yet i do assure you there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable i felt sure that you was angry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure
p04516_A,04516,A,indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother
p04517_A,04517,A,he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh i have been always used to a very small income and could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her we must wait it may be for many years with almost every other man in the world it would be an alarming prospect but edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of i know
p04518_A,04518,A,that conviction must be every thing to you and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed
p04519_A,04519,A,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived
p04520_A,04520,A,but what are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth
p04521_A,04521,A,if we could be certain that it would be only for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and the idea of that for edward s sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures
p04522_A,04522,A,and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason do you know mr robert ferrars
p04523_A,04523,A,a great coxcomb oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say
p04524_A,04524,A,no sister you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs
p04525_A,04525,A,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p04526_A,04526,A,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p04527_A,04527,A,i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest
p04528_A,04528,A,i should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough to her husband
p04529_A,04529,A,but mrs john dashwood would not much approve of edward s going into orders
p04530_A,04530,A,then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little
p04531_A,04531,A,i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood
p04532_A,04532,A,no on such a subject i certainly will not you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes
p04533_A,04533,A,indeed you wrong me i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours and i do really believe that if you was to say to me i should resolve upon doing it immediately
p04534_A,04534,A,this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one it raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person
p04535_A,04535,A,tis because you are an indifferent person that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood
p04536_A,04536,A,certainly not
p04537_A,04537,A,i am sorry for that it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure your brother and sister will ask you to come to them
p04538_A,04538,A,it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do
p04539_A,04539,A,oh lord i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do beg you will favour me with your company for i ve quite set my heart upon it don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me for i shan t put myself at all out of my way for you it will only be sending betty by the coach and i hope i can afford that we three shall be able to go very well in my chaise and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my daughters i am sure your mother will not object to it for i have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you and if i don t get one of you at least well married before i have done with you it shall not be my fault i shall speak a good word for you to all the young men you may depend upon it
p04540_A,04540,A,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it
p04541_A,04541,A,nay i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marianne s company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together because if they got tired of me they might talk to one another and laugh at my odd ways behind my back but one or the other if not both of them i must have lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me come miss marianne let us strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her mind by and bye why so much the better
p04542_A,04542,A,i am delighted with the plan it is exactly what i could wish margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves when you and the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music you will find margaret so improved when you come back again i have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one it is very right that you should go to town i would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of london you will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt and in all probability you will see your brother and whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife when i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other
p04543_A,04543,A,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed
p04544_A,04544,A,and what is my dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward do not let me hear a word about the expense of it
p04545_A,04545,A,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence
p04546_A,04546,A,that is very true but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady middleton
p04547_A,04547,A,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p04548_A,04548,A,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family
p04549_A,04549,A,i am writing home marianne had not you better defer your letter for a day or two
p04550_A,04550,A,oh colonel i am monstrous glad to see you sorry i could not come before beg your pardon but i have been forced to look about me a little and settle my matters for it is a long while since i have been at home and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time and then i have had cartwright to settle with lord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner but pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should be in town today
p04551_A,04551,A,i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmer s where i have been dining
p04552_A,04552,A,oh you did well and how do they all do at their house how does charlotte do i warrant you she is a fine size by this time
p04553_A,04553,A,mrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned to tell you that you will certainly see her to morrow
p04554_A,04554,A,mr palmer will be so happy to see you what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama i forget what it was now but it was something so droll
p04555_A,04555,A,has no letter been left here for me since we went out are you quite sure of it are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note how very odd
p04556_A,04556,A,if this open weather holds much longer sir john will not like leaving barton next week tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart
p04557_A,04557,A,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight
p04558_A,04558,A,at any rate i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week
p04559_A,04559,A,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p04560_A,04560,A,don t you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor there seems to me a very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon good god he has been here while we were out
p04561_A,04561,A,depend upon it he will call again tomorrow
p04562_A,04562,A,no ma am for my mistress
p04563_A,04563,A,it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking
p04564_A,04564,A,you are expecting a letter then
p04565_A,04565,A,yes a little not much
p04566_A,04566,A,you have no confidence in me marianne
p04567_A,04567,A,nay elinor this reproach from you you who have confidence in no one
p04568_A,04568,A,me indeed marianne i have nothing to tell
p04569_A,04569,A,i thought you were both in devonshire
p04570_A,04570,A,did you
p04571_A,04571,A,when do you go back again
p04572_A,04572,A,your sister looks unwell to day your sister seems out of spirits your sister s engagement to mr willoughby is very generally known
p04573_A,04573,A,it cannot be generally known for her own family do not know it
p04574_A,04574,A,i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally talked of
p04575_A,04575,A,how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned
p04576_A,04576,A,good heavens he is there he is there oh why does he not look at me why cannot i speak to him
p04577_A,04577,A,pray pray be composed and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet
p04578_A,04578,A,good god willoughby what is the meaning of this have you not received my letters will you not shake hands with me
p04579_A,04579,A,i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings at home my card was not lost i hope
p04580_A,04580,A,but have you not received my notes here is some mistake i am sure some dreadful mistake what can be the meaning of it tell me willoughby for heaven s sake tell me what is the matter
p04581_A,04581,A,yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me
p04582_A,04582,A,go to him elinor and force him to come to me tell him i must see him again must speak to him instantly i cannot rest i shall not have a moment s peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other oh go to him this moment
p04583_A,04583,A,how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not the place for explanations wait only till tomorrow marianne may i ask
p04584_A,04584,A,upon my word i never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life my girls were nothing to her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as for miss marianne she is quite an altered creature i hope from the bottom of my heart he won t keep her waiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn pray when are they to be married
p04585_A,04585,A,and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married
p04586_A,04586,A,for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you talk so don t we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met did not i see them together in devonshire every day and all day long and did not i know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes come come this won t do because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long i tell every body of it and so does charlotte
p04587_A,04587,A,poor elinor how unhappy i make you
p04588_A,04588,A,i only wish there were any thing i could do which might be of comfort to you
p04589_A,04589,A,oh elinor i am miserable indeed
p04590_A,04590,A,exert yourself dear marianne if you would not kill yourself and all who love you think of your mother think of her misery while you suffer for her sake you must exert yourself
p04591_A,04591,A,i cannot i cannot leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me but do not torture me so oh how easy for those who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion happy happy elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer
p04592_A,04592,A,do you call me happy marianne ah if you knew and can you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched
p04593_A,04593,A,forgive me forgive me i know you feel for me i know what a heart you have but yet you are you must be happy edward loves you what oh what can do away such happiness as that
p04594_A,04594,A,many many circumstances
p04595_A,04595,A,no no no he loves you and only you you can have no grief
p04596_A,04596,A,i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state
p04597_A,04597,A,and you will never see me otherwise mine is a misery which nothing can do away
p04598_A,04598,A,you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful
p04599_A,04599,A,engagement there has been no engagement
p04600_A,04600,A,no engagement
p04601_A,04601,A,no he is not so unworthy as you believe him he has broken no faith with me
p04602_A,04602,A,but he told you that he loved you
p04603_A,04603,A,yes no never absolutely it was every day implied but never professedly declared sometimes i thought it had been but it never was
p04604_A,04604,A,yet you wrote to him
p04605_A,04605,A,yes could that be wrong after all that had passed but i cannot talk i felt myself to be as solemnly engaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other
p04606_A,04606,A,i can believe it but unfortunately he did not feel the same
p04607_A,04607,A,he did feel the same elinor for weeks and weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest supplication had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton the morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby
p04608_A,04608,A,dearest marianne who but himself by whom can he have been instigated
p04609_A,04609,A,by all the world rather than by his own heart i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty this woman of whom he writes whoever she be or any one in short but your own dear self mama and edward may have been so barbarous to bely me beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well
p04610_A,04610,A,whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence
p04611_A,04611,A,no no misery such as mine has no pride i care not who knows that i am wretched the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but i cannot i must feel i must be wretched and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can
p04612_A,04612,A,but for my mother s sake and mine
p04613_A,04613,A,i would do more than for my own but to appear happy when i am so miserable oh who can require it it is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours cruel cruel nothing can acquit you elinor nothing can whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing myself that is unpardonable willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words oh barbarously insolent elinor can he be justified
p04614_A,04614,A,no marianne in no possible way
p04615_A,04615,A,and yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her who is she who can she be whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one no one he talked to me only of myself elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone to morrow
p04616_A,04616,A,to morrow marianne
p04617_A,04617,A,yes why should i stay here i came only for willoughby s sake and now who cares for me who regards me
p04618_A,04618,A,it would be impossible to go to morrow we owe mrs jennings much more than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that
p04619_A,04619,A,poor soul how it grieves me to see her and i declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine and the dried cherries too lord nothing seems to do her any good i am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would send all over the town for it well it is the oddest thing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you they care no more about such things
p04620_A,04620,A,the lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich
p04621_A,04621,A,fifty thousand pounds my dear did you ever see her a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married a very wealthy man but the family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it won t come before it s wanted for they say he is all to pieces no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters well it don t signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a richer girl is ready to have him why don t he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once i warrant you miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round but that won t do now a days nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age
p04622_A,04622,A,do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is is she said to be amiable
p04623_A,04623,A,i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one day miss walker hinted to her that she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could never agree
p04624_A,04624,A,and who are the ellisons
p04625_A,04625,A,her guardians my dear but now she is of age and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made what now your poor sister is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone well by and by we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there no round game she cares for
p04626_A,04626,A,dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary marianne i dare say will not leave her room again this evening i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed for i am sure she wants rest
p04627_A,04627,A,aye i believe that will be best for her let her name her own supper and go to bed lord no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that and so the letter that came today finished it poor soul i am sure if i had had a notion of it i would not have joked her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it if i had my senses about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it but i shall see them tomorrow
p04628_A,04628,A,it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution mrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister their own good nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe
p04629_A,04629,A,oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world you saw i did not all dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very thoughtful and considerate especially if i give them a hint as i certainly will for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner tis blown over and forgot and what good does talking ever do you know
p04630_A,04630,A,in this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for the sake of every one concerned in it make it unfit to become the public conversation i must do this justice to mr willoughby he has broken no positive engagement with my sister
p04631_A,04631,A,law my dear don t pretend to defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her all over allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter well my dear tis a true saying about an ill wind for it will be all the better for colonel brandon he will have her at last aye that he will mind me now if they an t married by mid summer lord how he ll chuckle over this news i hope he will come tonight it will be all to one a better match for your sister two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love child indeed aye i had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then what does it signify delaford is a nice place i can tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner lord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there then there is a dove cote some delightful stew ponds and a very pretty canal and every thing in short that one could wish for and moreover it is close to the church and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike road so tis never dull for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house you may see all the carriages that pass along oh tis a nice place a butcher hard by in the village and the parsonage house within a stone s throw to my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park where they are forced to send three miles for their meat and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down if we can but put willoughby out of her head
p04632_A,04632,A,you had better leave me
p04633_A,04633,A,my dear i have just recollected that i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it for your sister my poor husband how fond he was of it whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world do take it to your sister
p04634_A,04634,A,dear ma am how good you are but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope almost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me leave i will drink the wine myself
p04635_A,04635,A,the colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows nothing of it do tell him my dear
p04636_A,04636,A,marianne is not well she has been indisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed
p04637_A,04637,A,perhaps then what i heard this morning may be there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first
p04638_A,04638,A,what did you hear
p04639_A,04639,A,that a gentleman whom i had reason to think in short that a man whom i knew to be engaged but how shall i tell you if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared
p04640_A,04640,A,you mean mr willoughby s marriage with miss grey yes we do know it all this seems to have been a day of general elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us mr willoughby is unfathomable where did you hear it
p04641_A,04641,A,in a stationer s shop in pall mall where i had business two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all the name of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught my attention and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey it was no longer to be a secret it would take place even within a few weeks with many particulars of preparations and other matters one thing especially i remember because it served to identify the man still more as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to combe magna his seat in somersetshire my astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what i felt the communicative lady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop till they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey s guardian
p04642_A,04642,A,it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in any thing we may find an explanation
p04643_A,04643,A,it may be so but willoughby is capable at least i think and your sister how did she
p04644_A,04644,A,her sufferings have been very severe i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short it has been it is a most cruel affliction till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard and even now perhaps but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her he has been very deceitful and in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him
p04645_A,04645,A,ah there is indeed but your sister does not i think you said so she does not consider quite as you do
p04646_A,04646,A,now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good
p04647_A,04647,A,who can this be so early too i thought we had been safe
p04648_A,04648,A,it is colonel brandon we are never safe from him
p04649_A,04649,A,he will not come in as mrs jennings is from home
p04650_A,04650,A,i met mrs jennings in bond street and she encouraged me to come on and i was the more easily encouraged because i thought it probable that i might find you alone which i was very desirous of doing my object my wish my sole wish in desiring it i hope i believe it is is to be a means of giving comfort no i must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction lasting conviction to your sister s mind my regard for her for yourself for your mother will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard nothing but an earnest desire of being useful i think i am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that i am right is there not some reason to fear i may be wrong
p04651_A,04651,A,i understand you you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it
p04652_A,04652,A,you shall and to be brief when i quitted barton last october but this will give you no idea i must go farther back you will find me a very awkward narrator miss dashwood i hardly know where to begin a short account of myself i believe will be necessary and it shall be a short one on such a subject can i have little temptation to be diffuse you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you a conversation between us one evening at barton park it was the evening of a dance in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure your sister marianne
p04653_A,04653,A,indeed i have not forgotten it
p04654_A,04654,A,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too
p04655_A,04655,A,good heavens could it be could willoughby
p04656_A,04656,A,the first news that reached me of her came in a letter from herself last october it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which i believe gave offence to some little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable but had he known it what would it have availed would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address he had left her promising to return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her
p04657_A,04657,A,this is beyond every thing
p04658_A,04658,A,his character is now before you expensive dissipated and worse than both knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that she was to marry him guess what i must have felt for all your sakes when i came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth though irresolute what to do when it was known my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then but now you will comprehend it to suffer you all to be so deceived to see your sister but what could i do i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what were his designs on her whatever they may have been however she may now and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self reproach which must attend her through life surely this comparison must have its use with her she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you you must know best what will be its effect but had i not seriously and from my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others
p04659_A,04659,A,i have been more pained by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do now though at first she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier have you ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton
p04660_A,04660,A,yes once i have one meeting was unavoidable
p04661_A,04661,A,what have you met him to
p04662_A,04662,A,i could meet him no other way eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct we returned unwounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust
p04663_A,04663,A,is she still in town
p04664_A,04664,A,i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word
p04665_A,04665,A,well my dear and how did you travel
p04666_A,04666,A,not in the stage i assure you we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did
p04667_A,04667,A,oh oh very pretty indeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you
p04668_A,04668,A,there now everybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why my cousins say they are sure i have made a conquest but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour s end to another nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house said i
p04669_A,04669,A,aye aye that is very pretty talking but it won t do the doctor is the man i see
p04670_A,04670,A,no indeed and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of
p04671_A,04671,A,i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashwood when they come to town
p04672_A,04672,A,no i do not think we shall
p04673_A,04673,A,oh yes i dare say you will what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together
p04674_A,04674,A,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p04675_A,04675,A,i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood i am sorry she is not well
p04676_A,04676,A,you are very good my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation
p04677_A,04677,A,i wished very much to call upon you yesterday but it was impossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrars harry was vastly pleased this morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so much to do on first coming to town i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street and be introduced to your friend mrs jennings i understand she is a woman of very good fortune and the middletons too you must introduce me to them as my mother in law s relations i shall be happy to show them every respect they are excellent neighbours to you in the country i understand
p04678_A,04678,A,excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express
p04679_A,04679,A,i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed but so it ought to be they are people of large fortune they are related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing edward brought us a most charming account of the place the most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure you who is colonel brandon is he a man of fortune
p04680_A,04680,A,yes he has very good property in dorsetshire
p04681_A,04681,A,i am glad of it he seems a most gentlemanlike man and i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life
p04682_A,04682,A,me brother what do you mean
p04683_A,04683,A,he likes you i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it what is the amount of his fortune
p04684_A,04684,A,i believe about two thousand a year
p04685_A,04685,A,two thousand a year elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much for your sake
p04686_A,04686,A,indeed i believe you but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me
p04687_A,04687,A,you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken a very little trouble on your side secures him perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it but some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him in spite of himself and there can be no reason why you should not try for him it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side in short you know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable you have too much sense not to see all that colonel brandon must be the man and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family it is a match that must give universal satisfaction in short it is a kind of thing that will be exceedingly welcome to all parties that is i mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you and her mother too mrs ferrars a very good natured woman i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other day it would be something remarkable now something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time and yet it is not very unlikely
p04688_A,04688,A,is mr edward ferrars going to be married
p04689_A,04689,A,it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation he has a most excellent mother mrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if the match takes place the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time a thousand a year is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit to give you another instance of her liberality the other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now she put bank notes into fanny s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here
p04690_A,04690,A,your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one
p04691_A,04691,A,not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money
p04692_A,04692,A,more than you think it really and intrinsically worth
p04693_A,04693,A,why i hope not that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands i must have sold out to very great loss other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars s kindness is
p04694_A,04694,A,certainly and assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances
p04695_A,04695,A,another year or two may do much towards it but however there is still a great deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanny s green house and nothing but the plan of the flower garden marked out
p04696_A,04696,A,where is the green house to be
p04697_A,04697,A,upon the knoll behind the house the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden will slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have a great deal to leave
p04698_A,04698,A,nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which will descend to her children
p04699_A,04699,A,but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of
p04700_A,04700,A,and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us
p04701_A,04701,A,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises
p04702_A,04702,A,but she raises none in those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far
p04703_A,04703,A,why to be sure people have little have very little in their power but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin is she ill
p04704_A,04704,A,she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks
p04705_A,04705,A,hum very pretty
p04706_A,04706,A,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p04707_A,04707,A,beautifully indeed but she does every thing well
p04708_A,04708,A,this is admiration of a very particular kind what is miss morton to us who knows or who cares for her it is elinor of whom we think and speak
p04709_A,04709,A,miss morton is lord morton s daughter
p04710_A,04710,A,ah poor dear
p04711_A,04711,A,my dear friend i come to talk to you of my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it
p04712_A,04712,A,she was certainly very civil to you
p04713_A,04713,A,civil did you see nothing but only civility i saw a vast deal more such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me no pride no hauteur and your sister just the same all sweetness and affability
p04714_A,04714,A,undoubtedly if they had known your engagement nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you but as that was not the case
p04715_A,04715,A,i guessed you would say so but there was no reason in the world why mrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not and her liking me is every thing you shan t talk me out of my satisfaction i am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think mrs ferrars is a charming woman and so is your sister they are both delightful women indeed i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashwood was are you ill miss dashwood you seem low you don t speak sure you an t well
p04716_A,04716,A,i never was in better health
p04717_A,04717,A,dear edward this is a moment of great happiness this would almost make amends for every thing oh don t think of me don t think of my health elinor is well you see that must be enough for us both
p04718_A,04718,A,do you like london
p04719_A,04719,A,not at all i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you are what you always were i think elinor we must employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton in a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now but why were you not there edward why did you not come
p04720_A,04720,A,i was engaged elsewhere
p04721_A,04721,A,engaged but what was that when such friends were to be met
p04722_A,04722,A,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p04723_A,04723,A,what can bring her here so often could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing to edward
p04724_A,04724,A,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves
p04725_A,04725,A,i do not see how it can be done without affronting lady middleton for they spend every day with her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shows but they are lady middleton s visitors how can i ask them away from her
p04726_A,04726,A,they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations
p04727_A,04727,A,lord my dear miss dashwood have you heard the news
p04728_A,04728,A,no ma am what is it
p04729_A,04729,A,something so strange but you shall hear it all when i got to mr palmer s i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child she was sure it was very ill it cried and fretted and was all over pimples so i looked at it directly and says i and nurse said just the same but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child he said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and then charlotte was easy and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper
p04730_A,04730,A,what is fanny ill
p04731_A,04731,A,how long has this been known to you elinor has he written to you
p04732_A,04732,A,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement
p04733_A,04733,A,four months have you known of this four months what while attending me in all my misery has this been on your heart and i have reproached you for being happy
p04734_A,04734,A,it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse
p04735_A,04735,A,four months so calm so cheerful how have you been supported
p04736_A,04736,A,by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother and once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you
p04737_A,04737,A,four months and yet you loved him
p04738_A,04738,A,yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her
p04739_A,04739,A,if such is your way of thinking if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your resolution your self command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at they are brought more within my comprehension
p04740_A,04740,A,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy
p04741_A,04741,A,you have heard i suppose of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday your sister has suffered dreadfully mrs ferrars too in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome poor fanny she was in hysterics all yesterday but i would not alarm you too much donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution equal to any thing she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel she says she never shall think well of anybody again and one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived meeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness had been shown so much confidence had been placed it was quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she had asked these young women to her house merely because she thought they deserved some attention were harmless well behaved girls and would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and marianne to be with us while your kind friend there was attending her daughter and now to be so rewarded says poor fanny in her affectionate way what poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny broke it to her is not to be described while she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person such a suspicion could never have entered her head if she suspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be in that quarter said she she was quite in an agony we consulted together however as to what should be done and at last she determined to send for edward he came but i am sorry to relate what ensued all that mrs ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments and fanny s entreaties was of no avail duty affection every thing was disregarded i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before his mother explained to him her liberal designs in case of his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on him the norfolk estate which clear of land tax brings in a good thousand a year offered even when matters grew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition to this if he still persisted in this low connection represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match his own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all she would never see him again and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it
p04742_A,04742,A,gracious god can this be possible
p04743_A,04743,A,well may you wonder marianne at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these your exclamation is very natural all this however was urged in vain edward said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement he would stand to it cost him what it might
p04744_A,04744,A,then he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband
p04745_A,04745,A,i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam miss lucy steele is i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for mrs jennings we all wish her extremely happy and mrs ferrars s conduct throughout the whole has been such as every conscientious good mother in like circumstances would adopt it has been dignified and liberal edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be a bad one
p04746_A,04746,A,well sir and how did it end
p04747_A,04747,A,i am sorry to say ma am in a most unhappy rupture edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice he left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do not know for we of course can make no inquiry
p04748_A,04748,A,poor young man and what is to become of him
p04749_A,04749,A,what indeed ma am it is a melancholy consideration born to the prospect of such affluence i cannot conceive a situation more deplorable the interest of two thousand pounds how can a man live on it and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for his own folly within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand five hundred a year for miss morton has thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition we must all feel for him and the more so because it is totally out of our power to assist him
p04750_A,04750,A,poor young man i am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house and so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodgings and taverns
p04751_A,04751,A,if he would only have done as well by himself as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must be out of anybody s power to assist him and there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all his mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edward s on proper conditions i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business
p04752_A,04752,A,well that is her revenge everybody has a way of their own but i don t think mine would be to make one son independent because another had plagued me
p04753_A,04753,A,can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own poor edward i feel for him sincerely
p04754_A,04754,A,i am so glad to meet you for i wanted to see you of all things in the world i suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it is she angry
p04755_A,04755,A,not at all i believe with you
p04756_A,04756,A,that is a good thing and lady middleton is she angry
p04757_A,04757,A,i cannot suppose it possible that she should be
p04758_A,04758,A,i am monstrous glad of it good gracious i have had such a time of it i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life she vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again so long as she lived but now she is quite come to and we are as good friends as ever look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night there now you are going to laugh at me too but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is the doctor s favourite colour i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say so my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes i do not know which way to look before them well but miss dashwood people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars s declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill natured reports to be spread abroad whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain
p04759_A,04759,A,i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure you
p04760_A,04760,A,oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one can t repeat such kind of things you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons
p04761_A,04761,A,i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them you were all in the same room together were not you
p04762_A,04762,A,no indeed not us la miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by oh for shame to be sure you must know better than that no no they were shut up in the drawing room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door
p04763_A,04763,A,how have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself how could you behave so unfairly by your sister
p04764_A,04764,A,oh la there is nothing in that i only stood at the door and heard what i could and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a chimney board on purpose to hear what we said edward talks of going to oxford soon but now he is lodging at no pall mall what an ill natured woman his mother is an t she and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shan t say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for and for my part i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight edward have got some business at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious i d lay my life i know what my cousins will say when they hear of it they will tell me i should write to the doctor to get edward the curacy of his new living i know they will but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world la i shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a thing i write to the doctor indeed
p04765_A,04765,A,well it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready
p04766_A,04766,A,cleveland no i cannot go to cleveland
p04767_A,04767,A,you forget that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of
p04768_A,04768,A,ah colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods for they are quite resolved upon going home from the palmers and how forlorn we shall be when i come back lord we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats
p04769_A,04769,A,i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
p04770_A,04770,A,i have heard of the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered from his family for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman have i been rightly informed is it so the cruelty the impolitic cruelty of dividing or attempting to divide two young people long attached to each other is terrible mrs ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to i have seen mr ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with him he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more i understand that he intends to take orders will you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this day s post is his if he think it worth his acceptance but that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it were more valuable it is a rectory but a small one the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 200 per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income such as it is however my pleasure in presenting it to him will be very great pray assure him of it
p04771_A,04771,A,the smallness of the house i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income
p04772_A,04772,A,well miss dashwood i do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you for though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing i could not help catching enough to understand his business and i assure you i never was better pleased in my life and i wish you joy of it with all my heart
p04773_A,04773,A,thank you ma am it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life
p04774_A,04774,A,lord my dear you are very modest i an t the least astonished at it in the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more likely to happen
p04775_A,04775,A,you judged from your knowledge of the colonel s general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur
p04776_A,04776,A,opportunity oh as to that when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity well my dear i wish you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i shall soon know where to look for them
p04777_A,04777,A,you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose
p04778_A,04778,A,aye my dear that i do indeed and as to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever i saw
p04779_A,04779,A,he spoke of its being out of repair
p04780_A,04780,A,well and whose fault is that why don t he repair it who should do it but himself well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be quite alone i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company and besides you must long to tell your sister all about it
p04781_A,04781,A,certainly ma am i shall tell marianne of it but i shall not mention it at present to any body else
p04782_A,04782,A,oh very well then you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think of going as far as holborn to day
p04783_A,04783,A,no ma am not even lucy if you please one day s delay will not be very material and till i have written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else i shall do that directly it is of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination
p04784_A,04784,A,oh ho i understand you mr ferrars is to be the man well so much the better for him ay to be sure he must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad to find things are so forward between you but my dear is not this rather out of character should not the colonel write himself sure he is the proper person
p04785_A,04785,A,colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars than himself
p04786_A,04786,A,and so you are forced to do it well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you you know your own concerns best so goodby my dear i have not heard of any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed i have just been thinking of betty s sister my dear i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress but whether she would do for a lady s maid i am sure i can t tell she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle however you will think of all that at your leisure
p04787_A,04787,A,mrs jennings told me that you wished to speak with me at least i understood her so or i certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner though at the same time i should have been extremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister especially as it will most likely be some time it is not probable that i should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again i go to oxford tomorrow
p04788_A,04788,A,you would not have gone however without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person mrs jennings was quite right in what she said i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper i am charged with a most agreeable office colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well judging a friend and to join in his wish that the living it is about two hundred a year were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such in short as might establish all your views of happiness
p04789_A,04789,A,colonel brandon
p04790_A,04790,A,yes colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which i am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion
p04791_A,04791,A,colonel brandon give me a living can it be possible
p04792_A,04792,A,the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where
p04793_A,04793,A,no not to find it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all i feel it i would express it if i could but as you well know i am no orator
p04794_A,04794,A,you are very much mistaken i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandon s discernment of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift as a friend of mine of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation
p04795_A,04795,A,colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman
p04796_A,04796,A,indeed i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house it is particularly important that he should be all this
p04797_A,04797,A,colonel brandon i think lodges in st james street i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man
p04798_A,04798,A,well my dear i sent you up the young man did not i do right and i suppose you had no great difficulty you did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal
p04799_A,04799,A,no ma am that was not very likely
p04800_A,04800,A,well and how soon will he be ready for it seems all to depend upon that
p04801_A,04801,A,really i know so little of these kind of forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordination
p04802_A,04802,A,two or three months lord my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out of patience and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him sure somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is in orders already
p04803_A,04803,A,my dear ma am what can you be thinking of why colonel brandon s only object is to be of use to mr ferrars
p04804_A,04804,A,lord bless you my dear sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr ferrars aye aye the parsonage is but a small one and very likely may be out of repair but to hear a man apologising as i thought for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground floor and i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds and to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage it seems quite ridiculous but my dear we must touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it
p04805_A,04805,A,but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living s being enough to allow them to marry
p04806_A,04806,A,fanny is in her own room i suppose i will go to her presently for i am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing you very far from it indeed now especially there cannot be but however you and marianne were always great favourites why would not marianne come i am not sorry to see you alone for i have a good deal to say to you this living of colonel brandon s can it be true has he really given it to edward i heard it yesterday by chance and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it
p04807_A,04807,A,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward
p04808_A,04808,A,really well this is very astonishing no relationship no connection between them and now that livings fetch such a price what was the value of this
p04809_A,04809,A,about two hundred a year
p04810_A,04810,A,very well and for the next presentation to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon he might have got i dare say fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person s death now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon s sense i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon it it is truly astonishing what could be the colonel s motive
p04811_A,04811,A,a very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars
p04812_A,04812,A,well well whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky man you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though i have broke it to her and she bears it vastly well she will not like to hear it much talked of mrs ferrars knows nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all
p04813_A,04813,A,but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent
p04814_A,04814,A,ah elinor your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son
p04815_A,04815,A,you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time
p04816_A,04816,A,you wrong her exceedingly mrs ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world we think now of robert s marrying miss morton
p04817_A,04817,A,the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair
p04818_A,04818,A,choice how do you mean
p04819_A,04819,A,i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert
p04820_A,04820,A,we may treat it as a joke but upon my soul it is a most serious business poor edward he is ruined for ever i am extremely sorry for it for i know him to be a very good hearted creature as well meaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world you must not judge of him miss dashwood from your slight acquaintance poor edward his manners are certainly not the happiest in nature but we are not all born you know with the same powers the same address poor fellow to see him in a circle of strangers to be sure it was pitiable enough but upon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom and i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life as when it all burst forth i could not believe it my mother was the first person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her that was what i said immediately i was most uncommonly shocked indeed poor edward he has done for himself completely shut himself out for ever from all decent society but as i directly said to my mother i am not in the least surprised at it from his style of education it was always to be expected my poor mother was half frantic
p04821_A,04821,A,have you ever seen the lady
p04822_A,04822,A,is mama coming
p04823_A,04823,A,not yet but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton
p04824_A,04824,A,miss dashwood for half an hour for ten minutes i entreat you to stay
p04825_A,04825,A,no sir i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house
p04826_A,04826,A,had they told me that mr palmer and all his relations were at the devil it would not have turned me from the door my business is with you and only you
p04827_A,04827,A,with me well sir be quick and if you can less violent
p04828_A,04828,A,sit down and i will be both
p04829_A,04829,A,pray be quick sir i have no time to spare
p04830_A,04830,A,your sister is out of danger i heard it from the servant god be praised but is it true is it really true for god s sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not
p04831_A,04831,A,we hope she is
p04832_A,04832,A,had i known as much half an hour ago but since i am here what does it signify for once miss dashwood it will be the last time perhaps let us be cheerful together i am in a fine mood for gaiety tell me honestly do you think me most a knave or a fool
p04833_A,04833,A,mr willoughby i advise you at present to return to combe i am not at leisure to remain with you longer whatever your business may be with me it will be better recollected and explained to morrow
p04834_A,04834,A,i understand you yes i am very drunk a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough to over set me
p04835_A,04835,A,at marlborough
p04836_A,04836,A,yes i left london this morning at eight o clock and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough
p04837_A,04837,A,mr willoughby you ought to feel and i certainly do that after what has passed your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse what is it that you mean by it
p04838_A,04838,A,i mean if i can to make you hate me one degree less than you do now i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though i have been always a blockhead i have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma from your sister
p04839_A,04839,A,is this the real reason of your coming
p04840_A,04840,A,upon my soul it is
p04841_A,04841,A,if that is all you may be satisfied already for marianne does she has long forgiven you
p04842_A,04842,A,has she then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds now will you listen to me i do not know how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me perhaps you will hardly think the better of me it is worth the trial however and you shall hear every thing when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before your sister s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind it is astonishing when i reflect on what it was and what she was that my heart should have been so insensible but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection
p04843_A,04843,A,it is hardly worth while mr willoughby for you to relate or for me to listen any longer such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject
p04844_A,04844,A,i insist on you hearing the whole of it my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my debts and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant it had been for some time my intention to re establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune to attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to be thought of and with a meanness selfishness cruelty which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of returning it but one thing may be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i did not then know what it was to love but have i ever known it well may it be doubted for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice or what is more could i have sacrificed hers but i have done it to avoid a comparative poverty which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence lost every thing that could make it a blessing
p04845_A,04845,A,you did then believe yourself at one time attached to her
p04846_A,04846,A,to have resisted such attractions to have withstood such tenderness is there a man on earth who could have done it yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless even then however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed i will not reason here nor will i stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound the event has proved that i was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever at last however my resolution was taken and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display but in the interim in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass before i could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to ruin all my resolution and with it all my comfort a discovery took place mrs smith had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection but i need not explain myself farther your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago
p04847_A,04847,A,i have i have heard it all and how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension
p04848_A,04848,A,remember from whom you received the account could it be an impartial one i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me i do not mean to justify myself but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because i was a libertine she must be a saint if the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding i do not mean however to defend myself her affection for me deserved better treatment and i often with great self reproach recall the tenderness which for a very short time had the power of creating any return i wish i heartily wish it had never been but i have injured more than herself and i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind oh how infinitely superior
p04849_A,04849,A,your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl i must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her do not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay always happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence
p04850_A,04850,A,but upon my soul i did not know it i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction and common sense might have told her how to find it out
p04851_A,04851,A,well sir and what said mrs smith
p04852_A,04852,A,she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed the purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world every thing was against me the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attention the very little portion of my time that i had bestowed on her in my present visit in short it ended in a total breach by one measure i might have saved myself in the height of her morality good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza that could not be and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her house the night following this affair i was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be the struggle was great but it ended too soon my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally inclined to feel and expensive society had increased i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement but whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw her miserable and left her miserable and left her hoping never to see her again
p04853_A,04853,A,why did you call mr willoughby a note would have answered every purpose why was it necessary to call
p04854_A,04854,A,it was necessary to my own pride i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part of what had really passed between mrs smith and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body but in this our last interview of friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted rascal i was
p04855_A,04855,A,did you tell her that you should soon return
p04856_A,04856,A,i do not know what i told her less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future i cannot think of it it won t do then came your dear mother to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent my journey to town travelling with my own horses and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward every thing so inviting when i looked back at barton the picture so soothing oh it was a blessed journey
p04857_A,04857,A,well sir and this is all
p04858_A,04858,A,all no have you forgot what passed in town that infamous letter did she show it you
p04859_A,04859,A,yes i saw every note that passed
p04860_A,04860,A,when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did for i was in town the whole time what i felt is in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion my feelings were very very painful every line every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart to know that marianne was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt thunderbolts and daggers what a reproof would she have given me her taste her opinions i believe they are better known to me than my own and i am sure they are dearer
p04861_A,04861,A,this is not right mr willoughby remember that you are married relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear
p04862_A,04862,A,marianne s note by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days that in spite of the many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened because time and london business and dissipation had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married but this note made me know myself better i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that i was using her infamously but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do was to avoid you both i sent no answer to marianne intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street but at last judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the house one morning and left my name
p04863_A,04863,A,watched us out of the house
p04864_A,04864,A,even so you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you how often i was on the point of falling in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long i avoided the middletons as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common not aware of their being in town however i blundered on sir john i believe the first day of his coming and the day after i had called at mrs jennings s he asked me to a party a dance at his house in the evening had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there i should have felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him the next morning brought another short note from marianne still affectionate open artless confiding everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it i tried but could not frame a sentence but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then with my head and heart full of your sister i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone oh god holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was well it does not signify it is over now such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white as death that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me it was a horrid sight yet when i thought of her to day as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world she was before me constantly before me as i travelled in the same look and hue well let me make haste and be gone your sister is certainly better certainly out of danger
p04865_A,04865,A,we are assured of it
p04866_A,04866,A,your poor mother too doting on marianne
p04867_A,04867,A,but the letter mr willoughby your own letter have you any thing to say about that
p04868_A,04868,A,yes yes that in particular your sister wrote to me again you know the very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the ellisons and her letter with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings it happened to catch sophia s eye before it caught mine and its size the elegance of the paper the hand writing altogether immediately gave her a suspicion some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever affecting that air of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman one loves she opened the letter directly and read its contents she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion her malice at all events it must be appeased and in short what do you think of my wife s style of letter writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not
p04869_A,04869,A,your wife the letter was in your own hand writing
p04870_A,04870,A,yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to the original was all her own her own happy thoughts and gentle diction but what could i do we were engaged every thing in preparation the day almost fixed but i am talking like a fool preparation day in honest words her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture and after all what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends in what language my answer was couched it must have been only to one end my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance said i to myself such were my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness i copied my wife s words and parted with the last relics of marianne her three notes unluckily they were all in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence and hoarded them for ever i was forced to put them up and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me
p04871_A,04871,A,you are very wrong mr willoughby very blamable you ought not to speak in this way either of mrs willoughby or my sister you had made your own choice it was not forced on you your wife has a claim to your politeness to your respect at least she must be attached to you or she would not have married you to treat her with unkindness to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience
p04872_A,04872,A,do not talk to me of my wife she does not deserve your compassion she knew i had no regard for her when we married well married we were and came down to combe magna to be happy and afterwards returned to town to be gay and now do you pity me miss dashwood or have i said all this to no purpose am i be it only one degree am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before my intentions were not always wrong have i explained away any part of my guilt
p04873_A,04873,A,yes you have certainly removed something a little you have proved yourself on the whole less faulty than i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked but i hardly know the misery that you have inflicted i hardly know what could have made it worse
p04874_A,04874,A,will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered what i have been telling you let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours you tell me that she has forgiven me already let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart and of my present feelings will draw from her a more spontaneous more natural more gentle less dignified forgiveness tell her of my misery and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her and if you will that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever
p04875_A,04875,A,i will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called your justification but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now nor how you heard of her illness
p04876_A,04876,A,last night in drury lane lobby i ran against sir john middleton and when he saw who i was for the first time these two months he spoke to me that he had cut me ever since my marriage i had seen without surprise or resentment now however his good natured honest stupid soul full of indignation against me and concern for your sister could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to though probably he did not think it would vex me horridly as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland a letter that morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger most imminent the palmers are all gone off in a fright c i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying and dying too believing me the greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me in her latest moments for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed one person i was sure would represent me as capable of anything what i felt was dreadful my resolution was soon made and at eight o clock this morning i was in my carriage now you know all there is no use in staying here i must be off
p04877_A,04877,A,are you going back to town
p04878_A,04878,A,no to combe magna i have business there from thence to town in a day or two good bye and you do think something better of me than you did as to that i must rub through the world as well as i can domestic happiness is out of the question if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something to live for marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again well once more good bye i shall now go away and live in dread of one event
p04879_A,04879,A,what do you mean
p04880_A,04880,A,your sister s marriage
p04881_A,04881,A,you are very wrong she can never be more lost to you than she is now
p04882_A,04882,A,at last we are alone my elinor you do not yet know all my happiness colonel brandon loves marianne he has told me so himself you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your composure now had i sat down to wish for any possible good to my family i should have fixed on colonel brandon s marrying one of you as the object most desirable and i believe marianne will be the most happy with him of the two he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly i you may well believe could talk of nothing but my child he could not conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own and he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as the world now goes would not justify so warm a sympathy or rather not thinking at all i suppose giving way to irresistible feelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant affection for marianne he has loved her my elinor ever since the first moment of seeing her his regard for her infinitely surpassing anything that willoughby ever felt or feigned as much more warm as more sincere or constant which ever we are to call it has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear marianne s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man and without selfishness without encouraging a hope could he have seen her happy with another such a noble mind such openness such sincerity no one can be deceived in him
p04883_A,04883,A,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established
p04884_A,04884,A,i know it is or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men
p04885_A,04885,A,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope
p04886_A,04886,A,oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself marianne might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend not an application to a parent yet after a time i did say for at first i was quite overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage and since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every encouragement in my power time a very little time i tell him will do everything marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby his own merits must soon secure it
p04887_A,04887,A,to judge from the colonel s spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine
p04888_A,04888,A,when the weather is settled and i have recovered my strength we will take long walks together every day we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on we will walk to sir john s new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland and we will often go to the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached i know we shall be happy i know the summer will pass happily away i mean never to be later in rising than six and from that time till dinner i shall divide every moment between music and reading i have formed my plan and am determined to enter on a course of serious study our own library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement but there are many works well worth reading at the park and there are others of more modern production which i know i can borrow of colonel brandon by reading only six hours a day i shall gain in the course of a twelve month a great deal of instruction which i now feel myself to want there exactly there on that projecting mound there i fell and there i first saw willoughby i am thankful to find that i can look with so little pain on the spot shall we ever talk on that subject elinor or will it be wrong i can talk of it now i hope as i ought to do as for regret i have done with that as far as he is concerned i do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him but what they are now at present if i could be satisfied on one point if i could be allowed to think that he was not always acting a part not always deceiving me but above all if i could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him since the story of that unfortunate girl
p04889_A,04889,A,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy
p04890_A,04890,A,yes my peace of mind is doubly involved in it for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of such designs but what must it make me appear to myself what in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to
p04891_A,04891,A,how then would you account for his behaviour
p04892_A,04892,A,i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle i am not wishing him too much good when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer enough in them
p04893_A,04893,A,do you compare your conduct with his
p04894_A,04894,A,no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours
p04895_A,04895,A,our situations have borne little resemblance
p04896_A,04896,A,i wish to assure you both that i see every thing as you can desire me to do it is a great relief to me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings
p04897_A,04897,A,i know it i know it happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt
p04898_A,04898,A,i wish for no change
p04899_A,04899,A,the whole of his behaviour from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness it was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which afterwards when his own were engaged made him delay the confession of it and which finally carried him from barton his own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular his ruling principle
p04900_A,04900,A,it is very true my happiness never was his object
p04901_A,04901,A,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife
p04902_A,04902,A,i have not a doubt of it and i have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly
p04903_A,04903,A,rather say your mother s imprudence my child she must be answerable
p04904_A,04904,A,i suppose you know ma am that mr ferrars is married
p04905_A,04905,A,who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas
p04906_A,04906,A,i see mr ferrars myself ma am this morning in exeter and his lady too miss steele as was they was stopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn as i went there with a message from sally at the park to her brother who is one of the post boys i happened to look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly it was the youngest miss steele so i took off my hat and she knew me and called to me and inquired after you ma am and the young ladies especially miss marianne and bid me i should give her compliments and mr ferrars s their best compliments and service and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you but they was in a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further down for a little while but howsever when they come back they d make sure to come and see you
p04907_A,04907,A,but did she tell you she was married thomas
p04908_A,04908,A,yes ma am she smiled and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts she was always a very affable and free spoken young lady and very civil behaved so i made free to wish her joy
p04909_A,04909,A,was mr ferrars in the carriage with her
p04910_A,04910,A,yes ma am i just see him leaning back in it but he did not look up he never was a gentleman much for talking
p04911_A,04911,A,was there no one else in the carriage
p04912_A,04912,A,no ma am only they two
p04913_A,04913,A,do you know where they came from
p04914_A,04914,A,they come straight from town as miss lucy mrs ferrars told me
p04915_A,04915,A,and are they going farther westward
p04916_A,04916,A,yes ma am but not to bide long they will soon be back again and then they d be sure and call here
p04917_A,04917,A,did you see them off before you came away
p04918_A,04918,A,no ma am the horses were just coming out but i could not bide any longer i was afraid of being late
p04919_A,04919,A,did mrs ferrars look well
p04920_A,04920,A,yes ma am she said how she was very well and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady and she seemed vastly contented
p04921_A,04921,A,when do you write to colonel brandon ma am
p04922_A,04922,A,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p04923_A,04923,A,is mrs ferrars at longstaple
p04924_A,04924,A,at longstaple no my mother is in town
p04925_A,04925,A,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars
p04926_A,04926,A,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style
p04927_A,04927,A,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her
p04928_A,04928,A,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living
p04929_A,04929,A,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be
p04930_A,04930,A,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
p04931_A,04931,A,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first
p00000_B,00000,B,i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own
p00001_B,00001,B,a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own this is three times as large and you have never any odd humours my dear
p00002_B,00002,B,how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon
p00003_B,00003,B,my dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance i could not walk half so far
p00004_B,00004,B,no papa nobody thought of your walking we must go in the carriage to be sure
p00005_B,00005,B,the carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit
p00006_B,00006,B,they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you
p00007_B,00007,B,i am very glad i did think of her it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil pretty spoken girl i have a great opinion of her whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us he will be able to tell her how we all are
p00008_B,00008,B,not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire
p00009_B,00009,B,but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not catch cold
p00010_B,00010,B,dirty sir look at my shoes not a speck on them
p00011_B,00011,B,well that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast i wanted them to put off the wedding
p00012_B,00012,B,by the bye i have not wished you joy being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well how did you all behave who cried most
p00013_B,00013,B,ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
p00014_B,00014,B,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two
p00015_B,00015,B,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by
p00016_B,00016,B,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00017_B,00017,B,my dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you what a horrible idea oh no i meant only myself mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke we always say what we like to one another
p00018_B,00018,B,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00019_B,00019,B,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day
p00020_B,00020,B,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00021_B,00021,B,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00022_B,00022,B,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing
p00023_B,00023,B,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00024_B,00024,B,i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people it is the greatest amusement in the world and after such success you know every body said that mr weston would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off match making
p00025_B,00025,B,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said
p00026_B,00026,B,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that
p00027_B,00027,B,a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
p00028_B,00028,B,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously
p00029_B,00029,B,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00030_B,00030,B,mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day that will be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him
p00031_B,00031,B,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00032_B,00032,B,ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay
p00033_B,00033,B,two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people
p00034_B,00034,B,well done mrs martin you know what you are about
p00035_B,00035,B,mr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business he does not read
p00036_B,00036,B,oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he reads all them to himself but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can
p00037_B,00037,B,what sort of looking man is mr martin
p00038_B,00038,B,oh not handsome not at all handsome i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now one does not you know after a time but did you never see him he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often
p00039_B,00039,B,that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it
p00040_B,00040,B,to be sure oh yes it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeed i mean by sight
p00041_B,00041,B,i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well what do you imagine his age to be
p00042_B,00042,B,he was four and twenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day s difference which is very odd
p00043_B,00043,B,only four and twenty that is too young to settle his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable
p00044_B,00044,B,six years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old
p00045_B,00045,B,well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet
p00046_B,00046,B,to be sure so it is but they live very comfortably they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year
p00047_B,00047,B,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you
p00048_B,00048,B,yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do
p00049_B,00049,B,you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmer s daughter without education
p00050_B,00050,B,to be sure yes not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls he did not think we ever walked this road he thought we walked towards randalls most days he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again to morrow so very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected what do you think of him do you think him so very plain
p00051_B,00051,B,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility
p00052_B,00052,B,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen
p00053_B,00053,B,i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here
p00054_B,00054,B,certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man
p00055_B,00055,B,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference
p00056_B,00056,B,oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty
p00057_B,00057,B,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life
p00058_B,00058,B,there is no saying indeed
p00059_B,00059,B,but there may be pretty good guessing he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss
p00060_B,00060,B,will he indeed that will be very bad
p00061_B,00061,B,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us
p00062_B,00062,B,i wonder he did not remember the book
p00063_B,00063,B,in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day
p00064_B,00064,B,a bad thing do you really think it a bad thing why so
p00065_B,00065,B,i think they will neither of them do the other any good
p00066_B,00066,B,you surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure how very differently we feel not think they will do each other any good this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley
p00067_B,00067,B,perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle
p00068_B,00068,B,mr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life i can imagine your objection to harriet smith she is not the superior young woman which emma s friend ought to be but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself they will read together she means it i know
p00069_B,00069,B,emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old i have seen a great many lists of her drawing up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you could not
p00070_B,00070,B,i dare say that i thought so then but since we have parted i can never remember emma s omitting to do any thing i wished
p00071_B,00071,B,there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that but i who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her
p00072_B,00072,B,i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouse s family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held
p00073_B,00073,B,yes you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor
p00074_B,00074,B,thank you there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston
p00075_B,00075,B,why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne we will not despair however weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him
p00076_B,00076,B,i hope not that it is not likely no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter
p00077_B,00077,B,not i indeed i only name possibilities i do not pretend to emma s genius for foretelling and guessing i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortune but harriet smith i have not half done about harriet smith i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned her ignorance is hourly flattery how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home i am much mistaken if emma s doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life they only give a little polish
p00078_B,00078,B,i either depend more upon emma s good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance how well she looked last night
p00079_B,00079,B,oh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you very well i shall not attempt to deny emma s being pretty
p00080_B,00080,B,pretty say beautiful rather can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure
p00081_B,00081,B,i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers but i am a partial old friend
p00082_B,00082,B,such an eye the true hazle eye and so brilliant regular features open countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown up health she is loveliness itself mr knightley is not she
p00083_B,00083,B,i have not a fault to find with her person i think her all you describe i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm
p00084_B,00084,B,and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm with all dear emma s little faults she is an excellent creature where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times
p00085_B,00085,B,very well i will not plague you any more emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children i am sure of having their opinions with me
p00086_B,00086,B,i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office
p00087_B,00087,B,not at all i am much obliged to you for it it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to
p00088_B,00088,B,mrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister
p00089_B,00089,B,be satisfied i will not raise any outcry i will keep my ill humour to myself i have a very sincere interest in emma isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma i wonder what will become of her
p00090_B,00090,B,so do i very much
p00091_B,00091,B,she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home
p00092_B,00092,B,there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouse s account i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you
p00093_B,00093,B,what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain
p00094_B,00094,B,i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself i have done very little
p00095_B,00095,B,if it were admissible to contradict a lady
p00096_B,00096,B,i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before
p00097_B,00097,B,exactly so that is what principally strikes me so much superadded decision of character skilful has been the hand
p00098_B,00098,B,great has been the pleasure i am sure i never met with a disposition more truly amiable
p00099_B,00099,B,i have no doubt of it
p00100_B,00100,B,did you ever have your likeness taken harriet did you ever sit for your picture
p00101_B,00101,B,oh dear no never
p00102_B,00102,B,what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would give any money for it i almost long to attempt her likeness myself you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me it would be such a delight to have her picture
p00103_B,00103,B,let me entreat you it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls
p00104_B,00104,B,well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do harriet s features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch
p00105_B,00105,B,exactly so the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth i have not a doubt of your success pray pray attempt it as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession
p00106_B,00106,B,but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit she thinks so little of her own beauty did not you observe her manner of answering me how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn
p00107_B,00107,B,oh yes i observed it i assure you it was not lost on me but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded
p00108_B,00108,B,no great variety of faces for you i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet then here come all my attempts at three of those four children there they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mama s children ever were here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see he had nestled down his head most conveniently that s very like i am rather proud of little george the corner of the sofa is very good then here is my last my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of it mrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very like only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side yes it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him justice we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick square and as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again but for harriet s sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now
p00109_B,00109,B,no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives
p00110_B,00110,B,by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party
p00111_B,00111,B,do you think so i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know
p00112_B,00112,B,you have made her too tall emma
p00113_B,00113,B,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed
p00114_B,00114,B,it is very pretty so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold
p00115_B,00115,B,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00116_B,00116,B,but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear
p00117_B,00117,B,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness
p00118_B,00118,B,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can
p00119_B,00119,B,will you read the letter pray do i d rather you would well well is it a good letter or is it too short
p00120_B,00120,B,yes indeed a very good letter so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent for thinks strongly and clearly and when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words it is so with some men yes i understand the sort of mind vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse a better written letter harriet than i had expected
p00121_B,00121,B,well well and and what shall i do
p00122_B,00122,B,what shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard to this letter
p00123_B,00123,B,yes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me
p00124_B,00124,B,oh no no the letter had much better be all your own you will express yourself very properly i am sure there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment
p00125_B,00125,B,you think i ought to refuse him then
p00126_B,00126,B,ought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you in any doubt as to that i thought but i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it you mean to return a favourable answer i collect
p00127_B,00127,B,no i do not that is i do not mean what shall i do what would you advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do
p00128_B,00128,B,i shall not give you any advice harriet i will have nothing to do with it this is a point which you must settle with your feelings
p00129_B,00129,B,i had no notion that he liked me so very much
p00130_B,00130,B,i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you but do not imagine that i want to influence you
p00131_B,00131,B,oh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind to but if you would just advise me what i had best do no no i do not mean that as you say one s mind ought to be quite made up one should not be hesitating it is a very serious thing it will be safer to say no perhaps do you think i had better say no
p00132_B,00132,B,not for the world would i advise you either way you must be the best judge of your own happiness if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate you blush harriet does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion at this moment whom are you thinking of
p00133_B,00133,B,miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think i am right
p00134_B,00134,B,perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving dear harriet i give myself joy of this it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbey mill farm now i am secure of you for ever
p00135_B,00135,B,you could not have visited me no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world
p00136_B,00136,B,indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been you would have thrown yourself out of all good society i must have given you up
p00137_B,00137,B,dear me how should i ever have borne it it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more
p00138_B,00138,B,dear affectionate creature you banished to abbey mill farm you confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it he must have a pretty good opinion of himself
p00139_B,00139,B,i do not think he is conceited either in general at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing from and you know though he may like me it does not follow that i should and certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen people and if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration
p00140_B,00140,B,thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter
p00141_B,00141,B,oh no and it is but a short letter too oh yes very nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions i am quite determined to refuse him but how shall i do what shall i say i shall never be invited to abbey mill again
p00142_B,00142,B,nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill
p00143_B,00143,B,and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss nash would for miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linen draper
p00144_B,00144,B,one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves
p00145_B,00145,B,now he has got my letter i wonder what they are all doing whether his sisters know if he is unhappy they will be unhappy too i hope he will not mind it so very much
p00146_B,00146,B,let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name
p00147_B,00147,B,my picture but he has left my picture in bond street
p00148_B,00148,B,has he so then i know nothing of mr elton no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bond street till just before he mounts his horse to morrow it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are
p00149_B,00149,B,my dear sir do not make a stranger of me
p00150_B,00150,B,i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter emma will be happy to entertain you and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk
p00151_B,00151,B,you cannot do better sir
p00152_B,00152,B,i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey
p00153_B,00153,B,thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you
p00154_B,00154,B,i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting
p00155_B,00155,B,come you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her you have cured her of her school girl s giggle she really does you credit
p00156_B,00156,B,thank you i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may you do not often overpower me with it
p00157_B,00157,B,you are expecting her again you say this morning
p00158_B,00158,B,almost every moment she has been gone longer already than she intended
p00159_B,00159,B,something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps
p00160_B,00160,B,highbury gossips tiresome wretches
p00161_B,00161,B,harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage
p00162_B,00162,B,indeed how so of what sort
p00163_B,00163,B,a very serious sort i assure you
p00164_B,00164,B,very serious i can think of but one thing who is in love with her who makes you their confidant
p00165_B,00165,B,i have reason to think that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarter robert martin is the man her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business he is desperately in love and means to marry her
p00166_B,00166,B,he is very obliging but is he sure that harriet means to marry him
p00167_B,00167,B,well well means to make her an offer then will that do he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him i was very much pleased with all that he said i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage he is an excellent young man both as son and brother i had no hesitation in advising him to marry he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had this happened the night before last now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddard s to day and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch
p00168_B,00168,B,pray mr knightley how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday
p00169_B,00169,B,certainly i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred was not she the whole day with you
p00170_B,00170,B,come i will tell you something in return for what you have told me he did speak yesterday that is he wrote and was refused
p00171_B,00171,B,then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her what is the foolish girl about
p00172_B,00172,B,oh to be sure it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her
p00173_B,00173,B,nonsense a man does not imagine any such thing but what is the meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken
p00174_B,00174,B,i saw her answer nothing could be clearer
p00175_B,00175,B,you saw her answer you wrote her answer too emma this is your doing you persuaded her to refuse him
p00176_B,00176,B,and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her by your account he does seem to have had some scruples it is a pity that they were ever got over
p00177_B,00177,B,not harriet s equal no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you what are harriet smith s claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match
p00178_B,00178,B,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation
p00179_B,00179,B,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer
p00180_B,00180,B,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin
p00181_B,00181,B,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement
p00182_B,00182,B,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess
p00183_B,00183,B,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do
p00184_B,00184,B,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her
p00185_B,00185,B,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son
p00186_B,00186,B,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet
p00187_B,00187,B,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece
p00188_B,00188,B,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well
p00189_B,00189,B,good morning to you
p00190_B,00190,B,why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you
p00191_B,00191,B,i do not offer it for miss smith s collection being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it
p00192_B,00192,B,take it it is for you take your own
p00193_B,00193,B,mermaids and sharks nonsense my dear harriet what are you thinking of where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark give me the paper and listen for miss read miss smith that is court that is ship plain as it can be now for the cream courtship you know a very proper compliment and then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending read it in comfort to yourself there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment that i cannot have a doubt as to mr elton s intentions you are his object and you will soon receive the completest proof of it i thought it must be so i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other i am very happy i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating this is a connexion which offers nothing but good it will give you every thing that you want consideration independence a proper home it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us
p00194_B,00194,B,dear miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse whatever you say is always right and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it it is so much beyond any thing i deserve mr elton who might marry any body there cannot be two opinions about him he is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me
p00195_B,00195,B,i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that it is a certainty receive it on my judgment it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matter of fact prose
p00196_B,00196,B,it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myself the strangest things do take place
p00197_B,00197,B,when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquainted they do indeed and really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirable what courts the pre arrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage
p00198_B,00198,B,that mr elton should really be in love with me me of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week and so excellent in the church miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury dear me when i look back to the first time i saw him how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured and how beautiful we thought he looked he was arm in arm with mr cole
p00199_B,00199,B,this is an alliance which whoever whatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them
p00200_B,00200,B,yes very true how nicely you talk i love to hear you you understand every thing you and mr elton are one as clever as the other this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it
p00201_B,00201,B,i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday
p00202_B,00202,B,i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read
p00203_B,00203,B,i never read one more to the purpose certainly
p00204_B,00204,B,it is as long again as almost all we have had before
p00205_B,00205,B,i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour such things in general cannot be too short
p00206_B,00206,B,it is one thing to have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this such sweet lines these two last but how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it out oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that
p00207_B,00207,B,leave it to me you do nothing he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me
p00208_B,00208,B,oh miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book i am sure i have not got one half so good
p00209_B,00209,B,leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book
p00210_B,00210,B,oh but those two lines are
p00211_B,00211,B,the best of all granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you
p00212_B,00212,B,i shall never let that book go out of my own hands
p00213_B,00213,B,very well a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all you must let me read it to him my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charade you will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you do not let us be too solemn on the business he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade
p00214_B,00214,B,oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please
p00215_B,00215,B,yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in
p00216_B,00216,B,aye that s very just indeed that s very properly said very true it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought it nobody could have written so prettily but you emma ah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother was so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i can remember nothing not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several and that is all that i can recollect of it but it is very clever all the way through but i think my dear you said you had got it
p00217_B,00217,B,yes papa it is written out in our second page we copied it from the elegant extracts it was garrick s you know
p00218_B,00218,B,aye very true i wish i could recollect more of it the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama i hope we shall have her here next week have you thought my dear where you shall put her and what room there will be for the children
p00219_B,00219,B,oh yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know why should there be any change
p00220_B,00220,B,i do not know my dear but it is so long since she was here not since last easter and then only for a few days mr john knightley s being a lawyer is very inconvenient poor isabella she is sadly taken away from us all and how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here
p00221_B,00221,B,she will not be surprized papa at least
p00222_B,00222,B,i do not know my dear i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married
p00223_B,00223,B,we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here
p00224_B,00224,B,yes my dear if there is time but she is coming for only one week there will not be time for any thing
p00225_B,00225,B,it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmas though you know it is longer since they were with him than with us
p00226_B,00226,B,it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us she and the children might stay very well
p00227_B,00227,B,ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john
p00228_B,00228,B,aye i wonder which she will poor little dears how glad they will be to come they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet
p00229_B,00229,B,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00230_B,00230,B,henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father john the second is named after his father some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her and he is a very clever boy indeed they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways they will come and stand by my chair and say and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas i think their father is too rough with them very often
p00231_B,00231,B,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him
p00232_B,00232,B,and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way
p00233_B,00233,B,but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other
p00234_B,00234,B,well i cannot understand it
p00235_B,00235,B,that is the case with us all papa one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other
p00236_B,00236,B,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life
p00237_B,00237,B,there it is there go you and your riddle book one of these days
p00238_B,00238,B,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much
p00239_B,00239,B,i do not often walk this way now but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury i wish we could contrive it but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in no servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeper no message from my father
p00240_B,00240,B,i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married so charming as you are
p00241_B,00241,B,my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charming one other person at least and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all
p00242_B,00242,B,ah so you say but i cannot believe it
p00243_B,00243,B,i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person i would rather not be tempted i cannot really change for the better if i were to marry i must expect to repent it
p00244_B,00244,B,dear me it is so odd to hear a woman talk so
p00245_B,00245,B,i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s
p00246_B,00246,B,but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates
p00247_B,00247,B,that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried
p00248_B,00248,B,but still you will be an old maid and that s so dreadful
p00249_B,00249,B,never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm
p00250_B,00250,B,dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old
p00251_B,00251,B,if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpet work and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me
p00252_B,00252,B,do you know miss bates s niece that is i know you must have seen her a hundred times but are you acquainted
p00253_B,00253,B,oh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece heaven forbid at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death these are the sights harriet to do one good how trifling they make every thing else appear i feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind
p00254_B,00254,B,very true poor creatures one can think of nothing else
p00255_B,00255,B,and really i do not think the impression will soon be over i do not think it will
p00256_B,00256,B,oh dear no
p00257_B,00257,B,ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves
p00258_B,00258,B,oh dear yes
p00259_B,00259,B,to fall in with each other on such an errand as this to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration it must if i were not here i wish i were anywhere else this would soon have led to something better of course any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart if i could but have kept longer away
p00260_B,00260,B,oh yes sir how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir
p00261_B,00261,B,pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably
p00262_B,00262,B,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00263_B,00263,B,very much to the honour of both
p00264_B,00264,B,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00265_B,00265,B,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00266_B,00266,B,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00267_B,00267,B,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00268_B,00268,B,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00269_B,00269,B,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00270_B,00270,B,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can
p00271_B,00271,B,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00272_B,00272,B,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not
p00273_B,00273,B,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately
p00274_B,00274,B,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps
p00275_B,00275,B,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes
p00276_B,00276,B,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly
p00277_B,00277,B,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00278_B,00278,B,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords
p00279_B,00279,B,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree
p00280_B,00280,B,if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike
p00281_B,00281,B,to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong
p00282_B,00282,B,yes and reason good i was sixteen years old when you were born
p00283_B,00283,B,a material difference then and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of one and twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer
p00284_B,00284,B,yes a good deal nearer
p00285_B,00285,B,but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently
p00286_B,00286,B,i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now
p00287_B,00287,B,that s true very true little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed
p00288_B,00288,B,a man cannot be more so
p00289_B,00289,B,ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me
p00290_B,00290,B,john how are you
p00291_B,00291,B,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing
p00292_B,00292,B,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once
p00293_B,00293,B,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00294_B,00294,B,oh good mr perry how is he sir
p00295_B,00295,B,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where
p00296_B,00296,B,and mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow i have a great regard for mr perry i hope he will be calling soon he will be so pleased to see my little ones
p00297_B,00297,B,i hope he will be here to morrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bella s throat
p00298_B,00298,B,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august
p00299_B,00299,B,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to
p00300_B,00300,B,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00301_B,00301,B,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir
p00302_B,00302,B,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago
p00303_B,00303,B,how sorry i am but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy except when it has been quite an influenza
p00304_B,00304,B,that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november perry does not call it altogether a sickly season
p00305_B,00305,B,no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except
p00306_B,00306,B,ah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season nobody is healthy in london nobody can be it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off and the air so bad
p00307_B,00307,B,no indeed we are not at all in a bad air our part of london is very superior to most others you must not confound us with london in general my dear sir the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest we are so very airy i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town there is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airy mr wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air
p00308_B,00308,B,ah my dear it is not like hartfield you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present
p00309_B,00309,B,i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous head aches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming i hope you will think better of their looks to morrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill
p00310_B,00310,B,middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well
p00311_B,00311,B,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00312_B,00312,B,my dear isabella pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse
p00313_B,00313,B,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00314_B,00314,B,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma
p00315_B,00315,B,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet
p00316_B,00316,B,i am most happy to hear it but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior and exactly emma s age
p00317_B,00317,B,ah i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here
p00318_B,00318,B,but why should you be sorry sir i assure you it did the children a great deal of good
p00319_B,00319,B,and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end south end is an unhealthy place perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end
p00320_B,00320,B,i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sir we all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly
p00321_B,00321,B,you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the sea bathing places a fine open sea he says and very pure air and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable you should have consulted perry
p00322_B,00322,B,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty
p00323_B,00323,B,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure
p00324_B,00324,B,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself
p00325_B,00325,B,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion
p00326_B,00326,B,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night
p00327_B,00327,B,very cold certainly very cold
p00328_B,00328,B,you do quite right we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston
p00329_B,00329,B,mr elton s manners are not perfect but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority there is such perfect good temper and good will in mr elton as one cannot but value
p00330_B,00330,B,yes he seems to have a great deal of good will towards you
p00331_B,00331,B,me are you imagining me to be mr elton s object
p00332_B,00332,B,such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now
p00333_B,00333,B,mr elton in love with me what an idea
p00334_B,00334,B,i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do
p00335_B,00335,B,i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more
p00336_B,00336,B,a man must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing it is the greatest absurdity actually snowing at this moment the folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people s not staying comfortably at home when they can if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem it and here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man s house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home
p00337_B,00337,B,my report from mrs goddard s was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was my answer
p00338_B,00338,B,oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning
p00339_B,00339,B,my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard
p00340_B,00340,B,yes i imagined that is i did not
p00341_B,00341,B,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day
p00342_B,00342,B,dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment what an excellent device the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha snows a little i see
p00343_B,00343,B,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it
p00344_B,00344,B,christmas weather quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this day s party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather i was snowed up at a friend s house once for a week nothing could be pleasanter i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day se nnight
p00345_B,00345,B,i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls
p00346_B,00346,B,we are sure of excellent fires and every thing in the greatest comfort charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any mr weston s dining room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you will agree with me i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings
p00347_B,00347,B,i know nothing of the large parties of london sir i never dine with any body
p00348_B,00348,B,indeed i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment
p00349_B,00349,B,my first enjoyment will be to find myself safe at hartfield again
p00350_B,00350,B,can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable
p00351_B,00351,B,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself
p00352_B,00352,B,yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do the case you see is but this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room there are secrets in all families you know the case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that frank s coming depends upon their being put off if they are not put off he cannot stir but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point i have not the smallest doubt of the issue i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing
p00353_B,00353,B,i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case but am disposed to side with you mr weston if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe
p00354_B,00354,B,yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper
p00355_B,00355,B,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00356_B,00356,B,my emma what is the certainty of caprice
p00357_B,00357,B,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them
p00358_B,00358,B,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better
p00359_B,00359,B,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine
p00360_B,00360,B,he ought to come if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it
p00361_B,00361,B,one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her
p00362_B,00362,B,but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all
p00363_B,00363,B,my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be
p00364_B,00364,B,i shall not be satisfied unless he comes
p00365_B,00365,B,he may have a great deal of influence on some points and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us
p00366_B,00366,B,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00367_B,00367,B,you had better order the carriage directly my love i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold
p00368_B,00368,B,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses
p00369_B,00369,B,i am ready if the others are
p00370_B,00370,B,shall i ring the bell
p00371_B,00371,B,yes do
p00372_B,00372,B,miss smith message to miss smith what could she possibly mean
p00373_B,00373,B,mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it it is impossible for me to doubt any longer you have made yourself too clear mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smith such attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions
p00374_B,00374,B,good heaven what can be the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorry extremely sorry but miss smith indeed oh miss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character i have thought only of you i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself you cannot really seriously doubt it no i am sure you have seen and understood me charming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have long understood me
p00375_B,00375,B,no sir it confesses no such thing so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend harriet your pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smith that you have never thought seriously of her
p00376_B,00376,B,never madam never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received
p00377_B,00377,B,encouragement i give you encouragement sir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting i have no thoughts of matrimony at present
p00378_B,00378,B,the churchills are very likely in fault but i dare say he might come if he would
p00379_B,00379,B,i do not know why you should say so he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him
p00380_B,00380,B,i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof
p00381_B,00381,B,how odd you are what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature
p00382_B,00382,B,i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january a man at his age what is he three or four and twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that it is impossible
p00383_B,00383,B,that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage
p00384_B,00384,B,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills
p00385_B,00385,B,yes sometimes he can
p00386_B,00386,B,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure
p00387_B,00387,B,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others
p00388_B,00388,B,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going
p00389_B,00389,B,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable
p00390_B,00390,B,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his
p00391_B,00391,B,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it
p00392_B,00392,B,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction
p00393_B,00393,B,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life
p00394_B,00394,B,our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now
p00395_B,00395,B,we shall never agree about him but that is nothing extraordinary i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of man s perfection i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others
p00396_B,00396,B,yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father s having any right to complain his letters disgust me
p00397_B,00397,B,your feelings are singular they seem to satisfy every body else
p00398_B,00398,B,i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mother s place but without a mother s affection to blind her it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him
p00399_B,00399,B,you seem determined to think ill of him
p00400_B,00400,B,me not at all i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners
p00401_B,00401,B,well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else
p00402_B,00402,B,you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts
p00403_B,00403,B,my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him
p00404_B,00404,B,and mine is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing what at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point
p00405_B,00405,B,i will say no more about him you turn every thing to evil we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here
p00406_B,00406,B,prejudiced i am not prejudiced
p00407_B,00407,B,but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour
p00408_B,00408,B,he is a person i never think of from one month s end to another
p00409_B,00409,B,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00410_B,00410,B,thank you you are so kind oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here you are extremely kind you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting
p00411_B,00411,B,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon
p00412_B,00412,B,oh yes next week
p00413_B,00413,B,indeed that must be a very great pleasure
p00414_B,00414,B,thank you you are very kind yes next week every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days so very good of them to send her the whole way but they always do you know oh yes friday or saturday next that is what she writes about that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday
p00415_B,00415,B,yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax to day
p00416_B,00416,B,so obliging of you no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so delighted for she is to be three months with us at least three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them again for till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother or her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in jane s letter wrote in mr dixon s name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat baly craig a beautiful place i fancy jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean i do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses and as jane used to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself he is a most amiable charming young man i believe jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things
p00417_B,00417,B,you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell
p00418_B,00418,B,very true very true indeed the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen but you see every thing turns out for the best they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention he is a most charming young man ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon
p00419_B,00419,B,but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates
p00420_B,00420,B,yes entirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately
p00421_B,00421,B,i am concerned to hear of it i think they judge wisely but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax
p00422_B,00422,B,oh no you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not there is no comparison between them miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable
p00423_B,00423,B,yes that of course
p00424_B,00424,B,jane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us just like her so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we should do
p00425_B,00425,B,it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world
p00426_B,00426,B,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her
p00427_B,00427,B,i am afraid we must be running away my father will be expecting us i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning
p00428_B,00428,B,a very pleasant evening particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence
p00429_B,00429,B,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield
p00430_B,00430,B,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00431_B,00431,B,no you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore
p00432_B,00432,B,miss fairfax is reserved
p00433_B,00433,B,i always told you she was a little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence what arises from discretion must be honoured
p00434_B,00434,B,you think her diffident i do not see it
p00435_B,00435,B,my dear emma you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening
p00436_B,00436,B,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained
p00437_B,00437,B,i am disappointed
p00438_B,00438,B,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00439_B,00439,B,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax
p00440_B,00440,B,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart
p00441_B,00441,B,it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear
p00442_B,00442,B,my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like
p00443_B,00443,B,that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome
p00444_B,00444,B,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you
p00445_B,00445,B,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls
p00446_B,00446,B,no not at randalls i have not been near randalls
p00447_B,00447,B,there is my news i thought it would interest you
p00448_B,00448,B,but where could you hear it where could you possibly hear it mr knightley for it is not five minutes since i received mrs cole s note no it cannot be more than five or at least ten for i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come out i was only gone down to speak to patty again about the pork jane was standing in the passage were not you jane for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting pan large enough so i said i would go down and see and jane said said i well and just then came the note a miss hawkins that s all i know a miss hawkins of bath but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me a miss hawkins
p00449_B,00449,B,i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly
p00450_B,00450,B,well that is quite i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her
p00451_B,00451,B,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00452_B,00452,B,oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well
p00453_B,00453,B,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00454_B,00454,B,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00455_B,00455,B,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00456_B,00456,B,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00457_B,00457,B,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00458_B,00458,B,who shall answer that question my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind
p00459_B,00459,B,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00460_B,00460,B,as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins
p00461_B,00461,B,when i have seen mr elton i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off
p00462_B,00462,B,yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative
p00463_B,00463,B,quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all
p00464_B,00464,B,very odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand one takes up a notion and runs away with it mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome
p00465_B,00465,B,handsome oh no far from it certainly plain i told you he was plain
p00466_B,00466,B,my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself
p00467_B,00467,B,oh as for me my judgment is worth nothing where i have a regard i always think a person well looking but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain
p00468_B,00468,B,well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you
p00469_B,00469,B,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it
p00470_B,00470,B,very true would not think about it
p00471_B,00471,B,this is too bad and now we shall just miss them too provoking i do not know when i have been so disappointed
p00472_B,00472,B,we had better move on mr weston we are detaining the girls
p00473_B,00473,B,well well i am ready but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary
p00474_B,00474,B,think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock
p00475_B,00475,B,four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three
p00476_B,00476,B,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford
p00477_B,00477,B,my dear dear anxious friend always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon
p00478_B,00478,B,it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing
p00479_B,00479,B,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00480_B,00480,B,i hope i should know better no depend upon it that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms
p00481_B,00481,B,to be sure we do mrs bates we passed her house i saw miss bates at the window true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is call upon her by all means
p00482_B,00482,B,there is no necessity for my calling this morning another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which
p00483_B,00483,B,oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight
p00484_B,00484,B,i have heard her speak of the acquaintance she is a very elegant young woman
p00485_B,00485,B,you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way
p00486_B,00486,B,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00487_B,00487,B,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street
p00488_B,00488,B,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00489_B,00489,B,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before
p00490_B,00490,B,and how did you think miss fairfax looking
p00491_B,00491,B,ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion
p00492_B,00492,B,it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face well there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion
p00493_B,00493,B,i cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion
p00494_B,00494,B,did you see her often at weymouth were you often in the same society
p00495_B,00495,B,ha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at ford s if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury i must buy something at ford s it will be taking out my freedom i dare say they sell gloves
p00496_B,00496,B,oh yes gloves and every thing i do admire your patriotism you will be adored in highbury you were very popular before you came because you were mr weston s son but lay out half a guinea at ford s and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues
p00497_B,00497,B,but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life
p00498_B,00498,B,i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth
p00499_B,00499,B,and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance miss fairfax must already have given her account i shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow
p00500_B,00500,B,upon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her
p00501_B,00501,B,may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well i met her frequently at weymouth i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warm hearted woman i like them all
p00502_B,00502,B,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be
p00503_B,00503,B,yes i believe i do
p00504_B,00504,B,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00505_B,00505,B,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend
p00506_B,00506,B,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play
p00507_B,00507,B,ever hear her you forget how much she belongs to highbury i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began she plays charmingly
p00508_B,00508,B,you think so do you i wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof
p00509_B,00509,B,proof indeed mr dixon is very musical is he we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year
p00510_B,00510,B,yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof
p00511_B,00511,B,certainly very strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it
p00512_B,00512,B,it was her very particular friend you know
p00513_B,00513,B,poor comfort one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland
p00514_B,00514,B,you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it
p00515_B,00515,B,so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her quickness of friendship or dulness of feeling there was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction
p00516_B,00516,B,as to that i do not
p00517_B,00517,B,oh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfax s sensations from you or from any body else they are known to no human being i guess but herself but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses
p00518_B,00518,B,there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be
p00519_B,00519,B,i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends but we never did i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set and then her reserve i never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved
p00520_B,00520,B,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person
p00521_B,00521,B,not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question i have no reason to think ill of her not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal
p00522_B,00522,B,all young people would have their little whims all young people would have their little whims
p00523_B,00523,B,of course it must be declined
p00524_B,00524,B,i am not fond of dinner visiting i never was no more is emma late hours do not agree with us i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy ah miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me
p00525_B,00525,B,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00526_B,00526,B,you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course but you will do every thing right i need not tell you what is to be done we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday i shall have no fears for you with him we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour you will not like staying late you will get very tired when tea is over
p00527_B,00527,B,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00528_B,00528,B,oh no my love but you will soon be tired there will be a great many people talking at once you will not like the noise
p00529_B,00529,B,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party
p00530_B,00530,B,and no great harm if it does the sooner every party breaks up the better
p00531_B,00531,B,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years
p00532_B,00532,B,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends
p00533_B,00533,B,oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up
p00534_B,00534,B,how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment for if we had met first in the drawing room i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual you might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner
p00535_B,00535,B,yes i should i am sure i should there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances now you have nothing to try for you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed you are not striving to look taller than any body else now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you
p00536_B,00536,B,nonsensical girl
p00537_B,00537,B,why do you smile
p00538_B,00538,B,nay why do you
p00539_B,00539,B,me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present
p00540_B,00540,B,perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before
p00541_B,00541,B,or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body
p00542_B,00542,B,that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house
p00543_B,00543,B,you may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine
p00544_B,00544,B,i do not know i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question if colonel campbell is not the person who can be
p00545_B,00545,B,what do you say to mrs dixon
p00546_B,00546,B,mrs dixon very true indeed i had not thought of mrs dixon she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young woman s scheme than an elderly man s it is mrs dixon i dare say i told you that your suspicions would guide mine
p00547_B,00547,B,if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon in them
p00548_B,00548,B,mr dixon very well yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance
p00549_B,00549,B,yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained before i do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excuse in the summer it might have passed but what can any body s native air do for them in the months of january february and march good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are
p00550_B,00550,B,and upon my word they have an air of great probability mr dixon s preference of her music to her friend s i can answer for being very decided
p00551_B,00551,B,and then he saved her life did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard he caught her
p00552_B,00552,B,he did i was there one of the party
p00553_B,00553,B,were you really well but you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to you if i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries
p00554_B,00554,B,i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries
p00555_B,00555,B,the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon
p00556_B,00556,B,and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells
p00557_B,00557,B,no i am sure it is not from the campbells miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business
p00558_B,00558,B,indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love i have made a most wretched discovery i have been here a week to morrow half my time i never knew days fly so fast a week to morrow and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others i hate the recollection
p00559_B,00559,B,perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut
p00560_B,00560,B,no that is no subject of regret at all i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen
p00561_B,00561,B,what is the matter
p00562_B,00562,B,thank you for rousing me i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours
p00563_B,00563,B,how they were invited were not they
p00564_B,00564,B,oh yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming
p00565_B,00565,B,they walked i conclude how else could they come
p00566_B,00566,B,very true well a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold poor girl i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once good soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure nobody was ever so fortunate as herself but with many many thanks there was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprized very glad i am sure but really quite surprized such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention the sort of thing that so few men would think of and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them
p00567_B,00567,B,very likely nothing more likely i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good natured useful considerate or benevolent he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfax s ill health would appear a case of humanity to him and for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley i know he had horses to day for we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray
p00568_B,00568,B,well you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again the more i think of it the more probable it appears in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax see the consequence of keeping you company what do you say to it
p00569_B,00569,B,mr knightley and jane fairfax dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thing mr knightley mr knightley must not marry you would not have little henry cut out from donwell oh no no henry must have donwell i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely i am amazed that you should think of such a thing
p00570_B,00570,B,my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it i do not want the match i do not want to injure dear little henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henry s account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter
p00571_B,00571,B,yes i would i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now and jane fairfax too of all women
p00572_B,00572,B,nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know
p00573_B,00573,B,but the imprudence of such a match
p00574_B,00574,B,i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability
p00575_B,00575,B,i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention his good nature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention my dear mrs weston do not take to match making you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbey oh no no every feeling revolts for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing
p00576_B,00576,B,imprudent if you please but not mad excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable
p00577_B,00577,B,but mr knightley does not want to marry i am sure he has not the least idea of it do not put it into his head why should he marry he is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brother s children he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart
p00578_B,00578,B,my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax
p00579_B,00579,B,nonsense he does not care about jane fairfax in the way of love i am sure he does not he would do any good to her or her family but
p00580_B,00580,B,well perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home
p00581_B,00581,B,if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him to have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane so very kind and obliging but he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mother s old petticoat not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong
p00582_B,00582,B,for shame emma do not mimic her you divert me against my conscience and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates little things do not irritate him she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should have no happier prospect i have heard him express himself so warmly on those points such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley i cannot help suspecting him i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love
p00583_B,00583,B,then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do mr knightley does nothing mysteriously
p00584_B,00584,B,i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him
p00585_B,00585,B,very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so
p00586_B,00586,B,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner
p00587_B,00587,B,you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing i see no sign of attachment i believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax
p00588_B,00588,B,quite out of the question quite out of the question but you must often wish it i am sure
p00589_B,00589,B,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given
p00590_B,00590,B,yes but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell
p00591_B,00591,B,i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second
p00592_B,00592,B,that fellow thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be
p00593_B,00593,B,don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine
p00594_B,00594,B,oh dear i think you play the best of the two i think you play quite as well as she does i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played
p00595_B,00595,B,those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfax s is much beyond it
p00596_B,00596,B,well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution
p00597_B,00597,B,ah but jane fairfax has them both harriet
p00598_B,00598,B,are you sure i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste nobody talked about it and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think the coxes looked
p00599_B,00599,B,just as they always do very vulgar
p00600_B,00600,B,they told me something but it is nothing of any consequence they told me that mr martin dined with them last saturday
p00601_B,00601,B,she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be
p00602_B,00602,B,she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there he sat by her at dinner miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him
p00603_B,00603,B,very likely i think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury
p00604_B,00604,B,and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope to join your party and wait for her at hartfield if you are going home
p00605_B,00605,B,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased
p00606_B,00606,B,me i should be quite in the way but perhaps i may be equally in the way here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same what am i to do
p00607_B,00607,B,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument
p00608_B,00608,B,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood
p00609_B,00609,B,i do not believe any such thing i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfax s opinion last night
p00610_B,00610,B,do come with me if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it
p00611_B,00611,B,yes no yes to mrs goddard s only my pattern gown is at hartfield no you shall send it to hartfield if you please but then mrs goddard will want to see it and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you
p00612_B,00612,B,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00613_B,00613,B,no more it is
p00614_B,00614,B,no trouble in the world ma am
p00615_B,00615,B,oh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddard s i do not know no i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night what do you advise
p00616_B,00616,B,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford
p00617_B,00617,B,aye that will be much best i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s
p00618_B,00618,B,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00619_B,00619,B,very well i am much obliged to you my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night how is mr woodhouse i am so glad to hear such a good account mrs weston told me you were here said i said mr frank churchill said i said he for would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mother s spectacles the rivet came out you know this morning so very obliging for my mother had no use of her spectacles could not put them on and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed jane said so i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping said i then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises always i have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know only three of us besides dear jane at present and she really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it i dare not let my mother know how little she eats so i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street not that i had any doubt before i have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome we have apple dumplings however very often patty makes an excellent apple dumpling well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us
p00620_B,00620,B,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00621_B,00621,B,i have not been working uninterruptedly i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home whoever colonel campbell might employ the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so
p00622_B,00622,B,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her
p00623_B,00623,B,how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instrument s coming to hand do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences
p00624_B,00624,B,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture
p00625_B,00625,B,conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at all your real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word miss fairfax said something about conjecturing there it is done i have the pleasure madam of restoring your spectacles healed for the present if you are very kind it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night let me live them over again you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds all the worlds one ever has to give for another half hour what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth here is something quite new to me do you know it cramer and here are a new set of irish melodies that from such a quarter one might expect this was all sent with the instrument very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not it he knew miss fairfax could have no music here i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart nothing hastily done nothing incomplete true affection only could have prompted it
p00626_B,00626,B,you speak too plain she must understand you
p00627_B,00627,B,i hope she does i would have her understand me i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning
p00628_B,00628,B,but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea
p00629_B,00629,B,i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways leave shame to her if she does wrong she ought to feel it
p00630_B,00630,B,she is not entirely without it i think
p00631_B,00631,B,i do not see much sign of it she is playing robin adair at this moment his favourite
p00632_B,00632,B,how is your niece miss bates i want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece how is miss fairfax i hope she caught no cold last night how is she to day tell me how miss fairfax is
p00633_B,00633,B,so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage
p00634_B,00634,B,i am going to kingston can i do any thing for you
p00635_B,00635,B,oh dear kingston are you mrs cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston
p00636_B,00636,B,mrs cole has servants to send can i do any thing for you
p00637_B,00637,B,no i thank you but do come in who do you think is here miss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte do put up your horse at the crown and come in
p00638_B,00638,B,well for five minutes perhaps
p00639_B,00639,B,and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill too quite delightful so many friends
p00640_B,00640,B,no not now i thank you i could not stay two minutes i must get on to kingston as fast as i can
p00641_B,00641,B,oh do come in they will be so very happy to see you
p00642_B,00642,B,no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte
p00643_B,00643,B,well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasant did you ever see such dancing was not it delightful miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it
p00644_B,00644,B,oh very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes and i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best country dance player without exception in england now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it
p00645_B,00645,B,oh mr knightley one moment more something of consequence so shocked jane and i are both so shocked about the apples
p00646_B,00646,B,what is the matter now
p00647_B,00647,B,to think of your sending us all your store apples you said you had a great many and now you have not one left we really are so shocked mrs hodges may well be angry william larkins mentioned it here you should not have done it indeed you should not ah he is off he never can bear to be thanked but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well
p00648_B,00648,B,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing
p00649_B,00649,B,oh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud you must have heard every thing to be sure said he so i just mentioned oh miss woodhouse must you be going you seem but just come so very obliging of you
p00650_B,00650,B,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00651_B,00651,B,oh no it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man
p00652_B,00652,B,it would be a crowd a sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in
p00653_B,00653,B,very true it was very bad i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple
p00654_B,00654,B,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room
p00655_B,00655,B,there is no denying it i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well
p00656_B,00656,B,the crown
p00657_B,00657,B,yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls it is his own idea mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied this is what we all feel oh you were perfectly right ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield is not it a good exchange you consent i hope you consent
p00658_B,00658,B,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement
p00659_B,00659,B,i was going to observe sir that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body s catching cold so much less danger at the crown than at randalls mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could
p00660_B,00660,B,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house
p00661_B,00661,B,from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief
p00662_B,00662,B,open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it
p00663_B,00663,B,ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself
p00664_B,00664,B,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done
p00665_B,00665,B,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited
p00666_B,00666,B,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00667_B,00667,B,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00668_B,00668,B,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00669_B,00669,B,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00670_B,00670,B,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry
p00671_B,00671,B,my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you
p00672_B,00672,B,my dear you are too particular what does all that signify you will see nothing of it by candlelight it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of it on our club nights
p00673_B,00673,B,i do not think it is so very small we shall not be many you know
p00674_B,00674,B,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs
p00675_B,00675,B,i wish one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be
p00676_B,00676,B,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00677_B,00677,B,well if you please if you think she will be of any use
p00678_B,00678,B,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates
p00679_B,00679,B,but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know
p00680_B,00680,B,both sir can the old lady
p00681_B,00681,B,the old lady no the young lady to be sure i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece
p00682_B,00682,B,oh i beg your pardon sir i did not immediately recollect undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both
p00683_B,00683,B,he has asked her my dear that s right i knew he would
p00684_B,00684,B,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls
p00685_B,00685,B,ah the uncertainty of when i may be able to return i shall try for it with a zeal it will be the object of all my thoughts and cares and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid it is a custom gone for ever
p00686_B,00686,B,our poor ball must be quite given up
p00687_B,00687,B,ah that ball why did we wait for any thing why not seize the pleasure at once how often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation you told us it would be so oh miss woodhouse why are you always so right
p00688_B,00688,B,indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance i would much rather have been merry than wise
p00689_B,00689,B,if i can come again we are still to have our ball my father depends on it do not forget your engagement such a fortnight as it has been every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place happy those who can remain at highbury
p00690_B,00690,B,as you do us such ample justice now i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first do not we rather surpass your expectations i am sure we do i am sure you did not much expect to like us you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury and you must be off this very morning
p00691_B,00691,B,yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him
p00692_B,00692,B,not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates how unlucky miss bates s powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours
p00693_B,00693,B,yes i have called there passing the door i thought it better it was a right thing to do i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss bates s being absent she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight it was better to pay my visit then in short perhaps miss woodhouse i think you can hardly be quite without suspicion
p00694_B,00694,B,you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then
p00695_B,00695,B,it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield my regard for hartfield is most warm
p00696_B,00696,B,i shall hear about you all that is my chief consolation i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me she has been so kind as to promise it oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absent she will tell me every thing in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again
p00697_B,00697,B,i certainly must this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes
p00698_B,00698,B,i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice in not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness so much the better i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do i am quite enough in love i should be sorry to be more he is undoubtedly very much in love every thing denotes it very much in love indeed and when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage it it would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been different still however i must be on my guard this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily i must not dwell upon it i must not think of it i know the danger of indulging such speculations but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure
p00699_B,00699,B,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been
p00700_B,00700,B,there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet
p00701_B,00701,B,oh yes very a very pleasing young woman
p00702_B,00702,B,i think her beautiful quite beautiful
p00703_B,00703,B,very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown
p00704_B,00704,B,i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love
p00705_B,00705,B,oh no there is nothing to surprize one at all a pretty fortune and she came in his way
p00706_B,00706,B,i dare say i dare say she was very much attached to him
p00707_B,00707,B,perhaps she might but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have
p00708_B,00708,B,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful
p00709_B,00709,B,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties
p00710_B,00710,B,oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england
p00711_B,00711,B,yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry
p00712_B,00712,B,no i fancy not i never heard any county but surry called so my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer
p00713_B,00713,B,no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure
p00714_B,00714,B,ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good
p00715_B,00715,B,my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now
p00716_B,00716,B,ah that s a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give in my bath life i have seen such instances of it and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with
p00717_B,00717,B,i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer
p00718_B,00718,B,oh no indeed i must protest against any such idea a superior performer very far from it i assure you consider from how partial a quarter your information came i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into i absolutely cannot do without music it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give up parties balls plays for i had no fear of retirement blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me i could do very well without it to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments said i
p00719_B,00719,B,we cannot suppose that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive
p00720_B,00720,B,no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head i am delighted to find myself in such a circle i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours will not it be a good plan if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know there is a sad story against them in general they are but too apt to give up music
p00721_B,00721,B,but you who are so extremely fond of it there can be no danger surely
p00722_B,00722,B,i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble selina has entirely given up music never touches the instrument though she played sweetly and the same may be said of mrs jeffereys clara partridge that was and of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper
p00723_B,00723,B,but every thing of that kind will soon be in so regular a train
p00724_B,00724,B,well we shall see we have been calling at randalls and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and she appears so truly good there is something so motherly and kind hearted about her that it wins upon one directly she was your governess i think having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like but she is really quite the gentlewoman
p00725_B,00725,B,mrs weston s manners were always particularly good their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman
p00726_B,00726,B,and who do you think came in while we were there knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man
p00727_B,00727,B,insufferable woman worse than i had supposed absolutely insufferable knightley i could not have believed it knightley never seen him in her life before and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady i could not have believed it and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club one would fancy we were bosom friends and mrs weston astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my hopes harriet is disgraced by any comparison oh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here how angry and how diverted he would be ah there i am thinking of him directly always the first person to be thought of how i catch myself out frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind
p00728_B,00728,B,i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you
p00729_B,00729,B,yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient
p00730_B,00730,B,but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them
p00731_B,00731,B,no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may
p00732_B,00732,B,well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies
p00733_B,00733,B,my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry
p00734_B,00734,B,very pleasant and very elegantly dressed
p00735_B,00735,B,i cannot think there is any danger of it and when you are better acquainted with miss fairfax s situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown
p00736_B,00736,B,oh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown away whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end and i think she feels it i am sure she does she is very timid and silent one can see that she feels the want of encouragement i like her the better for it i must confess it is a recommendation to me i am a great advocate for timidity and i am sure one does not often meet with it but in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing oh i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express
p00737_B,00737,B,you appear to feel a great deal but i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfax s acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than
p00738_B,00738,B,my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act you and i need not be afraid if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it i have no idea of that sort of thing it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in income however my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax i shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche landau in some of our exploring parties
p00739_B,00739,B,she is a riddle quite a riddle to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and now to chuse the mortification of mrs elton s notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhere she is not to be with the dixons the decree is issued by somebody but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a separate puzzle
p00740_B,00740,B,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her
p00741_B,00741,B,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00742_B,00742,B,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00743_B,00743,B,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness
p00744_B,00744,B,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax
p00745_B,00745,B,yes any body may know how highly i think of her
p00746_B,00746,B,and yet and yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other
p00747_B,00747,B,oh are you there but you are miserably behindhand mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago that will never be however i can assure you miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask her and i am very sure i shall never ask her
p00748_B,00748,B,you are not vain mr knightley i will say that for you
p00749_B,00749,B,so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax
p00750_B,00750,B,no indeed i have not you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you what i said just now meant nothing one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning oh no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married
p00751_B,00751,B,no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize i never had a thought of her in that way i assure you jane fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even jane fairfax is perfect she has a fault she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife
p00752_B,00752,B,well and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose
p00753_B,00753,B,yes very soon he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours
p00754_B,00754,B,in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world i wonder how she speaks of the coles what she calls them how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity she calls you knightley what can she do for mr cole and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her mrs weston your argument weighs most with me i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax s mind over mrs elton i have no faith in mrs elton s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good breeding i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche landau
p00755_B,00755,B,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond
p00756_B,00756,B,well mrs weston what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax
p00757_B,00757,B,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me
p00758_B,00758,B,i went only to the post office and reached home before the rain was much it is my daily errand i always fetch the letters when i am here it saves trouble and is a something to get me out a walk before breakfast does me good
p00759_B,00759,B,not a walk in the rain i should imagine
p00760_B,00760,B,no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out
p00761_B,00761,B,that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for
p00762_B,00762,B,i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters
p00763_B,00763,B,indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse
p00764_B,00764,B,you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship
p00765_B,00765,B,i have often thought them the worst of the two business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does
p00766_B,00766,B,ah you are not serious now i know mr john knightley too well i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day
p00767_B,00767,B,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have
p00768_B,00768,B,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me
p00769_B,00769,B,my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for i hope your good grand mama and aunt are well they are some of my very old friends i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour you do us a great deal of honour to day i am sure my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield
p00770_B,00770,B,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again
p00771_B,00771,B,oh she shall not do such a thing again we will not allow her to do such a thing again there must be some arrangement made there must indeed i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation
p00772_B,00772,B,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before
p00773_B,00773,B,my dear jane say no more about it the thing is determined that is as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled
p00774_B,00774,B,excuse me i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmama s
p00775_B,00775,B,oh my dear but so much as patty has to do and it is a kindness to employ our men
p00776_B,00776,B,the post office is a wonderful establishment the regularity and despatch of it if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing
p00777_B,00777,B,it is certainly very well regulated
p00778_B,00778,B,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder
p00779_B,00779,B,the clerks grow expert from habit they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them if you want any farther explanation they are paid for it that is the key to a great deal of capacity the public pays and must be served well
p00780_B,00780,B,yes there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest
p00781_B,00781,B,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00782_B,00782,B,i never saw any gentleman s handwriting mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw
p00783_B,00783,B,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00784_B,00784,B,if we were in the other room if i had my writing desk i am sure i could produce a specimen i have a note of his do not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day
p00785_B,00785,B,he chose to say he was employed
p00786_B,00786,B,well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley
p00787_B,00787,B,oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best
p00788_B,00788,B,but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general
p00789_B,00789,B,but have you really heard of nothing
p00790_B,00790,B,i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet
p00791_B,00791,B,oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing
p00792_B,00792,B,i not aware dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done
p00793_B,00793,B,but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in
p00794_B,00794,B,colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present
p00795_B,00795,B,trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible
p00796_B,00796,B,thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble
p00797_B,00797,B,but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us your inexperience really amuses me a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moment s notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly
p00798_B,00798,B,excuse me ma am but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect
p00799_B,00799,B,oh my dear human flesh you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slave trade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition
p00800_B,00800,B,i did not mean i was not thinking of the slave trade governess trade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do
p00801_B,00801,B,something that would do aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourself i know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life
p00802_B,00802,B,you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for
p00803_B,00803,B,i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chose that is i do not know if you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as play yes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you chose and you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest
p00804_B,00804,B,you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am
p00805_B,00805,B,and i am quite serious too i assure you in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us here comes this dear old beau of mine i protest only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men what a dear creature he is i assure you i like him excessively i admire all that quaint old fashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner oh i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown how do you like it selina s choice handsome i think but i do not know whether it is not over trimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over trimmed quite a horror of finery i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dress show and finery are every thing i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin do you think it will look well
p00806_B,00806,B,oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage
p00807_B,00807,B,you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter
p00808_B,00808,B,and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you
p00809_B,00809,B,aye we men are sad fellows you must take care of yourself mrs elton this letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchill s account she has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her so they are all to move southward without loss of time
p00810_B,00810,B,indeed from yorkshire i think enscombe is in yorkshire
p00811_B,00811,B,yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey
p00812_B,00812,B,yes upon my word very considerable sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about you will hardly believe me but twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses
p00813_B,00813,B,the evil of the distance from enscombe is that mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together in frank s last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle s this you know speaks a great degree of weakness but now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the road so frank writes word certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton you must grant me that
p00814_B,00814,B,no indeed i shall grant you nothing i always take the part of my own sex i do indeed i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point i always stand up for women and i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchill s making incredible exertions to avoid it selina says it is quite horror to her and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution does mrs churchill do the same
p00815_B,00815,B,depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for
p00816_B,00816,B,oh mr weston do not mistake me selina is no fine lady i assure you do not run away with such an idea
p00817_B,00817,B,is not she then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld mrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchill s illness
p00818_B,00818,B,if she is really ill why not go to bath mr weston to bath or to clifton
p00819_B,00819,B,she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a retired place a fine place but very retired
p00820_B,00820,B,aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society
p00821_B,00821,B,frank was here in february for a fortnight
p00822_B,00822,B,so i remember to have heard he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world
p00823_B,00823,B,my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton when frank left us it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next
p00824_B,00824,B,very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymen s saffron robe would be put on for us oh the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair
p00825_B,00825,B,you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him
p00826_B,00826,B,and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer
p00827_B,00827,B,i hope i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart
p00828_B,00828,B,only think well that must be infinitely provoking i have quite a horror of upstarts maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston one has not great hopes from birmingham i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours it is infinitely too bad mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before him i believe at least i am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death
p00829_B,00829,B,i rather hope to satisfy you both for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic
p00830_B,00830,B,and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again
p00831_B,00831,B,that is very likely you think so do not you
p00832_B,00832,B,i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately
p00833_B,00833,B,difference no indeed i am not
p00834_B,00834,B,there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be witness this very time here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing like it your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr cole s or balls at the crown the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goings on is very great
p00835_B,00835,B,yes it is randalls that does it all
p00836_B,00836,B,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home
p00837_B,00837,B,no that need not be the consequence let them be sent to donwell i shall certainly be at leisure
p00838_B,00838,B,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts
p00839_B,00839,B,but miss bates and miss fairfax we thought you were to bring them
p00840_B,00840,B,i will see that there are umbrellas sir miss bates must not be forgotten
p00841_B,00841,B,a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better
p00842_B,00842,B,how do you like my gown how do you like my trimming how has wright done my hair nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior to others and i see very few pearls in the room except mine so frank churchill is a capital dancer i understand we shall see if our styles suit a fine young man certainly is frank churchill i like him very well
p00843_B,00843,B,how do you like mrs elton
p00844_B,00844,B,not at all
p00845_B,00845,B,you are ungrateful
p00846_B,00846,B,ungrateful what do you mean no do not tell me i do not want to know what you mean where is my father when are we to begin dancing
p00847_B,00847,B,do not you dance mr elton
p00848_B,00848,B,most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me
p00849_B,00849,B,me oh no i would get you a better partner than myself i am no dancer
p00850_B,00850,B,if mrs gilbert wishes to dance i shall have great pleasure i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert
p00851_B,00851,B,mrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing miss smith
p00852_B,00852,B,miss smith oh i had not observed you are extremely obliging and if i were not an old married man but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me any thing else i should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over
p00853_B,00853,B,they aimed at wounding more than harriet emma why is it that they are your enemies she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet
p00854_B,00854,B,i did and they cannot forgive me
p00855_B,00855,B,i shall not scold you i leave you to your own reflections
p00856_B,00856,B,can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong
p00857_B,00857,B,not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it
p00858_B,00858,B,i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet it was through a series of strange blunders
p00859_B,00859,B,and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected
p00860_B,00860,B,i am ready whenever i am wanted
p00861_B,00861,B,whom are you going to dance with
p00862_B,00862,B,with you if you will ask me
p00863_B,00863,B,will you
p00864_B,00864,B,indeed i will you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper
p00865_B,00865,B,brother and sister no indeed
p00866_B,00866,B,yes i hope i do
p00867_B,00867,B,how i could so long a time be fancying myself it seems like madness i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now i do not care whether i meet him or not except that of the two i had rather not see him and indeed i would go any distance round to avoid him but i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very ill tempered and disagreeable i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evil no let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moment s pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroy what i ought to have destroyed long ago what i ought never to have kept i know that very well however now i will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown cannot you guess what this parcel holds
p00868_B,00868,B,not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing
p00869_B,00869,B,no i cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much now you must recollect
p00870_B,00870,B,no indeed i do not
p00871_B,00871,B,dear me i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court plaister one of the very last times we ever met in it it was but a very few days before i had my sore throat just before mr and mrs john knightley came i think the very evening do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending court plaister but as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat
p00872_B,00872,B,my dearest harriet you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear remember it aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relic i knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger and my recommending court plaister and saying i had none about me oh my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well go on what else
p00873_B,00873,B,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally
p00874_B,00874,B,and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake
p00875_B,00875,B,i do remember it i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh yes mr knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr elton s seeming resolved to learn to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was standing just here was not he i have an idea he was standing just here
p00876_B,00876,B,ah i do not know i cannot recollect it is very odd but i cannot recollect mr elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now
p00877_B,00877,B,well go on
p00878_B,00878,B,oh that s all i have nothing more to shew you or to say except that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it
p00879_B,00879,B,my poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things
p00880_B,00880,B,yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married i knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them
p00881_B,00881,B,but harriet is it necessary to burn the court plaister i have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the court plaister might be useful
p00882_B,00882,B,i shall be happier to burn it it has a disagreeable look to me i must get rid of every thing there it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton
p00883_B,00883,B,and when will there be a beginning of mr churchill
p00884_B,00884,B,never marry this is a new resolution
p00885_B,00885,B,it is one that i shall never change however
p00886_B,00886,B,i hope it does not proceed from i hope it is not in compliment to mr elton
p00887_B,00887,B,mr elton indeed oh no so superior to mr elton
p00888_B,00888,B,harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you is not it so
p00889_B,00889,B,oh miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so mad but it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially
p00890_B,00890,B,i am not at all surprized at you harriet the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart
p00891_B,00891,B,service oh it was such an inexpressible obligation the very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time when i saw him coming his noble look and my wretchedness before such a change in one moment such a change from perfect misery to perfect happiness
p00892_B,00892,B,it is very natural it is natural and it is honourable yes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully but that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise i do not advise you to give way to it harriet i do not by any means engage for its being returned consider what you are about perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you be observant of him let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject i am determined against all interference henceforward i know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value
p00893_B,00893,B,i did not know that he ever had any such plan
p00894_B,00894,B,nay i had it from you you wrote me word of it three months ago
p00895_B,00895,B,me impossible
p00896_B,00896,B,indeed you did i remember it perfectly you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm you must remember it now
p00897_B,00897,B,upon my word i never heard of it till this moment
p00898_B,00898,B,never really never bless me how could it be then i must have dreamt it but i was completely persuaded miss smith you walk as if you were tired you will not be sorry to find yourself at home
p00899_B,00899,B,what is this what is this about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you
p00900_B,00900,B,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry
p00901_B,00901,B,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think
p00902_B,00902,B,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed
p00903_B,00903,B,miss woodhouse have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again
p00904_B,00904,B,nonsense for shame
p00905_B,00905,B,i will give it to her shall i
p00906_B,00906,B,no no you must not you shall not indeed
p00907_B,00907,B,aye very true my dear i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night
p00908_B,00908,B,pray emma may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other
p00909_B,00909,B,oh it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves
p00910_B,00910,B,the joke seemed confined to you and mr churchill my dear emma do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of
p00911_B,00911,B,between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax oh yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it
p00912_B,00912,B,have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him
p00913_B,00913,B,never never never for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me and how could it possibly come into your head
p00914_B,00914,B,i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public
p00915_B,00915,B,oh you amuse me excessively i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will not do there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explain there is a good deal of nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be that is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its being so on his i will answer for the gentleman s indifference
p00916_B,00916,B,you had better explore to donwell that may be done without horses come and eat my strawberries they are ripening fast
p00917_B,00917,B,oh i should like it of all things you may depend upon me i certainly will come name your day and i will come you will allow me to bring jane fairfax
p00918_B,00918,B,i cannot name a day till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you
p00919_B,00919,B,oh leave all that to me only give me a carte blanche i am lady patroness you know it is my party i will bring friends with me
p00920_B,00920,B,i hope you will bring elton but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations
p00921_B,00921,B,oh now you are looking very sly but consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to me i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely authorised it is my party leave it all to me i will invite your guests
p00922_B,00922,B,no there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is
p00923_B,00923,B,mrs weston i suppose
p00924_B,00924,B,no mrs knightley and till she is in being i will manage such matters myself
p00925_B,00925,B,ah you are an odd creature you are a humourist and may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don t scruple i know you are attached to them
p00926_B,00926,B,you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home
p00927_B,00927,B,that s quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea
p00928_B,00928,B,not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house
p00929_B,00929,B,well as you please only don t have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything
p00930_B,00930,B,i have not the least wish for it i thank you
p00931_B,00931,B,well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever
p00932_B,00932,B,i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any body s assistance
p00933_B,00933,B,i wish we had a donkey the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and me and my caro sposo walking by i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt
p00934_B,00934,B,you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible
p00935_B,00935,B,that i am sure you would indeed i do you justice my good friend under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist yes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme you have hit upon the very thing to please me
p00936_B,00936,B,will you be so kind when i am missed as to say that i am gone home i am going this moment my aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absent but i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directly i have said nothing about it to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone
p00937_B,00937,B,certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone
p00938_B,00938,B,yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at home in twenty minutes
p00939_B,00939,B,but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes
p00940_B,00940,B,thank you thank you but on no account i would rather walk and for me to be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have to guard others
p00941_B,00941,B,that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already
p00942_B,00942,B,i am i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone
p00943_B,00943,B,such a home indeed such an aunt i do pity you and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you
p00944_B,00944,B,as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met one as i came madness in such weather absolute madness
p00945_B,00945,B,i am glad i have done being in love with him i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning harriet s sweet easy temper will not mind it
p00946_B,00946,B,that may be but not by sketches in swisserland you will never go to swisserland your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england
p00947_B,00947,B,they may be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england and would leave it to morrow if i could
p00948_B,00948,B,you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay
p00949_B,00949,B,i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person
p00950_B,00950,B,you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us
p00951_B,00951,B,no i shall not stir i shall sit by you you are my best cure
p00952_B,00952,B,we are going to box hill to morrow you will join us it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change you will stay and go with us
p00953_B,00953,B,no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening
p00954_B,00954,B,but you may come again in the cool of to morrow morning
p00955_B,00955,B,no it will not be worth while if i come i shall be cross
p00956_B,00956,B,then pray stay at richmond
p00957_B,00957,B,but if i do i shall be crosser still i can never bear to think of you all there without me
p00958_B,00958,B,these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more
p00959_B,00959,B,well if you wish me to stay and join the party i will
p00960_B,00960,B,yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come
p00961_B,00961,B,don t say i was cross i was fatigued the heat overcame me
p00962_B,00962,B,it is hotter to day
p00963_B,00963,B,not to my feelings i am perfectly comfortable to day
p00964_B,00964,B,you are comfortable because you are under command
p00965_B,00965,B,your command yes
p00966_B,00966,B,perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but to day you are got back again and as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine
p00967_B,00967,B,it comes to the same thing i can have no self command without a motive you order me whether you speak or not and you can be always with me you are always with me
p00968_B,00968,B,dating from three o clock yesterday my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before
p00969_B,00969,B,three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february
p00970_B,00970,B,your gallantry is really unanswerable but
p00971_B,00971,B,i say nothing of which i am ashamed i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february
p00972_B,00972,B,is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of
p00973_B,00973,B,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00974_B,00974,B,it is a sort of thing which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party i never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women
p00975_B,00975,B,very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to you
p00976_B,00976,B,oh very well then i need not be uneasy that will just do for me you know i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shan t i do not you all think i shall
p00977_B,00977,B,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00978_B,00978,B,ah well to be sure yes i see what she means and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend
p00979_B,00979,B,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00980_B,00980,B,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00981_B,00981,B,no no it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it
p00982_B,00982,B,i doubt its being very clever myself it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection
p00983_B,00983,B,what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know
p00984_B,00984,B,ah you will never guess you i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand
p00985_B,00985,B,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00986_B,00986,B,oh for myself i protest i must be excused i really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us
p00987_B,00987,B,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00988_B,00988,B,with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm
p00989_B,00989,B,happy couple how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life
p00990_B,00990,B,such things do occur undoubtedly
p00991_B,00991,B,you were speaking
p00992_B,00992,B,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever
p00993_B,00993,B,well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me will you will you chuse a wife for me i am sure i should like any body fixed on by you you provide for the family you know find some body for me i am in no hurry adopt her educate her
p00994_B,00994,B,and make her like myself
p00995_B,00995,B,by all means if you can
p00996_B,00996,B,very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife
p00997_B,00997,B,she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember
p00998_B,00998,B,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p00999_B,00999,B,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p01000_B,01000,B,emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible
p01001_B,01001,B,nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me
p01002_B,01002,B,i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome
p01003_B,01003,B,oh i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her
p01004_B,01004,B,they are blended i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now
p01005_B,01005,B,where may i ask is miss fairfax going
p01006_B,01006,B,to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs suckling s own family and mrs bragge s but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhood lives only four miles from maple grove jane will be only four miles from maple grove
p01007_B,01007,B,mrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes
p01008_B,01008,B,yes our good mrs elton the most indefatigable true friend she would not take a denial she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbell s return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present and so she told mrs elton over and over again and i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mind but that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take jane s answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would wait and sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go quite a surprize to me i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled
p01009_B,01009,B,you spent the evening with mrs elton
p01010_B,01010,B,yes all of us mrs elton would have us come it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley said she
p01011_B,01011,B,mr knightley was there too was he
p01012_B,01012,B,no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did not but my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party even pleasure you know is fatiguing and i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it
p01013_B,01013,B,miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day
p01014_B,01014,B,i dare say she had
p01015_B,01015,B,whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends but i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible i mean as to the character and manners of the family
p01016_B,01016,B,thank you dear miss woodhouse yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs elton s acquaintance mrs smallridge a most delightful woman a style of living almost equal to maple grove and as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere jane will be treated with such regard and kindness it will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasure and her salary i really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane
p01017_B,01017,B,ah madam if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned
p01018_B,01018,B,you are so noble in your ideas
p01019_B,01019,B,and when is miss fairfax to leave you
p01020_B,01020,B,very soon very soon indeed that s the worst of it within a fortnight mrs smallridge is in a great hurry my poor mother does not know how to bear it so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come ma am do not let us think about it any more
p01021_B,01021,B,her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return
p01022_B,01022,B,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s
p01023_B,01023,B,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p01024_B,01024,B,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time
p01025_B,01025,B,well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them
p01026_B,01026,B,is she unwell
p01027_B,01027,B,no no not at all only a little agitated she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you know humph can you come
p01028_B,01028,B,certainly this moment if you please it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way but what can be the matter is she really not ill
p01029_B,01029,B,depend upon me but ask no more questions you will know it all in time the most unaccountable business but hush hush
p01030_B,01030,B,now now mr weston do let me know what has happened
p01031_B,01031,B,no no don t ask me i promised my wife to leave it all to her she will break it to you better than i can do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon
p01032_B,01032,B,break it to me good god mr weston tell me at once something has happened in brunswick square i know it has tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is
p01033_B,01033,B,no indeed you are mistaken
p01034_B,01034,B,mr weston do not trifle with me consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square which of them is it i charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment
p01035_B,01035,B,upon my word emma
p01036_B,01036,B,your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family
p01037_B,01037,B,upon my honour it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley i was wrong in talking of its being broke to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls
p01038_B,01038,B,who is that gentleman on horseback
p01039_B,01039,B,i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not frank i assure you you will not see him he is half way to windsor by this time
p01040_B,01040,B,has your son been with you then
p01041_B,01041,B,oh yes did not you know well well never mind yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did
p01042_B,01042,B,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear
p01043_B,01043,B,so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess
p01044_B,01044,B,you are right it does relate to him and i will tell you directly he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment more than an attachment indeed an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged nay that they have been long engaged
p01045_B,01045,B,jane fairfax good god you are not serious you do not mean it
p01046_B,01046,B,you may well be amazed you may well be amazed but it is even so there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the campbells nor her family nor his it is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him
p01047_B,01047,B,well this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury
p01048_B,01048,B,engaged since october secretly engaged it has hurt me emma very much it has hurt his father equally some part of his conduct we cannot excuse
p01049_B,01049,B,i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to him nay was attached and how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder fortunately however it did cease i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him you may believe me mrs weston this is the simple truth
p01050_B,01050,B,mr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself on this point we have been wretched it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account
p01051_B,01051,B,i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly did while he really belonged to another how could he tell what mischief he might be doing how could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him very wrong very wrong indeed
p01052_B,01052,B,from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine
p01053_B,01053,B,and how could she bear such behaviour composure with a witness to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent it that is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect
p01054_B,01054,B,there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly he had not time to enter into much explanation he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct
p01055_B,01055,B,impropriety oh mrs weston it is too calm a censure much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion so unlike what a man should be none of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life
p01056_B,01056,B,nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and
p01057_B,01057,B,good god mrs smallridge too jane actually on the point of going as governess what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy to suffer her to engage herself to suffer her even to think of such a measure
p01058_B,01058,B,he knew nothing about it emma on this article i can fully acquit him it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to him or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction till yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long i am to hear from him soon he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now let us wait therefore for this letter it may bring many extenuations it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood don t let us be severe don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him let us have patience i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment
p01059_B,01059,B,his sufferings do not appear to have done him much harm well and how did mr churchill take it
p01060_B,01060,B,most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty conceive what the events of a week have done in that family while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibility but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave he gave his consent with very little persuasion
p01061_B,01061,B,ah he would have done as much for harriet
p01062_B,01062,B,and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy the campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement
p01063_B,01063,B,none not one he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves
p01064_B,01064,B,well i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit espionage and treachery to come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us all here have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear they must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable
p01065_B,01065,B,i am quite easy on that head i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard
p01066_B,01066,B,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady
p01067_B,01067,B,true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe
p01068_B,01068,B,much indeed if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter
p01069_B,01069,B,what news do you mean
p01070_B,01070,B,about jane fairfax did you ever hear any thing so strange oh you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it
p01071_B,01071,B,what did mr weston tell you
p01072_B,01072,B,oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while how very odd had you any idea of his being in love with her you perhaps might you who can see into every body s heart but nobody else
p01073_B,01073,B,upon my word i begin to doubt my having any such talent can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly
p01074_B,01074,B,me why should you caution me you do not think i care about mr frank churchill
p01075_B,01075,B,i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him
p01076_B,01076,B,him never never dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me
p01077_B,01077,B,harriet what do you mean good heaven what do you mean mistake you am i to suppose then
p01078_B,01078,B,i should not have thought it possible that you could have misunderstood me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person mr frank churchill indeed i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side and that you should have been so mistaken is amazing i am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if you who had been always acquainted with him
p01079_B,01079,B,harriet let us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley
p01080_B,01080,B,to be sure i am i never could have an idea of any body else and so i thought you knew when we talked about him it was as clear as possible
p01081_B,01081,B,not quite for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of
p01082_B,01082,B,oh miss woodhouse how you do forget
p01083_B,01083,B,my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory
p01084_B,01084,B,oh dear now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time it was not the gipsies it was not mr frank churchill that i meant no i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth
p01085_B,01085,B,good god this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake what is to be done
p01086_B,01086,B,you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and now it is possible i do not wonder miss woodhouse that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other but i hope miss woodhouse that supposing that if strange as it may appear but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to if mr knightley should really if he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way but you are too good for that i am sure
p01087_B,01087,B,have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection
p01088_B,01088,B,yes i must say that i have
p01089_B,01089,B,might he not is not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin he might have mr martin s interest in view
p01090_B,01090,B,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful
p01091_B,01091,B,harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does
p01092_B,01092,B,poor girl she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement
p01093_B,01093,B,wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself said she she continued
p01094_B,01094,B,poor girl she loves him then excessively i suppose it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement her affection must have overpowered her judgment
p01095_B,01095,B,yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him
p01096_B,01096,B,i am afraid that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy
p01097_B,01097,B,on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear said she she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself
p01098_B,01098,B,if i did not know her to be happy now which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she is very good i hope she will be very happy it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers
p01099_B,01099,B,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come are you well my emma
p01100_B,01100,B,oh perfectly i am always well you know be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible
p01101_B,01101,B,have i of what nature
p01102_B,01102,B,oh the best nature in the world a wedding
p01103_B,01103,B,if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already
p01104_B,01104,B,how is it possible
p01105_B,01105,B,i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened
p01106_B,01106,B,you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicions i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution i wish i had attended to it but i seem to have been doomed to blindness
p01107_B,01107,B,time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself the feelings of the warmest friendship indignation abominable scoundrel he will soon be gone they will soon be in yorkshire i am sorry for her she deserves a better fate
p01108_B,01108,B,you are very kind but you are mistaken and i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier
p01109_B,01109,B,emma are you indeed no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled i could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felt i could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which i never believed him to deserve he is a disgrace to the name of man and is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman jane jane you will be a miserable creature
p01110_B,01110,B,mr knightley i am in a very extraordinary situation i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse but i never have i have very little to say for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding many circumstances assisted the temptation he was the son of mr weston he was continually here i always found him very pleasant and in short for let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions latterly however for some time indeed i have had no idea of their meaning any thing i thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side he has imposed on me but he has not injured me i have never been attached to him and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour he never wished to attach me it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him
p01111_B,01111,B,i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him my acquaintance with him has been but trifling and even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out well with such a woman he has a chance i have no motive for wishing him ill and for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well
p01112_B,01112,B,i have no doubt of their being happy together i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached
p01113_B,01113,B,he is a most fortunate man so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before him assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love for jane fairfax s character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favour equality of situation i mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but one and that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortals frank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune every thing turns out for his good he meets with a young woman at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superior his aunt is in the way his aunt dies he has only to speak his friends are eager to promote his happiness he had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him he is a fortunate man indeed
p01114_B,01114,B,you speak as if you envied him
p01115_B,01115,B,and i do envy him emma in one respect he is the object of my envy you will not ask me what is the point of envy you are determined i see to have no curiosity you are wise but i cannot be wise emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment
p01116_B,01116,B,oh then don t speak it don t speak it take a little time consider do not commit yourself
p01117_B,01117,B,thank you you are going in i suppose
p01118_B,01118,B,no i should like to take another turn mr perry is not gone i stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you pain but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend indeed you may command me i will hear whatever you like i will tell you exactly what i think
p01119_B,01119,B,as a friend emma that i fear is a word no i have no wish stay yes why should i hesitate i have gone too far already for concealment emma i accept your offer extraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friend tell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding my dearest emma for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hour s conversation my dearest most beloved emma tell me at once say no if it is to be said you are silent absolutely silent at present i ask no more i cannot make speeches emma if i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them god knows i have been a very indifferent lover but you understand me yes you see you understand my feelings and will return them if you can at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice i shall be very glad to look it over but it seems long i will take it home with me at night i would rather be talking to you but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference humph a fine complimentary opening but it is his way one man s style must not be the rule of another s we will not be severe it will be natural for me to speak my opinion aloud as i read by doing it i shall feel that i am near you it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it
p01120_B,01120,B,not at all i should wish it
p01121_B,01121,B,he trifles here as to the temptation he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urge bad he ought not to have formed the engagement he is unjust however to his father mr weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it very true he did not come till miss fairfax was here
p01122_B,01122,B,and i have not forgotten how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right
p01123_B,01123,B,i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think had you not been in the case i should still have distrusted him very bad though it might have been worse playing a most dangerous game too much indebted to the event for his acquittal no judge of his own manners by you always deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own convenience fancying you to have fathomed his secret natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other
p01124_B,01124,B,you had better go on
p01125_B,01125,B,the pianoforte ah that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure a boyish scheme indeed i cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could i perfectly agree with you sir you did behave very shamefully you never wrote a truer line this is very bad he had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily she must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons his feelings are natural what actually resolve to break with him entirely she felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it what a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour well he must be a most extraordinary
p01126_B,01126,B,nay nay read on you will find how very much he suffers
p01127_B,01127,B,i hope he does smallridge what does this mean what is all this
p01128_B,01128,B,she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridge s children a dear friend of mrs elton s a neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment
p01129_B,01129,B,say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to read not even of mrs elton only one page more i shall soon have done what a letter the man writes
p01130_B,01130,B,i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him
p01131_B,01131,B,well there is feeling here he does seem to have suffered in finding her ill certainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands come he knows himself there those were miss woodhouse s words were they and a fine ending and there is the letter the child of good fortune that was your name for him was it
p01132_B,01132,B,you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it i hope it does him some service with you
p01133_B,01133,B,yes certainly it does he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants and now let me talk to you of something else i have another person s interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject
p01134_B,01134,B,ah there is one difficulty unprovided for i am sure william larkins will not like it you must get his consent before you ask mine
p01135_B,01135,B,yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you
p01136_B,01136,B,what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged
p01137_B,01137,B,upon my word it is miss bates he really is engaged from morning to night there is no end of people s coming to him on some pretence or other the magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion they seem not able to do any thing without him i often say bad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree i believe i have not played a bar this fortnight however he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all
p01138_B,01138,B,is mr elton gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk
p01139_B,01139,B,oh no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who lead i fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way
p01140_B,01140,B,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday
p01141_B,01141,B,oh no the meeting is certainly to day i do believe this is the most troublesome parish that ever was we never heard of such things at maple grove
p01142_B,01142,B,your parish there was small
p01143_B,01143,B,upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of
p01144_B,01144,B,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children
p01145_B,01145,B,ah you clever creature that s very true what a thinking brain you have i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection not that i presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection already but hush not a word if you please
p01146_B,01146,B,when i got to donwell knightley could not be found very odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one
p01147_B,01147,B,donwell my dear mr e you have not been to donwell you mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown
p01148_B,01148,B,no no that s to morrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley to day on that very account such a dreadful broiling morning i went over the fields too which made it so much the worse and then not to find him at home i assure you i am not at all pleased and no apology left no message for me the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected very extraordinary and nobody knew at all which way he was gone perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods miss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightley can you explain it
p01149_B,01149,B,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it
p01150_B,01150,B,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose
p01151_B,01151,B,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent
p01152_B,01152,B,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend
p01153_B,01153,B,oh you are too scrupulous indeed you are you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even
p01154_B,01154,B,you are very kind but i know what my manners were to you so cold and artificial i had always a part to act it was a life of deceit i know that i must have disgusted you
p01155_B,01155,B,pray say no more i feel that all the apologies should be on my side let us forgive each other at once we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor
p01156_B,01156,B,oh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell
p01157_B,01157,B,nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps but excuse me it must be thought of
p01158_B,01158,B,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for
p01159_B,01159,B,thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of oh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open good bye good bye
p01160_B,01160,B,that is she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all it will be the only difference
p01161_B,01161,B,poor child at that rate what will become of her
p01162_B,01162,B,nothing very bad the fate of thousands she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them
p01163_B,01163,B,but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it
p01164_B,01164,B,do you i have no doubt nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles you must have done well my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me and i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least
p01165_B,01165,B,i am sure you were of use to me i was very often influenced rightly by you oftener than i would own at the time i am very sure you did me good and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen
p01166_B,01166,B,how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one
p01167_B,01167,B,what an amiable creature i was no wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance
p01168_B,01168,B,mr knightley you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal i want you to call me something else but i do not know what
p01169_B,01169,B,i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again
p01170_B,01170,B,and cannot you call me george now
p01171_B,01171,B,impossible i never can call you any thing but mr knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr k but i will promise i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not say when but perhaps you may guess where in the building in which n takes m for better for worse
p01172_B,01172,B,john does not even mention your friend here is his answer if you like to see it john enters like a brother into my happiness but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes
p01173_B,01173,B,he writes like a sensible man i honour his sincerity it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him
p01174_B,01174,B,my emma he means no such thing he only means
p01175_B,01175,B,he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject
p01176_B,01176,B,emma my dear emma
p01177_B,01177,B,oh if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther
p01178_B,01178,B,ah i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together i am amused by one part of john s letter did you notice it where he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind
p01179_B,01179,B,if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying he had no idea of me he seems perfectly unprepared for that
p01180_B,01180,B,yes yes but i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings what has he been judging by i am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another but it was so i suppose i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now
p01181_B,01181,B,poor knightley poor fellow sad business for him
p01182_B,01182,B,good or bad
p01183_B,01183,B,i do not know which it ought to be called
p01184_B,01184,B,oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile
p01185_B,01185,B,i am afraid i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it
p01186_B,01186,B,indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too
p01187_B,01187,B,there is one subject i hope but one on which we do not think alike does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith have you heard from her yourself this morning you have i believe and know the whole
p01188_B,01188,B,no i have not i know nothing pray tell me
p01189_B,01189,B,you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin it is so indeed i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject
p01190_B,01190,B,you mistake me you quite mistake me it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it it seems an impossibility you cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again yet you only mean that he intends it
p01191_B,01191,B,i mean that he has done it and been accepted
p01192_B,01192,B,good god well well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me how where when let me know it all i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible
p01193_B,01193,B,it is a very simple story he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to john he delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astley s they were going to take the two eldest boys to astley s the party was to be our brother and sister henry john and miss smith my friend robert could not resist they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vain she made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving he came down by yesterday s coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own this is all that i can relate of the how where and when your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her she will give you all the minute particulars which only woman s language can make interesting in our communications we deal only in the great however i must say that robert martin s heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astley s my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more his good sense and good principles would delight you as far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emma you laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin
p01194_B,01194,B,you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match i think harriet is doing extremely well her connexions may be worse than his in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before
p01195_B,01195,B,you ought to know your friend best but i should say she was a good tempered soft hearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her
p01196_B,01196,B,upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i do but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him i could suppose she might in time but can she already did not you misunderstand him you were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drills and might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake him it was not harriet s hand that he was certain of it was the dimensions of some famous ox
p01197_B,01197,B,do you dare say this do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of what do you deserve
p01198_B,01198,B,oh i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are
p01199_B,01199,B,i am quite sure that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard i assured him that i could not then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day
p01200_B,01200,B,i am perfectly satisfied and most sincerely wish them happy
p01201_B,01201,B,you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before
p01202_B,01202,B,i hope so for at that time i was a fool
p01203_B,01203,B,and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet s good qualities i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martin s sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her i have often talked to her a good deal you must have seen that i did sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for
p01204_B,01204,B,me ah poor harriet
p01205_B,01205,B,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person
p01206_B,01206,B,is not she looking well better than she ever used to do you see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her
p01207_B,01207,B,i can never think of it without extreme shame
p01208_B,01208,B,the shame is all mine or ought to be but is it possible that you had no suspicion i mean of late early i know you had none
p01209_B,01209,B,i never had the smallest i assure you
p01210_B,01210,B,that appears quite wonderful i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service it would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing
p01211_B,01211,B,it is not now worth a regret
p01212_B,01212,B,i have some hope of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northward but now i am at such a distance from her is not it hard miss woodhouse till this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation do not you pity me ah by the bye i hope mr knightley is well i know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise did you ever see such a skin such smoothness such delicacy and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eye lashes and hair a most distinguishing complexion so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty
p01213_B,01213,B,i have always admired her complexion but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale when we first began to talk of her have you quite forgotten
p01214_B,01214,B,oh no what an impudent dog i was how could i dare
p01215_B,01215,B,i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you
p01216_B,01216,B,oh no no no how can you suspect me of such a thing i was the most miserable wretch
p01217_B,01217,B,not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation i think there is a little likeness between us if not in our dispositions there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own
p01218_B,01218,B,true true no not true on your side you can have no superior but most true on mine she is a complete angel look at her is not she an angel in every gesture observe the turn of her throat observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels they are to be new set i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head will not it be beautiful in her dark hair
p01219_B,01219,B,very beautiful indeed
p01220_B,01220,B,how delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such excellent looks i would not have missed this meeting for the world i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come
p01221_B,01221,B,how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me they will sometimes obtrude but how you can court them
p01222_B,01222,B,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister
p01223_B,01223,B,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p01224_B,01224,B,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up
p01225_B,01225,B,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p01226_B,01226,B,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress
p01227_B,01227,B,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends
p01228_B,01228,B,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association
p01229_B,01229,B,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them
p01230_B,01230,B,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p01231_B,01231,B,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct
p01232_B,01232,B,this is not a very promising beginning after all that i said to her as we came along i thought she would have behaved better i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first i wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper her poor mother had a good deal but we must make allowances for such a child and i do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her for with all its faults it was her home and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better but then there is moderation in all things
p01233_B,01233,B,no no not at all no thank you william did not like she should come away he had told her he should miss her very much indeed
p01234_B,01234,B,but william will write to you i dare say
p01235_B,01235,B,yes he had promised he would but he had told her to write first
p01236_B,01236,B,and when shall you do it
p01237_B,01237,B,she did not know she had not any paper
p01238_B,01238,B,if that be all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you choose would it make you happy to write to william
p01239_B,01239,B,yes very
p01240_B,01240,B,then let it be done now come with me into the breakfast room we shall find everything there and be sure of having the room to ourselves
p01241_B,01241,B,but cousin will it go to the post
p01242_B,01242,B,yes depend upon me it shall it shall go with the other letters and as your uncle will frank it it will cost william nothing
p01243_B,01243,B,my uncle
p01244_B,01244,B,yes when you have written the letter i will take it to my father to frank
p01245_B,01245,B,my dear it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself
p01246_B,01246,B,very true indeed my dears but you are blessed with wonderful memories and your poor cousin has probably none at all there is a vast deal of difference in memories as well as in everything else and therefore you must make allowance for your cousin and pity her deficiency and remember that if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves you should always be modest for much as you know already there is a great deal more for you to learn
p01247_B,01247,B,to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference
p01248_B,01248,B,going to leave you
p01249_B,01249,B,yes my dear why should you be astonished you have been five years with us and my sister always meant to take you when mr norris died but you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same
p01250_B,01250,B,i shall be very sorry to go away
p01251_B,01251,B,yes i dare say you will that s natural enough i suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature in the world
p01252_B,01252,B,i hope i am not ungrateful aunt
p01253_B,01253,B,no my dear i hope not i have always found you a very good girl
p01254_B,01254,B,and am i never to live here again
p01255_B,01255,B,never my dear but you are sure of a comfortable home it can make very little difference to you whether you are in one house or the other
p01256_B,01256,B,cousin something is going to happen which i do not like at all and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to things that i disliked at first you will not be able to do it now i am going to live entirely with my aunt norris
p01257_B,01257,B,well fanny and if the plan were not unpleasant to you i should call it an excellent one
p01258_B,01258,B,oh cousin
p01259_B,01259,B,it has everything else in its favour my aunt is acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you she is choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought and i am glad her love of money does not interfere you will be what you ought to be to her i hope it does not distress you very much fanny
p01260_B,01260,B,indeed it does i cannot like it i love this house and everything in it i shall love nothing there you know how uncomfortable i feel with her
p01261_B,01261,B,i can say nothing for her manner to you as a child but it was the same with us all or nearly so she never knew how to be pleasant to children but you are now of an age to be treated better i think she is behaving better already and when you are her only companion you must be important to her
p01262_B,01262,B,i can never be important to any one
p01263_B,01263,B,what is to prevent you
p01264_B,01264,B,everything my situation my foolishness and awkwardness
p01265_B,01265,B,as to your foolishness and awkwardness my dear fanny believe me you never have a shadow of either but in using the words so improperly there is no reason in the world why you should not be important where you are known you have good sense and a sweet temper and i am sure you have a grateful heart that could never receive kindness without wishing to return it i do not know any better qualifications for a friend and companion
p01266_B,01266,B,you are too kind how shall i ever thank you as i ought for thinking so well of me oh cousin if i am to go away i shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my life
p01267_B,01267,B,why indeed fanny i should hope to be remembered at such a distance as the white house you speak as if you were going two hundred miles off instead of only across the park but you will belong to us almost as much as ever the two families will be meeting every day in the year the only difference will be that living with your aunt you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be here there are too many whom you can hide behind but with her you will be forced to speak for yourself
p01268_B,01268,B,oh do not say so
p01269_B,01269,B,i must say it and say it with pleasure mrs norris is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now she is of a temper to do a great deal for anybody she really interests herself about and she will force you to do justice to your natural powers
p01270_B,01270,B,i cannot see things as you do but i ought to believe you to be right rather than myself and i am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be if i could suppose my aunt really to care for me it would be delightful to feel myself of consequence to anybody here i know i am of none and yet i love the place so well
p01271_B,01271,B,the place fanny is what you will not quit though you quit the house you will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever even your constant little heart need not take fright at such a nominal change you will have the same walks to frequent the same library to choose from the same people to look at the same horse to ride
p01272_B,01272,B,very true yes dear old grey pony ah cousin when i remember how much i used to dread riding what terrors it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good oh how i have trembled at my uncle s opening his lips if horses were talked of and then think of the kind pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears and convince me that i should like it after a little while and feel how right you proved to be i am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well
p01273_B,01273,B,and i am quite convinced that your being with mrs norris will be as good for your mind as riding has been for your health and as much for your ultimate happiness too
p01274_B,01274,B,live with me dear lady bertram what do you mean
p01275_B,01275,B,is she not to live with you i thought you had settled it with sir thomas
p01276_B,01276,B,me never i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas nor he to me fanny live with me the last thing in the world for me to think of or for anybody to wish that really knows us both good heaven what could i do with fanny me a poor helpless forlorn widow unfit for anything my spirits quite broke down what could i do with a girl at her time of life a girl of fifteen the very age of all others to need most attention and care and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test sure sir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing sir thomas is too much my friend nobody that wishes me well i am sure would propose it how came sir thomas to speak to you about it
p01277_B,01277,B,indeed i do not know i suppose he thought it best
p01278_B,01278,B,but what did he say he could not say he wished me to take fanny i am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it
p01279_B,01279,B,no he only said he thought it very likely and i thought so too we both thought it would be a comfort to you but if you do not like it there is no more to be said she is no encumbrance here
p01280_B,01280,B,dear sister if you consider my unhappy state how can she be any comfort to me here am i a poor desolate widow deprived of the best of husbands my health gone in attending and nursing him my spirits still worse all my peace in this world destroyed with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed what possible comfort could i have in taking such a charge upon me as fanny if i could wish it for my own sake i would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl she is in good hands and sure of doing well i must struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as i can
p01281_B,01281,B,then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone
p01282_B,01282,B,lady bertram i do not complain i know i cannot live as i have done but i must retrench where i can and learn to be a better manager i have been a liberal housekeeper enough but i shall not be ashamed to practise economy now my situation is as much altered as my income a great many things were due from poor mr norris as clergyman of the parish that cannot be expected from me it is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers at the white house matters must be better looked after i must live within my income or i shall be miserable and i own it would give me great satisfaction to be able to do rather more to lay by a little at the end of the year
p01283_B,01283,B,i dare say you will you always do don t you
p01284_B,01284,B,my object lady bertram is to be of use to those that come after me it is for your children s good that i wish to be richer i have nobody else to care for but i should be very glad to think i could leave a little trifle among them worth their having
p01285_B,01285,B,you are very good but do not trouble yourself about them they are sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of that
p01286_B,01286,B,why you know sir thomas s means will be rather straitened if the antigua estate is to make such poor returns
p01287_B,01287,B,oh that will soon be settled sir thomas has been writing about it i know
p01288_B,01288,B,well lady bertram i can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family and so if sir thomas should ever speak again about my taking fanny you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question besides that i really should not have a bed to give her for i must keep a spare room for a friend
p01289_B,01289,B,if poor sir thomas were fated never to return it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear maria well married
p01290_B,01290,B,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry
p01291_B,01291,B,my dear brother i will not believe this of you
p01292_B,01292,B,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p01293_B,01293,B,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him
p01294_B,01294,B,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p01295_B,01295,B,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage
p01296_B,01296,B,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls
p01297_B,01297,B,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best
p01298_B,01298,B,oh yes i like julia best
p01299_B,01299,B,but do you really for miss bertram is in general thought the handsomest
p01300_B,01300,B,so i should suppose she has the advantage in every feature and i prefer her countenance but i like julia best miss bertram is certainly the handsomest and i have found her the most agreeable but i shall always like julia best because you order me
p01301_B,01301,B,i shall not talk to you henry but i know you will like her best at last
p01302_B,01302,B,do not i tell you that i like her best at first
p01303_B,01303,B,and besides miss bertram is engaged remember that my dear brother her choice is made
p01304_B,01304,B,yes and i like her the better for it an engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged she is satisfied with herself her cares are over and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion all is safe with a lady engaged no harm can be done
p01305_B,01305,B,why as to that mr rushworth is a very good sort of young man and it is a great match for her
p01306_B,01306,B,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart
p01307_B,01307,B,mary how shall we manage him
p01308_B,01308,B,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last
p01309_B,01309,B,but i would not have him taken in i would not have him duped i would have it all fair and honourable
p01310_B,01310,B,oh dear let him stand his chance and be taken in it will do just as well everybody is taken in at some period or other
p01311_B,01311,B,not always in marriage dear mary
p01312_B,01312,B,in marriage especially with all due respect to such of the present company as chance to be married my dear mrs grant there is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry look where i will i see that it is so and i feel that it must be so when i consider that it is of all transactions the one in which people expect most from others and are least honest themselves
p01313_B,01313,B,ah you have been in a bad school for matrimony in hill street
p01314_B,01314,B,my poor aunt had certainly little cause to love the state but however speaking from my own observation it is a manoeuvring business i know so many who have married in the full expectation and confidence of some one particular advantage in the connexion or accomplishment or good quality in the person who have found themselves entirely deceived and been obliged to put up with exactly the reverse what is this but a take in
p01315_B,01315,B,my dear child there must be a little imagination here i beg your pardon but i cannot quite believe you depend upon it you see but half you see the evil but you do not see the consolation there will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere and we are all apt to expect too much but then if one scheme of happiness fails human nature turns to another if the first calculation is wrong we make a second better we find comfort somewhere and those evil minded observers dearest mary who make much of a little are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves
p01316_B,01316,B,well done sister i honour your esprit du corps when i am a wife i mean to be just as staunch myself and i wish my friends in general would be so too it would save me many a heartache
p01317_B,01317,B,you are as bad as your brother mary but we will cure you both mansfield shall cure you both and without any taking in stay with us and we will cure you
p01318_B,01318,B,i begin now to understand you all except miss price pray is she out or is she not i am puzzled she dined at the parsonage with the rest of you which seemed like being out and yet she says so little that i can hardly suppose she is
p01319_B,01319,B,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me
p01320_B,01320,B,and yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained the distinction is so broad manners as well as appearance are generally speaking so totally different till now i could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl s being out or not a girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word you may smile but it is so i assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper girls should be quiet and modest the most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence that is the faulty part of the present system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr bertram i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes
p01321_B,01321,B,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson
p01322_B,01322,B,no indeed miss anderson i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will quiz you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about
p01323_B,01323,B,ah you carry it off very well but i cannot be quite so far imposed on you must have had miss anderson in your eye in describing an altered young lady you paint too accurately for mistake it was exactly so the andersons of baker street we were speaking of them the other day you know edmund you have heard me mention charles anderson the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it when anderson first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not out and i could not get her to speak to me i sat there an hour one morning waiting for anderson with only her and a little girl or two in the room the governess being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business and i could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady nothing like a civil answer she screwed up her mouth and turned from me with such an air i did not see her again for a twelvemonth she was then out i met her at mrs holford s and did not recollect her she came up to me claimed me as an acquaintance stared me out of countenance and talked and laughed till i did not know which way to look i felt that i must be the jest of the room at the time and miss crawford it is plain has heard the story
p01324_B,01324,B,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong
p01325_B,01325,B,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right
p01326_B,01326,B,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p01327_B,01327,B,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting
p01328_B,01328,B,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p01329_B,01329,B,that was bad indeed poor miss sneyd though i have no younger sister i feel for her to be neglected before one s time must be very vexatious but it was entirely the mother s fault miss augusta should have been with her governess such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does she dine out every where as well as at my sister s
p01330_B,01330,B,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her
p01331_B,01331,B,oh then the point is clear miss price is not out
p01332_B,01332,B,oh for shame a prison indeed sotherton court is the noblest old place in the world
p01333_B,01333,B,it wants improvement ma am beyond anything i never saw a place that wanted so much improvement in my life and it is so forlorn that i do not know what can be done with it
p01334_B,01334,B,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p01335_B,01335,B,i must try to do something with it but i do not know what i hope i shall have some good friend to help me
p01336_B,01336,B,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p01337_B,01337,B,that is what i was thinking of as he has done so well by smith i think i had better have him at once his terms are five guineas a day
p01338_B,01338,B,well and if they were ten i am sure you need not regard it the expense need not be any impediment if i were you i should not think of the expense i would have everything done in the best style and made as nice as possible such a place as sotherton court deserves everything that taste and money can do you have space to work upon there and grounds that will well reward you for my own part if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton i should be always planting and improving for naturally i am excessively fond of it it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where i am now with my little half acre it would be quite a burlesque but if i had more room i should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it you young ones do not remember much about it perhaps but if dear sir thomas were here he could tell you what improvements we made and a great deal more would have been done but for poor mr norris s sad state of health he could hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything and that disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to talk of if it had not been for that we should have carried on the garden wall and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard just as dr grant has done we were always doing something as it was it was only the spring twelvemonth before mr norris s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall which is now grown such a noble tree and getting to such perfection sir
p01339_B,01339,B,the tree thrives well beyond a doubt madam the soil is good and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering
p01340_B,01340,B,sir it is a moor park we bought it as a moor park and it cost us that is it was a present from sir thomas but i saw the bill and i know it cost seven shillings and was charged as a moor park
p01341_B,01341,B,you were imposed on ma am these potatoes have as much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree it is an insipid fruit at the best but a good apricot is eatable which none from my garden are
p01342_B,01342,B,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p01343_B,01343,B,smith s place is the admiration of all the country and it was a mere nothing before repton took it in hand i think i shall have repton
p01344_B,01344,B,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p01345_B,01345,B,smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds which is little enough and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved now at sotherton we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows so that i think if so much could be done at compton we need not despair there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house and it opens the prospect amazingly which makes me think that repton or anybody of that sort would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill you know
p01346_B,01346,B,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p01347_B,01347,B,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited
p01348_B,01348,B,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny
p01349_B,01349,B,i should like to see sotherton before it is cut down to see the place as it is now in its old state but i do not suppose i shall
p01350_B,01350,B,have you never been there no you never can and unluckily it is out of distance for a ride i wish we could contrive it
p01351_B,01351,B,oh it does not signify whenever i do see it you will tell me how it has been altered
p01352_B,01352,B,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well
p01353_B,01353,B,he is a well bred man he makes the best of it
p01354_B,01354,B,you would know what you were about of course but that would not suit me i have no eye or ingenuity for such matters but as they are before me and had i a place of my own in the country i should be most thankful to any mr repton who would undertake it and give me as much beauty as he could for my money and i should never look at it till it was complete
p01355_B,01355,B,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p01356_B,01356,B,ay you have been brought up to it it was no part of my education and the only dose i ever had being administered by not the first favourite in the world has made me consider improvements in hand as the greatest of nuisances three years ago the admiral my honoured uncle bought a cottage at twickenham for us all to spend our summers in and my aunt and i went down to it quite in raptures but it being excessively pretty it was soon found necessary to be improved and for three months we were all dirt and confusion without a gravel walk to step on or a bench fit for use i would have everything as complete as possible in the country shrubberies and flower gardens and rustic seats innumerable but it must all be done without my care henry is different he loves to be doing mr bertram i have tidings of my harp at last i am assured that it is safe at northampton and there it has probably been these ten days in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often received to the contrary the truth is that our inquiries were too direct we sent a servant we went ourselves this will not do seventy miles from london but this morning we heard of it in the right way it was seen by some farmer and he told the miller and the miller told the butcher and the butcher s son in law left word at the shop
p01357_B,01357,B,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay
p01358_B,01358,B,i am to have it to morrow but how do you think it is to be conveyed not by a wagon or cart oh no nothing of that kind could be hired in the village i might as well have asked for porters and a handbarrow
p01359_B,01359,B,you would find it difficult i dare say just now in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart
p01360_B,01360,B,i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly and as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farmyard nor walk in the shrubbery without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the labourers all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s bailiff i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at
p01361_B,01361,B,you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a cart at any time might not be so easy as you suppose our farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse
p01362_B,01362,B,i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london maxim that everything is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has offered to fetch it in his barouche will it not be honourably conveyed i shall be most happy to play to you both at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best off for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr bertram if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery about it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose
p01363_B,01363,B,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing
p01364_B,01364,B,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter
p01365_B,01365,B,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p01366_B,01366,B,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us
p01367_B,01367,B,at sea has she in the king s service of course
p01368_B,01368,B,do you know anything of my cousin s captain captain marshall you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude
p01369_B,01369,B,among admirals large enough but we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various admirals i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the gradation of their pay and their bickerings and jealousies but in general i can assure you that they are all passed over and all very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of admirals of rears and vices i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a pun i entreat
p01370_B,01370,B,it is a noble profession
p01371_B,01371,B,yes the profession is well enough under two circumstances if it make the fortune and there be discretion in spending it but in short it is not a favourite profession of mine it has never worn an amiable form to me
p01372_B,01372,B,nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it but i fear there would be some disappointment you would not find it equal to your present ideas in extent it is a mere nothing you would be surprised at its insignificance and as for improvement there was very little for me to do too little i should like to have been busy much longer
p01373_B,01373,B,you are fond of the sort of thing
p01374_B,01374,B,excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little remained to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before everingham was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a devourer of my own
p01375_B,01375,B,those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly you can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth you should assist him with your opinion
p01376_B,01376,B,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p01377_B,01377,B,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday
p01378_B,01378,B,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her
p01379_B,01379,B,it is her countenance that is so attractive she has a wonderful play of feature but was there nothing in her conversation that struck you fanny as not quite right
p01380_B,01380,B,oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an uncle with whom she has been living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating him they say quite like a son i could not have believed it
p01381_B,01381,B,i thought you would be struck it was very wrong very indecorous
p01382_B,01382,B,and very ungrateful i think
p01383_B,01383,B,ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that her uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt s memory which misleads her here she is awkwardly circumstanced with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs crawford without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their disagreements though the admiral s present conduct might incline one to the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss crawford should acquit her aunt entirely i do not censure her opinions but there certainly is impropriety in making them public
p01384_B,01384,B,do not you think that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon mrs crawford as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral
p01385_B,01385,B,that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection
p01386_B,01386,B,yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure william would never have used me so under any circumstances and what right had she to suppose that you would not write long letters when you were absent
p01387_B,01387,B,the right of a lively mind fanny seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others perfectly allowable when untinctured by ill humour or roughness and there is not a shadow of either in the countenance or manner of miss crawford nothing sharp or loud or coarse she is perfectly feminine except in the instances we have been speaking of there she cannot be justified i am glad you saw it all as i did
p01388_B,01388,B,for there is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice as far as she ever goes and you have been promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off half an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then i wish you may not be fatigued by so much exercise i wish you had saved yourself this walk home
p01389_B,01389,B,no part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse i assure you i am very strong nothing ever fatigues me but doing what i do not like miss price i give way to you with a very bad grace but i sincerely hope you will have a pleasant ride and that i may have nothing but good to hear of this dear delightful beautiful animal
p01390_B,01390,B,yes and her spirits are as good and she has the same energy of character i cannot but think that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind
p01391_B,01391,B,i do not want her at all for myself but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home i think miss crawford would be glad to have her a longer time for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mansfield common mrs grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have no doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any morning will do for this she would be extremely sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health
p01392_B,01392,B,i shall not ride to morrow certainly i have been out very often lately and would rather stay at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well
p01393_B,01393,B,but where is fanny is she gone to bed
p01394_B,01394,B,no not that i know of she was here a moment ago
p01395_B,01395,B,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p01396_B,01396,B,fanny i am sure you have the headache i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it
p01397_B,01397,B,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p01398_B,01398,B,did you go out in the heat
p01399_B,01399,B,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p01400_B,01400,B,yes indeed edmund i was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while fanny cut the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the alcove but i declare i quite dreaded the coming home again
p01401_B,01401,B,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p01402_B,01402,B,yes and i am afraid they will be the last this year poor thing she found it hot enough but they were so full blown that one could not wait
p01403_B,01403,B,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p01404_B,01404,B,she has got it she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time
p01405_B,01405,B,what has she been walking as well as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head aches
p01406_B,01406,B,i was afraid it would be too much for her but when the roses were gathered your aunt wished to have them and then you know they must be taken home
p01407_B,01407,B,but were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice
p01408_B,01408,B,no but they were to be put into the spare room to dry and unluckily fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key so she was obliged to go again
p01409_B,01409,B,and could nobody be employed on such an errand but fanny upon my word ma am it has been a very ill managed business
p01410_B,01410,B,i wish fanny had half your strength ma am
p01411_B,01411,B,if fanny would be more regular in her exercise she would not be knocked up so soon she has not been out on horseback now this long while and i am persuaded that when she does not ride she ought to walk if she had been riding before i should not have asked it of her but i thought it would rather do her good after being stooping among the roses for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind and though the sun was strong it was not so very hot between ourselves edmund it was cutting the roses and dawdling about in the flower garden that did the mischief
p01412_B,01412,B,the fatigue would be too much for my sister a great deal too much i assure you my dear mrs rushworth ten miles there and ten back you know you must excuse my sister on this occasion and accept of our two dear girls and myself without her sotherton is the only place that could give her a wish to go so far but it cannot be indeed she will have a companion in fanny price you know so it will all do very well and as for edmund as he is not here to speak for himself i will answer for his being most happy to join the party he can go on horseback you know
p01413_B,01413,B,the loss of her ladyship s company would be a great drawback and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it was a pity she should not see the place
p01414_B,01414,B,you are very kind you are all kindness my dear madam but as to fanny she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing sotherton she has time enough before her and her going now is quite out of the question lady bertram could not possibly spare her
p01415_B,01415,B,oh no i cannot do without fanny
p01416_B,01416,B,what go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather when we may have seats in a barouche no my dear edmund that will not quite do
p01417_B,01417,B,besides i know that mr crawford depends upon taking us after what passed at first he would claim it as a promise
p01418_B,01418,B,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p01419_B,01419,B,that would not be a very handsome reason for using mr crawford s but the truth is that wilcox is a stupid old fellow and does not know how to drive i will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from narrow roads on wednesday
p01420_B,01420,B,there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the barouche box
p01421_B,01421,B,unpleasant oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss crawford will choose the barouche box herself
p01422_B,01422,B,there can be no objection then to fanny s going with you there can be no doubt of your having room for her
p01423_B,01423,B,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p01424_B,01424,B,you can have no reason i imagine madam for wishing fanny not to be of the party but as it relates to yourself to your own comfort if you could do without her you would not wish to keep her at home
p01425_B,01425,B,to be sure not but i cannot do without her
p01426_B,01426,B,you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do yes there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home fanny has a great desire to see sotherton i know she wishes it very much she has not often a gratification of the kind and i am sure ma am you would be glad to give her the pleasure now
p01427_B,01427,B,oh yes very glad if your aunt sees no objection
p01428_B,01428,B,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p01429_B,01429,B,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p01430_B,01430,B,i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you
p01431_B,01431,B,fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires
p01432_B,01432,B,here is a fine burst of country i wish you had my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me press you ever so much
p01433_B,01433,B,now we shall have no more rough road miss crawford our difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the parsonage a tidy looking house and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people those are almshouses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respectable man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach
p01434_B,01434,B,now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore must be at the back of it mr rushworth talked of the west front
p01435_B,01435,B,yes it is exactly behind the house begins at a little distance and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds you may see something of it here something of the more distant trees it is oak entirely
p01436_B,01436,B,i am disappointed this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a
p01437_B,01437,B,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements
p01438_B,01438,B,it was foolish of me not to think of all that but i am disappointed
p01439_B,01439,B,every generation has its improvements
p01440_B,01440,B,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p01441_B,01441,B,very fine indeed it must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business and pleasure and say their prayers here twice a day while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying away
p01442_B,01442,B,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom
p01443_B,01443,B,at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own devices on such subjects everybody likes to go their own way to chuse their own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the formality the restraint the length of time altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a headache without danger of reprobation because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles of the house of rushworth did many a time repair to this chapel the young mrs eleanors and mrs bridgets starched up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different especially if the poor chaplain were not worth looking at and in those days i fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they are now
p01444_B,01444,B,your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects you have given us an amusing sketch and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent thing that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private devotions of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected in a closet
p01445_B,01445,B,yes very likely they would have two chances at least in their favour there would be less to distract the attention from without and it would not be tried so long
p01446_B,01446,B,the mind which does not struggle against itself under one circumstance would find objects to distract it in the other i believe and the influence of the place and of example may often rouse better feelings than are begun with the greater length of the service however i admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind one wishes it were not so but i have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are
p01447_B,01447,B,i do not like to see miss bertram so near the altar
p01448_B,01448,B,if he would give her away
p01449_B,01449,B,i am afraid i should do it very awkwardly
p01450_B,01450,B,how distressed she will be at what she said just now
p01451_B,01451,B,yes i shall take orders soon after my father s return probably at christmas
p01452_B,01452,B,if i had known this before i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect
p01453_B,01453,B,suppose we turn down here for the present here are the greatest number of our plants and here are the curious pheasants
p01454_B,01454,B,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p01455_B,01455,B,james i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party the miss bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet
p01456_B,01456,B,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me
p01457_B,01457,B,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor
p01458_B,01458,B,very true but in short it had not occurred to me and you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the second son
p01459_B,01459,B,a very praiseworthy practice but not quite universal i am one of the exceptions and being one must do something for myself
p01460_B,01460,B,but why are you to be a clergyman i thought that was always the lot of the youngest where there were many to chuse before him
p01461_B,01461,B,do you think the church itself never chosen then
p01462_B,01462,B,never is a black word but yes in the never of conversation which means not very often i do think it for what is to be done in the church men love to distinguish themselves and in either of the other lines distinction may be gained but not in the church a clergyman is nothing
p01463_B,01463,B,the nothing of conversation has its gradations i hope as well as the never a clergyman cannot be high in state or fashion he must not head mobs or set the ton in dress but i cannot call that situation nothing which has the charge of all that is of the first importance to mankind individually or collectively considered temporally and eternally which has the guardianship of religion and morals and consequently of the manners which result from their influence no one here can call the office nothing if the man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his duty by foregoing its just importance and stepping out of his place to appear what he ought not to appear
p01464_B,01464,B,you assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one has been used to hear given or than i can quite comprehend one does not see much of this influence and importance in society and how can it be acquired where they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sermons a week even supposing them worth hearing supposing the preacher to have the sense to prefer blair s to his own do all that you speak of govern the conduct and fashion the manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit
p01465_B,01465,B,you are speaking of london i am speaking of the nation at large
p01466_B,01466,B,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest
p01467_B,01467,B,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation
p01468_B,01468,B,i wish i could convince miss crawford too
p01469_B,01469,B,i do not think you ever will i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you should intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law
p01470_B,01470,B,go into the law with as much ease as i was told to go into this wilderness
p01471_B,01471,B,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you
p01472_B,01472,B,you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent my saying a bon mot for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour together without striking it out
p01473_B,01473,B,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p01474_B,01474,B,my dear fanny how thoughtless i have been i hope you are not very tired perhaps my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm
p01475_B,01475,B,thank you but i am not at all tired
p01476_B,01476,B,you scarcely touch me you do not make me of any use what a difference in the weight of a woman s arm from that of a man at oxford i have been a good deal used to have a man lean on me for the length of a street and you are only a fly in the comparison
p01477_B,01477,B,i am really not tired which i almost wonder at for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood do not you think we have
p01478_B,01478,B,not half a mile
p01479_B,01479,B,oh you do not consider how much we have wound about we have taken such a very serpentine course and the wood itself must be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path
p01480_B,01480,B,but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked down the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a furlong in length
p01481_B,01481,B,oh i know nothing of your furlongs but i am sure it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass
p01482_B,01482,B,we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here do you think we are walking four miles an hour
p01483_B,01483,B,oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a watch
p01484_B,01484,B,i am afraid you are very tired fanny why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon miss crawford except riding
p01485_B,01485,B,how abominable in you then to let me engross her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of myself but it shall never happen again
p01486_B,01486,B,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me
p01487_B,01487,B,that she should be tired now however gives me no surprise for there is nothing in the course of one s duties so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning seeing a great house dawdling from one room to another straining one s eyes and one s attention hearing what one does not understand admiring what one does not care for it is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world and miss price has found it so though she did not know it
p01488_B,01488,B,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p01489_B,01489,B,i must move resting fatigues me i have looked across the ha ha till i am weary i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view without being able to see it so well
p01490_B,01490,B,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile
p01491_B,01491,B,it is an immense distance i see that with a glance
p01492_B,01492,B,poor dear fanny how ill you have been used by them you had better have staid with us
p01493_B,01493,B,it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far from the house already
p01494_B,01494,B,yes there is nothing else to be done but now sincerely do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected
p01495_B,01495,B,no indeed far otherwise i find it better grander more complete in its style though that style may not be the best and to tell you the truth i do not think that i shall ever see sotherton again with so much pleasure as i do now another summer will hardly improve it to me
p01496_B,01496,B,you are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world if other people think sotherton improved i have no doubt that you will
p01497_B,01497,B,i am afraid i am not quite so much the man of the world as might be good for me in some points my feelings are not quite so evanescent nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world
p01498_B,01498,B,you seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning i was glad to see you so well entertained you and julia were laughing the whole way
p01499_B,01499,B,were we yes i believe we were but i have not the least recollection at what oh i believe i was relating to her some ridiculous stories of an old irish groom of my uncle s your sister loves to laugh
p01500_B,01500,B,you think her more light hearted than i am
p01501_B,01501,B,more easily amused consequently you know better company i could not have hoped to entertain you with irish anecdotes during a ten miles drive
p01502_B,01502,B,naturally i believe i am as lively as julia but i have more to think of now
p01503_B,01503,B,you have undoubtedly and there are situations in which very high spirits would denote insensibility your prospects however are too fair to justify want of spirits you have a very smiling scene before you
p01504_B,01504,B,do you mean literally or figuratively literally i conclude yes certainly the sun shines and the park looks very cheerful but unluckily that iron gate that ha ha give me a feeling of restraint and hardship i cannot get out as the starling said mr rushworth is so long fetching this key
p01505_B,01505,B,and for the world you would not get out without the key and without mr rushworth s authority and protection or i think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate here with my assistance i think it might be done if you really wished to be more at large and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited
p01506_B,01506,B,prohibited nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr rushworth will be here in a moment you know we shall not be out of sight
p01507_B,01507,B,or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll the grove of oak on the knoll
p01508_B,01508,B,you will hurt yourself miss bertram you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes you will tear your gown you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go
p01509_B,01509,B,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye
p01510_B,01510,B,but julia mr rushworth will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr rushworth
p01511_B,01511,B,not i indeed i have had enough of the family for one morning why child i have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother such a penance as i have been enduring while you were sitting here so composed and so happy it might have been as well perhaps if you had been in my place but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes yes yes we saw him he was posting away as if upon life and death and could but just spare time to tell us his errand and where you all were
p01512_B,01512,B,it is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing
p01513_B,01513,B,that is miss maria s concern i am not obliged to punish myself for her sins the mother i could not avoid as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the housekeeper but the son i can get away from
p01514_B,01514,B,they desired me to stay my cousin maria charged me to say that you would find them at that knoll or thereabouts
p01515_B,01515,B,i do not believe i shall go any farther i see nothing of them by the time i get to the knoll they may be gone somewhere else i have had walking enough
p01516_B,01516,B,i am very sorry it is very unlucky
p01517_B,01517,B,i think they might as well have staid for me
p01518_B,01518,B,miss bertram thought you would follow her
p01519_B,01519,B,i should not have had to follow her if she had staid pray miss price are you such a great admirer of this mr crawford as some people are for my part i can see nothing in him
p01520_B,01520,B,i do not think him at all handsome
p01521_B,01521,B,handsome nobody can call such an undersized man handsome he is not five foot nine i should not wonder if he is not more than five foot eight i think he is an ill looking fellow in my opinion these crawfords are no addition at all we did very well without them if i had made any difficulty about fetching the key there might have been some excuse but i went the very moment she said she wanted it
p01522_B,01522,B,nothing could be more obliging than your manner i am sure and i dare say you walked as fast as you could but still it is some distance you know from this spot to the house quite into the house and when people are waiting they are bad judges of time and every half minute seems like five it is a pity you should not join them they expected to have a better view of the house from that part of the park and will be thinking how it may be improved and nothing of that sort you know can be settled without you
p01523_B,01523,B,well if you really think i had better go it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing
p01524_B,01524,B,i think you have done pretty well yourself ma am your lap seems full of good things and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully
p01525_B,01525,B,my dear it is only a beautiful little heath which that nice old gardener would make me take but if it is in your way i will have it in my lap directly there fanny you shall carry that parcel for me take great care of it do not let it fall it is a cream cheese just like the excellent one we had at dinner nothing would satisfy that good old mrs whitaker but my taking one of the cheeses i stood out as long as i could till the tears almost came into her eyes and i knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with that mrs whitaker is a treasure she was quite shocked when i asked her whether wine was allowed at the second table and she has turned away two housemaids for wearing white gowns take care of the cheese fanny now i can manage the other parcel and the basket very well
p01526_B,01526,B,what else have you been spunging
p01527_B,01527,B,spunging my dear it is nothing but four of those beautiful pheasants eggs which mrs whitaker would quite force upon me she would not take a denial she said it must be such an amusement to me as she understood i lived quite alone to have a few living creatures of that sort and so to be sure it will i shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first spare hen and if they come to good i can have them moved to my own house and borrow a coop and it will be a great delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them and if i have good luck your mother shall have some
p01528_B,01528,B,it will indeed after such an absence an absence not only long but including so many dangers
p01529_B,01529,B,it will be the forerunner also of other interesting events your sister s marriage and your taking orders
p01530_B,01530,B,there is no sacrifice in the case it is entirely her own doing
p01531_B,01531,B,oh yes i know it is i was merely joking she has done no more than what every young woman would do and i have no doubt of her being extremely happy my other sacrifice of course you do not understand
p01532_B,01532,B,my taking orders i assure you is quite as voluntary as maria s marrying
p01533_B,01533,B,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts
p01534_B,01534,B,which you suppose has biassed me
p01535_B,01535,B,but that i am sure it has not
p01536_B,01536,B,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly
p01537_B,01537,B,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear
p01538_B,01538,B,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors
p01539_B,01539,B,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision
p01540_B,01540,B,what take orders without a living no that is madness indeed absolute madness
p01541_B,01541,B,shall i ask you how the church is to be filled if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without no for you certainly would not know what to say but i must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument as he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession as heroism and noise and fashion are all against him he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his
p01542_B,01542,B,oh no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made to the trouble of working for one and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat drink and grow fat it is indolence mr bertram indeed indolence and love of ease a want of all laudable ambition of taste for good company or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable which make men clergymen a clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish read the newspaper watch the weather and quarrel with his wife his curate does all the work and the business of his own life is to dine
p01543_B,01543,B,there are such clergymen no doubt but i think they are not so common as to justify miss crawford in esteeming it their general character i suspect that in this comprehensive and may i say commonplace censure you are not judging from yourself but from prejudiced persons whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing it is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy you can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively you are speaking what you have been told at your uncle s table
p01544_B,01544,B,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information
p01545_B,01545,B,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away
p01546_B,01546,B,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p01547_B,01547,B,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p01548_B,01548,B,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p01549_B,01549,B,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p01550_B,01550,B,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night
p01551_B,01551,B,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons
p01552_B,01552,B,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it
p01553_B,01553,B,there goes good humour i am sure there goes a temper which would never give pain how well she walks and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others joining them the moment she is asked what a pity that she should have been in such hands
p01554_B,01554,B,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene
p01555_B,01555,B,i like to hear your enthusiasm fanny it is a lovely night and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel in some degree as you do who have not at least been given a taste for nature in early life they lose a great deal
p01556_B,01556,B,you taught me to think and feel on the subject cousin
p01557_B,01557,B,i had a very apt scholar there s arcturus looking very bright
p01558_B,01558,B,yes and the bear i wish i could see cassiopeia
p01559_B,01559,B,we must go out on the lawn for that should you be afraid
p01560_B,01560,B,not in the least it is a great while since we have had any star gazing
p01561_B,01561,B,yes i do not know how it has happened we will stay till this is finished fanny
p01562_B,01562,B,i am rather surprised that mr crawford should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to much gayer places than mansfield
p01563_B,01563,B,it is to his credit and i dare say it gives his sister pleasure she does not like his unsettled habits
p01564_B,01564,B,what a favourite he is with my cousins
p01565_B,01565,B,yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs grant i believe suspects him of a preference for julia i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove
p01566_B,01566,B,if miss bertram were not engaged i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than julia
p01567_B,01567,B,which is perhaps more in favour of his liking julia best than you fanny may be aware for i believe it often happens that a man before he has quite made up his own mind will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the woman herself crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found himself in any danger from maria and i am not at all afraid for her after such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong
p01568_B,01568,B,yes ma am indeed there will be some satisfaction in looking on now and i think it was rather a pity they should have been obliged to part young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the common forms i wonder my son did not propose it
p01569_B,01569,B,i dare say he did ma am mr rushworth is never remiss but dear maria has such a strict sense of propriety so much of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays mrs rushworth that wish of avoiding particularity dear ma am only look at her face at this moment how different from what it was the two last dances it is quite delightful ma am to see young people so properly happy so well suited and so much the thing i cannot but think of dear sir thomas s delight and what do you say ma am to the chance of another match mr rushworth has set a good example and such things are very catching the couple above ma am do you see no symptoms there
p01570_B,01570,B,oh dear miss julia and mr crawford yes indeed a very pretty match what is his property
p01571_B,01571,B,four thousand a year
p01572_B,01572,B,very well those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have four thousand a year is a pretty estate and he seems a very genteel steady young man so i hope miss julia will be very happy
p01573_B,01573,B,it is not a settled thing ma am yet we only speak of it among friends but i have very little doubt it will be he is growing extremely particular in his attentions
p01574_B,01574,B,my dear tom as you are not dancing i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber shall you
p01575_B,01575,B,i should be most happy it would give me the greatest pleasure but that i am this moment going to dance come fanny do not be dawdling any longer or the dance will be over
p01576_B,01576,B,it is not worth complaining about but to be sure the poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted it was but three days and being only a grandmother and all happening two hundred miles off i think there would have been no great harm and it was suggested i know but lord ravenshaw who i suppose is one of the most correct men in england would not hear of it
p01577_B,01577,B,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p01578_B,01578,B,oh for the ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with
p01579_B,01579,B,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p01580_B,01580,B,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p01581_B,01581,B,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p01582_B,01582,B,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p01583_B,01583,B,nay let us do nothing by halves if we are to act let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit boxes and gallery and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so as it be a german play no matter what with a good tricking shifting afterpiece and a figure dance and a hornpipe and a song between the acts if we do not outdo ecclesford we do nothing
p01584_B,01584,B,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p01585_B,01585,B,true to see real acting good hardened real acting but i would hardly walk from this room to the next to look at the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade a set of gentlemen and ladies who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through
p01586_B,01586,B,such a horribly vile billiard table as ours is not to be met with i believe above ground i can stand it no longer and i think i may say that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again but one good thing i have just ascertained it is the very room for a theatre precisely the shape and length for it and the doors at the farther end communicating with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes by merely moving the bookcase in my father s room is the very thing we could have desired if we had sat down to wish for it and my father s room will be an excellent greenroom it seems to join the billiard room on purpose
p01587_B,01587,B,you are not serious tom in meaning to act
p01588_B,01588,B,not serious never more so i assure you what is there to surprise you in it
p01589_B,01589,B,i think it would be very wrong in a general light private theatricals are open to some objections but as we are circumstanced i must think it would be highly injudicious and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind it would shew great want of feeling on my father s account absent as he is and in some degree of constant danger and it would be imprudent i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate
p01590_B,01590,B,you take up a thing so seriously as if we were going to act three times a week till my father s return and invite all the country but it is not to be a display of that sort we mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves just to vary the scene and exercise our powers in something new we want no audience no publicity we may be trusted i think in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable and i can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own i have no fears and no scruples and as to my father s being absent it is so far from an objection that i consider it rather as a motive for the expectation of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks i shall think our time very well spent and so i am sure will he it is a very anxious period for her
p01591_B,01591,B,what is the matter i was not asleep
p01592_B,01592,B,oh dear no ma am nobody suspected you well edmund
p01593_B,01593,B,i cannot agree with you i am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it
p01594_B,01594,B,and i am convinced to the contrary nobody is fonder of the exercise of talent in young people or promotes it more than my father and for anything of the acting spouting reciting kind i think he has always a decided taste i am sure he encouraged it in us as boys how many a time have we mourned over the dead body of julius caesar and to be d and not to be d in this very room for his amusement and i am sure my name was norval every evening of my life through one christmas holidays
p01595_B,01595,B,it was a very different thing you must see the difference yourself my father wished us as schoolboys to speak well but he would never wish his grown up daughters to be acting plays his sense of decorum is strict
p01596_B,01596,B,i know all that i know my father as well as you do and i ll take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him manage your own concerns edmund and i ll take care of the rest of the family
p01597_B,01597,B,if you are resolved on acting i must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way and i think a theatre ought not to be attempted it would be taking liberties with my father s house in his absence which could not be justified
p01598_B,01598,B,for everything of that nature i will be answerable his house shall not be hurt i have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have and as to such alterations as i was suggesting just now such as moving a bookcase or unlocking a door or even as using the billiard room for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room and less in the breakfast room than we did before he went away or to my sister s pianoforte being moved from one side of the room to the other absolute nonsense
p01599_B,01599,B,the innovation if not wrong as an innovation will be wrong as an expense
p01600_B,01600,B,yes the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds something of a theatre we must have undoubtedly but it will be on the simplest plan a green curtain and a little carpenter s work and that s all and as the carpenter s work may be all done at home by christopher jackson himself it will be too absurd to talk of expense and as long as jackson is employed everything will be right with sir thomas don t imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge but yourself don t act yourself if you do not like it but don t expect to govern everybody else
p01601_B,01601,B,no as to acting myself that i absolutely protest against
p01602_B,01602,B,i have no hope there fanny if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade them and that is all i can do
p01603_B,01603,B,i should think my aunt norris would be on your side
p01604_B,01604,B,i dare say she would but she has no influence with either tom or my sisters that could be of any use and if i cannot convince them myself i shall let things take their course without attempting it through her family squabbling is the greatest evil of all and we had better do anything than be altogether by the ears
p01605_B,01605,B,this will never do we are wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many must not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making anything of it from this moment i make no difficulties i take any part you chuse to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the ravenshaws how came it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here are two capital tragic parts for yates and crawford and here is the rhyming butler for me if nobody else wants it a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and as i said before i am determined to take anything and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by anybody it is only count cassel and anhalt
p01606_B,01606,B,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p01607_B,01607,B,it falls as naturally as necessarily to her as agatha does to one or other of my sisters it can be no sacrifice on their side for it is highly comic
p01608_B,01608,B,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p01609_B,01609,B,oh yes maria must be agatha maria will be the best agatha though julia fancies she prefers tragedy i would not trust her in it there is nothing of tragedy about her she has not the look of it her features are not tragic features and she walks too quick and speaks too quick and would not keep her countenance she had better do the old countrywoman the cottager s wife you had indeed julia cottager s wife is a very pretty part i assure you the old lady relieves the high flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit you shall be cottager s wife
p01610_B,01610,B,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p01611_B,01611,B,why as to that my good friend till i and my company have really acted there must be some guesswork but i mean no disparagement to julia we cannot have two agathas and we must have one cottager s wife and i am sure i set her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied with the old butler if the part is trifling she will have more credit in making something of it and if she is so desperately bent against everything humorous let her take cottager s speeches instead of cottager s wife s and so change the parts all through he is solemn and pathetic enough i am sure it could make no difference in the play and as for cottager himself when he has got his wife s speeches i would undertake him with all my heart
p01612_B,01612,B,with all your partiality for cottager s wife it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her to accept the part she must not be left to her own complaisance her talents will be wanted in amelia amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha i consider amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece it requires great powers great nicety to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good actresses fail in the part simplicity indeed is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not it requires a gentlewoman a julia bertram you will undertake it i hope
p01613_B,01613,B,no no julia must not be amelia it is not at all the part for her she would not like it she would not do well she is too tall and robust amelia should be a small light girlish skipping figure it is fit for miss crawford and miss crawford only she looks the part and i am persuaded will do it admirably
p01614_B,01614,B,you must oblige us indeed you must when you have studied the character i am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be your choice but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions you will not refuse to visit me in prison i think i see you coming in with your basket
p01615_B,01615,B,you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering
p01616_B,01616,B,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p01617_B,01617,B,do not be afraid of my wanting the character i am not to be agatha and i am sure i will do nothing else and as to amelia it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me i quite detest her an odious little pert unnatural impudent girl i have always protested against comedy and this is comedy in its worst form
p01618_B,01618,B,i am sure i would give up the part to julia most willingly but that though i shall probably do it very ill i feel persuaded she would do it worse
p01619_B,01619,B,lovers vows
p01620_B,01620,B,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p01621_B,01621,B,but what do you do for women
p01622_B,01622,B,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p01623_B,01623,B,i should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up with us
p01624_B,01624,B,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p01625_B,01625,B,i cannot before mr yates speak what i feel as to this play without reflecting on his friends at ecclesford but i must now my dear maria tell you that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation and that i hope you will give it up i cannot but suppose you will when you have read it carefully over read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt and see how you can approve it it will not be necessary to send you to your father s judgment i am convinced
p01626_B,01626,B,we see things very differently i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few omissions and so forth which will be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and i am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation
p01627_B,01627,B,i am sorry for it but in this matter it is you who are to lead you must set the example if others have blundered it is your place to put them right and shew them what true delicacy is in all points of decorum your conduct must be law to the rest of the party
p01628_B,01628,B,i am much obliged to you edmund you mean very well i am sure but i still think you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would be the greatest indecorum i think
p01629_B,01629,B,do you imagine that i could have such an idea in my head no let your conduct be the only harangue say that on examining the part you feel yourself unequal to it that you find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can be supposed to have say this with firmness and it will be quite enough all who can distinguish will understand your motive the play will be given up and your delicacy honoured as it ought
p01630_B,01630,B,do not act anything improper my dear sir thomas would not like it fanny ring the bell i must have my dinner to be sure julia is dressed by this time
p01631_B,01631,B,i am convinced madam that sir thomas would not like it
p01632_B,01632,B,there my dear do you hear what edmund says
p01633_B,01633,B,if i were to decline the part julia would certainly take it
p01634_B,01634,B,what if she knew your reasons
p01635_B,01635,B,oh she might think the difference between us the difference in our situations that she need not be so scrupulous as i might feel necessary i am sure she would argue so no you must excuse me i cannot retract my consent it is too far settled everybody would be so disappointed tom would be quite angry and if we are so very nice we shall never act anything
p01636_B,01636,B,i was just going to say the very same thing if every play is to be objected to you will act nothing and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away and i am sure that would be a discredit to us all i do not know the play but as maria says if there is anything a little too warm and it is so with most of them it can be easily left out we must not be over precise edmund as mr rushworth is to act too there can be no harm i only wish tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began for there was the loss of half a day s work about those side doors the curtain will be a good job however the maids do their work very well and i think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings there is no occasion to put them so very close together i am of some use i hope in preventing waste and making the most of things there should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones i forgot to tell tom of something that happened to me this very day i had been looking about me in the poultry yard and was just coming out when who should i see but dick jackson making up to the servants hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand bringing them to father you may be sure mother had chanced to send him of a message to father and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board for he could not no how do without them i knew what all this meant for the servants dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads and as i hate such encroaching people the jacksons are very encroaching i have always said so just the sort of people to get all they can i said to the boy directly a great lubberly fellow of ten years old you know who ought to be ashamed of himself i ll take the boards to your father dick so get you home again as fast as you can the boy looked very silly and turned away without offering a word for i believe i might speak pretty sharp and i dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while i hate such greediness so good as your father is to the family employing the man all the year round
p01637_B,01637,B,i must really congratulate your ladyship on the play being chosen for though you have borne it with exemplary patience i am sure you must be sick of all our noise and difficulties the actors may be glad but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision and i do sincerely give you joy madam as well as mrs norris and everybody else who is in the same predicament
p01638_B,01638,B,i had my choice of the parts but i thought i should like the count best though i do not much relish the finery i am to have
p01639_B,01639,B,you chose very wisely i am sure anhalt is a heavy part
p01640_B,01640,B,the count has two and forty speeches which is no trifle
p01641_B,01641,B,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men
p01642_B,01642,B,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again
p01643_B,01643,B,your brother should take the part do not you think he would
p01644_B,01644,B,i shall not ask him
p01645_B,01645,B,my advice is that you change the play
p01646_B,01646,B,i should have no objection for though i should not particularly dislike the part of amelia if well supported that is if everything went well i shall be sorry to be an inconvenience but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table it certainly will not be taken if any part could tempt you to act i suppose it would be anhalt for he is a clergyman you know
p01647_B,01647,B,that circumstance would by no means tempt me for i should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting it must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal solemn lecturer and the man who chuses the profession itself is perhaps one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage
p01648_B,01648,B,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p01649_B,01649,B,indeed but you must for we cannot excuse you it need not frighten you it is a nothing of a part a mere nothing not above half a dozen speeches altogether and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say so you may be as creep mouse as you like but we must have you to look at
p01650_B,01650,B,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p01651_B,01651,B,it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart but i really cannot act
p01652_B,01652,B,yes yes you can act well enough for us learn your part and we will teach you all the rest you have only two scenes and as i shall be cottager i ll put you in and push you about and you will do it very well i ll answer for it
p01653_B,01653,B,no indeed mr bertram you must excuse me you cannot have an idea it would be absolutely impossible for me if i were to undertake it i should only disappoint you
p01654_B,01654,B,phoo phoo do not be so shamefaced you ll do it very well every allowance will be made for you we do not expect perfection you must get a brown gown and a white apron and a mob cap and we must make you a few wrinkles and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes and you will be a very proper little old woman
p01655_B,01655,B,you must excuse me indeed you must excuse me
p01656_B,01656,B,what a piece of work here is about nothing i am quite ashamed of you fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you take the part with a good grace and let us hear no more of the matter i entreat
p01657_B,01657,B,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p01658_B,01658,B,i am not going to urge her but i shall think her a very obstinate ungrateful girl if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her very ungrateful indeed considering who and what she is
p01659_B,01659,B,i do not like my situation this place is too hot for me
p01660_B,01660,B,as far as i am concerned i can have no objection to anything that you all think eligible have i ever seen either of the gentlemen yes mr charles maddox dined at my sister s one day did not he henry a quiet looking young man i remember him let him be applied to if you please for it will be less unpleasant to me than to have a perfect stranger
p01661_B,01661,B,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p01662_B,01662,B,i am not very sanguine as to our play and i can tell mr maddox that i shall shorten some of his speeches and a great many of my own before we rehearse together it will be very disagreeable and by no means what i expected
p01663_B,01663,B,come in
p01664_B,01664,B,can i speak with you fanny for a few minutes
p01665_B,01665,B,yes certainly
p01666_B,01666,B,i want to consult i want your opinion
p01667_B,01667,B,my opinion
p01668_B,01668,B,yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse you see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles maddox but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light
p01669_B,01669,B,yes but what can be done your brother is so determined
p01670_B,01670,B,there is but one thing to be done fanny i must take anhalt myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom it is not at all what i like no man can like being driven into the appearance of such inconsistency after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alternative can you fanny
p01671_B,01671,B,no not immediately but
p01672_B,01672,B,but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief that may of the unpleasantness that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner domesticated among us authorised to come at all hours and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all restraints to think only of the licence which every rehearsal must tend to create it is all very bad put yourself in miss crawford s place fanny consider what it would be to act amelia with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be it would be ungenerous it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so fanny you hesitate
p01673_B,01673,B,i am sorry for miss crawford but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you had resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle it will be such a triumph to the others
p01674_B,01674,B,they will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously i act but however triumph there certainly will be and i must brave it but if i can be the means of restraining the publicity of the business of limiting the exhibition of concentrating our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this concession i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than they are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs rushworth and the grants will not this be worth gaining
p01675_B,01675,B,yes it will be a great point
p01676_B,01676,B,but still it has not your approbation can you mention any other measure by which i have a chance of doing equal good
p01677_B,01677,B,no i cannot think of anything else
p01678_B,01678,B,give me your approbation then fanny i am not comfortable without it
p01679_B,01679,B,oh cousin
p01680_B,01680,B,if you are against me i ought to distrust myself and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss crawford s feelings
p01681_B,01681,B,no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her
p01682_B,01682,B,she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night it gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill
p01683_B,01683,B,she was very kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared
p01684_B,01684,B,i shall walk down immediately after breakfast and am sure of giving pleasure there and now dear fanny i will not interrupt you any longer you want to be reading but i could not be easy till i had spoken to you and come to a decision sleeping or waking my head has been full of this matter all night it is an evil but i am certainly making it less than it might be if tom is up i shall go to him directly and get it over and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such unanimity you in the meanwhile will be taking a trip into china i suppose how does lord macartney go on and here are crabbe s tales and the idler at hand to relieve you if you tire of your great book i admire your little establishment exceedingly and as soon as i am gone you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting and sit comfortably down to your table but do not stay here to be cold
p01685_B,01685,B,no she is quite determined she certainly will not act
p01686_B,01686,B,oh very well
p01687_B,01687,B,i dare say she is i imagine both sisters are
p01688_B,01688,B,both no no that must not be do not give him a hint of it think of mr rushworth
p01689_B,01689,B,you had better tell miss bertram to think of mr rushworth it may do her some good i often think of mr rushworth s property and independence and wish them in other hands but i never think of him a man might represent the county with such an estate a man might escape a profession and represent the county
p01690_B,01690,B,i dare say he will be in parliament soon when sir thomas comes i dare say he will be in for some borough but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing anything yet
p01691_B,01691,B,sir thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home do you remember hawkins browne s address to tobacco in imitation of pope i will parody them will not that do mrs grant everything seems to depend upon sir thomas s return
p01692_B,01692,B,you will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family i assure you i do not think we do so well without him he has a fine dignified manner which suits the head of such a house and keeps everybody in their place lady bertram seems more of a cipher now than when he is at home and nobody else can keep mrs norris in order but mary do not fancy that maria bertram cares for henry i am sure julia does not or she would not have flirted as she did last night with mr yates and though he and maria are very good friends i think she likes sotherton too well to be inconstant
p01693_B,01693,B,i would not give much for mr rushworth s chance if henry stept in before the articles were signed
p01694_B,01694,B,if you have such a suspicion something must be done and as soon as the play is all over we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind and if he means nothing we will send him off though he is henry for a time
p01695_B,01695,B,one cannot wonder sister that fanny should be delighted it is all new to her you know you and i used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am i still and as soon as i am a little more at leisure i mean to look in at their rehearsals too what is the play about fanny you have never told me
p01696_B,01696,B,oh sister pray do not ask her now for fanny is not one of those who can talk and work at the same time it is about lovers vows
p01697_B,01697,B,i believe there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once
p01698_B,01698,B,you had better stay till the curtain is hung the curtain will be hung in a day or two there is very little sense in a play without a curtain and i am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons
p01699_B,01699,B,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p01700_B,01700,B,none of it i suppose you are to have the book of course now for it we must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the front of the stage there very good school room chairs not made for a theatre i dare say much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson what would your governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose could sir thomas look in upon us just now he would bless himself for we are rehearsing all over the house yates is storming away in the dining room i heard him as i came upstairs and the theatre is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers agatha and frederick if they are not perfect i shall be surprised by the bye i looked in upon them five minutes ago and it happened to be exactly at one of the times when they were trying not to embrace and mr rushworth was with me i thought he began to look a little queer so i turned it off as well as i could by whispering to him we shall have an excellent agatha there is something so maternal in her manner so completely maternal in her voice and countenance was not that well done of me he brightened up directly now for my soliloquy
p01701_B,01701,B,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p01702_B,01702,B,you have only to read the part
p01703_B,01703,B,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part
p01704_B,01704,B,shall i go too had not i better go too will not it be right for me to go too
p01705_B,01705,B,sure my dear sir thomas a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea do have a basin of soup
p01706_B,01706,B,still the same anxiety for everybody s comfort my dear mrs norris but indeed i would rather have nothing but tea
p01707_B,01707,B,well then lady bertram suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry baddeley a little he seems behindhand to night
p01708_B,01708,B,how do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting
p01709_B,01709,B,indeed and what have you been acting
p01710_B,01710,B,oh they ll tell you all about it
p01711_B,01711,B,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p01712_B,01712,B,something must be done
p01713_B,01713,B,it is time to think of our visitors where did you leave miss crawford fanny
p01714_B,01714,B,then poor yates is all alone i will go and fetch him he will be no bad assistant when it all comes out
p01715_B,01715,B,this was in fact the origin of our acting my friend yates brought the infection from ecclesford and it spread as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly it was like treading old ground again
p01716_B,01716,B,oh not to him look so to all the others but not to him
p01717_B,01717,B,my indulgence shall be given sir but without any other rehearsal i come home to be happy and indulgent mr and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield do you find them agreeable acquaintance
p01718_B,01718,B,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p01719_B,01719,B,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p01720_B,01720,B,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p01721_B,01721,B,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish
p01722_B,01722,B,i know how great how justly great your influence is with lady bertram and her children and am the more concerned that it should not have been
p01723_B,01723,B,my dear sir thomas if you had seen the state of the roads that day i thought we should never have got through them though we had the four horses of course and poor old coachman would attend us out of his great love and kindness though he was hardly able to sit the box on account of the rheumatism which i had been doctoring him for ever since michaelmas i cured him at last but he was very bad all the winter and this was such a day i could not help going to him up in his room before we set off to advise him not to venture he was putting on his wig so i said coachman you had much better not go your lady and i shall be very safe you know how steady stephen is and charles has been upon the leaders so often now that i am sure there is no fear but however i soon found it would not do he was bent upon going and as i hate to be worrying and officious i said no more but my heart quite ached for him at every jolt and when we got into the rough lanes about stoke where what with frost and snow upon beds of stones it was worse than anything you can imagine i was quite in an agony about him and then the poor horses too to see them straining away you know how i always feel for the horses and when we got to the bottom of sandcroft hill what do you think i did you will laugh at me but i got out and walked up i did indeed it might not be saving them much but it was something and i could not bear to sit at my ease and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals i caught a dreadful cold but that i did not regard my object was accomplished in the visit
p01724_B,01724,B,i hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that might be taken to establish it there is nothing very striking in mr rushworth s manners but i was pleased last night with what appeared to be his opinion on one subject his decided preference of a quiet family party to the bustle and confusion of acting he seemed to feel exactly as one could wish
p01725_B,01725,B,yes indeed and the more you know of him the better you will like him he is not a shining character but he has a thousand good qualities and is so disposed to look up to you that i am quite laughed at about it for everybody considers it as my doing upon my word mrs norris said mrs grant the other day if mr rushworth were a son of your own he could not hold sir thomas in greater respect
p01726_B,01726,B,it is about my uncle s usual time
p01727_B,01727,B,when do you think of going
p01728_B,01728,B,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day
p01729_B,01729,B,whose stables do you use at bath
p01730_B,01730,B,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father
p01731_B,01731,B,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home
p01732_B,01732,B,i believe you are right fanny i believe our evenings are rather returned to what they were than assuming a new character the novelty was in their being lively yet how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give i have been feeling as if we had never lived so before
p01733_B,01733,B,i suppose i am graver than other people the evenings do not appear long to me i love to hear my uncle talk of the west indies i could listen to him for an hour together it entertains me more than many other things have done but then i am unlike other people i dare say
p01734_B,01734,B,why should you dare say that do you want to be told that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet but when did you or anybody ever get a compliment from me fanny go to my father if you want to be complimented he will satisfy you ask your uncle what he thinks and you will hear compliments enough and though they may be chiefly on your person you must put up with it and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time your uncle thinks you very pretty dear fanny and that is the long and the short of the matter anybody but myself would have made something more of it and anybody but you would resent that you had not been thought very pretty before but the truth is that your uncle never did admire you till now and now he does your complexion is so improved and you have gained so much countenance and your figure nay fanny do not turn away about it it is but an uncle if you cannot bear an uncle s admiration what is to become of you you must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at you must try not to mind growing up into a pretty woman
p01735_B,01735,B,oh don t talk so don t talk so
p01736_B,01736,B,your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect and i only wish you would talk to him more you are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle
p01737_B,01737,B,but i do talk to him more than i used i am sure i do did not you hear me ask him about the slave trade last night
p01738_B,01738,B,i did and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others it would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther
p01739_B,01739,B,and i longed to do it but there was such a dead silence and while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word or seeming at all interested in the subject i did not like i thought it would appear as if i wanted to set myself off at their expense by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel
p01740_B,01740,B,miss crawford was very right in what she said of you the other day that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women were of neglect we were talking of you at the parsonage and those were her words she has great discernment i know nobody who distinguishes characters better for so young a woman it is remarkable she certainly understands you better than you are understood by the greater part of those who have known you so long and with regard to some others i can perceive from occasional lively hints the unguarded expressions of the moment that she could define many as accurately did not delicacy forbid it i wonder what she thinks of my father she must admire him as a fine looking man with most gentlemanlike dignified consistent manners but perhaps having seen him so seldom his reserve may be a little repulsive could they be much together i feel sure of their liking each other he would enjoy her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers i wish they met more frequently i hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on his side
p01741_B,01741,B,she must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of you to have any such apprehension and sir thomas s wishing just at first to be only with his family is so very natural that she can argue nothing from that after a little while i dare say we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way allowing for the difference of the time of year
p01742_B,01742,B,this is the first october that she has passed in the country since her infancy i do not call tunbridge or cheltenham the country and november is a still more serious month and i can see that mrs grant is very anxious for her not finding mansfield dull as winter comes on
p01743_B,01743,B,to morrow i think my uncle dines at sotherton and you and mr bertram too we shall be quite a small party at home i hope my uncle may continue to like mr rushworth
p01744_B,01744,B,that is impossible fanny he must like him less after to morrow s visit for we shall be five hours in his company i should dread the stupidity of the day if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on sir thomas he cannot much longer deceive himself i am sorry for them all and would give something that rushworth and maria had never met
p01745_B,01745,B,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south
p01746_B,01746,B,south or north i know a black cloud when i see it and you must not set forward while it is so threatening and besides i want to play something more to you a very pretty piece and your cousin edmund s prime favourite you must stay and hear your cousin s favourite
p01747_B,01747,B,this is pretty very pretty every time i come into this shrubbery i am more struck with its growth and beauty three years ago this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the field never thought of as anything or capable of becoming anything and now it is converted into a walk and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament and perhaps in another three years we may be forgetting almost forgetting what it was before how wonderful how very wonderful the operations of time and the changes of the human mind if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences the memory is sometimes so retentive so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered and so weak and at others again so tyrannic so beyond control we are to be sure a miracle every way but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out it may seem impertinent in me to praise but i must admire the taste mrs grant has shewn in all this there is such a quiet simplicity in the plan of the walk not too much attempted
p01748_B,01748,B,yes it does very well for a place of this sort one does not think of extent here and between ourselves till i came to mansfield i had not imagined a country parson ever aspired to a shrubbery or anything of the kind
p01749_B,01749,B,i am so glad to see the evergreens thrive my uncle s gardener always says the soil here is better than his own and so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general the evergreen how beautiful how welcome how wonderful the evergreen when one thinks of it how astonishing a variety of nature in some countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety but that does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their existence you will think me rhapsodising but when i am out of doors especially when i am sitting out of doors i am very apt to get into this sort of wondering strain one cannot fix one s eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy
p01750_B,01750,B,to say the truth i am something like the famous doge at the court of lewis xiv and may declare that i see no wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it if anybody had told me a year ago that this place would be my home that i should be spending month after month here as i have done i certainly should not have believed them i have now been here nearly five months and moreover the quietest five months i ever passed
p01751_B,01751,B,too quiet for you i believe
p01752_B,01752,B,i should have thought so theoretically myself but take it all and all i never spent so happy a summer but then there is no saying what it may lead to i am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence than i had ever expected to be i can even suppose it pleasant to spend half the year in the country under certain circumstances very pleasant an elegant moderate sized house in the centre of family connexions continual engagements among them commanding the first society in the neighbourhood looked up to perhaps as leading it even more than those of larger fortune and turning from the cheerful round of such amusements to nothing worse than a t te t te with the person one feels most agreeable in the world there is nothing frightful in such a picture is there miss price one need not envy the new mrs rushworth with such a home as that
p01753_B,01753,B,envy mrs rushworth come come it would be very un handsome in us to be severe on mrs rushworth for i look forward to our owing her a great many gay brilliant happy hours i expect we shall be all very much at sotherton another year such a match as miss bertram has made is a public blessing for the first pleasures of mr rushworth s wife must be to fill her house and give the best balls in the country
p01754_B,01754,B,ah here he is my sister and mr bertram i am so glad your eldest cousin is gone that he may be mr bertram again there is something in the sound of mr edmund bertram so formal so pitiful so younger brother like that i detest it
p01755_B,01755,B,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections
p01756_B,01756,B,i grant you the name is good in itself and lord edmund or sir edmund sound delightfully but sink it under the chill the annihilation of a mr and mr edmund is no more than mr john or mr thomas well shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year by being up before they can begin
p01757_B,01757,B,perhaps i might have scolded if either of you had been sitting down alone but while you do wrong together i can overlook a great deal
p01758_B,01758,B,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p01759_B,01759,B,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may
p01760_B,01760,B,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little
p01761_B,01761,B,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close
p01762_B,01762,B,the sweets of housekeeping in a country village commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer
p01763_B,01763,B,my dear child commend dr grant to the deanery of westminster or st paul s and i should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you could be but we have no such people in mansfield what would you have me do
p01764_B,01764,B,oh you can do nothing but what you do already be plagued very often and never lose your temper
p01765_B,01765,B,thank you but there is no escaping these little vexations mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer perhaps on their very account their remoteness and unpunctuality or their exorbitant charges and frauds will be drawing forth bitter lamentations
p01766_B,01766,B,i mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of it certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it
p01767_B,01767,B,you intend to be very rich
p01768_B,01768,B,to be sure do not you do not we all
p01769_B,01769,B,i cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss crawford may chuse her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor
p01770_B,01770,B,by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connexions what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do anything for you or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means but i shall not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich
p01771_B,01771,B,your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am anxious for your not looking down on
p01772_B,01772,B,but i do look down upon it if it might have been higher i must look down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to distinction
p01773_B,01773,B,but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction
p01774_B,01774,B,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago
p01775_B,01775,B,that is not much to the purpose now and as to my being in parliament i believe i must wait till there is an especial assembly for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on no miss crawford there are distinctions which i should be miserable if i thought myself without any chance absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining but they are of a different character
p01776_B,01776,B,and you know what your dinner will be the turkey and i assure you a very fine one for my dear cook insists upon the turkey s being dressed to morrow
p01777_B,01777,B,very well very well all the better i am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house but miss price and mr edmund bertram i dare say would take their chance we none of us want to hear the bill of fare a friendly meeting and not a fine dinner is all we have in view a turkey or a goose or a leg of mutton or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us
p01778_B,01778,B,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p01779_B,01779,B,i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked fanny
p01780_B,01780,B,if you cannot do without me ma am
p01781_B,01781,B,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening
p01782_B,01782,B,to be sure so i shall
p01783_B,01783,B,suppose you take my father s opinion ma am
p01784_B,01784,B,that s well thought of so i will edmund i will ask sir thomas as soon as he comes in whether i can do without her
p01785_B,01785,B,as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by fanny that being the first invitation it should be accepted
p01786_B,01786,B,i do not know we will ask him but he will be very much surprised that mrs grant should ask fanny at all
p01787_B,01787,B,she will be late but what is your difficulty
p01788_B,01788,B,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her
p01789_B,01789,B,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p01790_B,01790,B,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence
p01791_B,01791,B,but can i do without her sir thomas
p01792_B,01792,B,indeed i think you may
p01793_B,01793,B,she always makes tea you know when my sister is not here
p01794_B,01794,B,your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home
p01795_B,01795,B,very well then fanny may go edmund
p01796_B,01796,B,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p01797_B,01797,B,thank you i am so glad
p01798_B,01798,B,yes ma am i should not think of anything else
p01799_B,01799,B,and if it should rain which i think exceedingly likely for i never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life you must manage as well as you can and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you i certainly do not go home to night and therefore the carriage will not be out on my account so you must make up your mind to what may happen and take your things accordingly
p01800_B,01800,B,my dear sir thomas fanny can walk
p01801_B,01801,B,walk my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year will twenty minutes after four suit you
p01802_B,01802,B,yes sir
p01803_B,01803,B,quite unnecessary a great deal too kind but edmund goes true it is upon edmund s account i observed he was hoarse on thursday night
p01804_B,01804,B,the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin s marriage i hope it is not too fine but i thought i ought to wear it as soon as i could and that i might not have such another opportunity all the winter i hope you do not think me too fine
p01805_B,01805,B,a woman can never be too fine while she is all in white no i see no finery about you nothing but what is perfectly proper your gown seems very pretty i like these glossy spots has not miss crawford a gown something the same heyday here s company here s a carriage who have they got to meet us tis crawford s crawford s barouche i protest there are his own two men pushing it back into its old quarters he is here of course this is quite a surprise fanny i shall be very glad to see him
p01806_B,01806,B,yes they have been there about a fortnight miss price have they not and julia is with them
p01807_B,01807,B,and mr yates i presume is not far off
p01808_B,01808,B,mr yates oh we hear nothing of mr yates i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to mansfield park do you miss price i think my friend julia knows better than to entertain her father with mr yates
p01809_B,01809,B,poor rushworth and his two and forty speeches nobody can ever forget them poor fellow i see him now his toil and his despair well i am much mistaken if his lovely maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her she is too good for him much too good you were mr rushworth s best friend your kindness and patience can never be forgotten your indefatigable patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied to mix up an understanding for him out of the superfluity of your own he might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness but i may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party it is as a dream a pleasant dream i shall always look back on our theatricals with exquisite pleasure there was such an interest such an animation such a spirit diffused everybody felt it we were all alive there was employment hope solicitude bustle for every hour of the day always some little objection some little doubt some little anxiety to be got over i never was happier
p01810_B,01810,B,never happier never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly oh what a corrupted mind
p01811_B,01811,B,as far as i am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough
p01812_B,01812,B,i believe you are right it was more pleasant than prudent we were getting too noisy
p01813_B,01813,B,those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss
p01814_B,01814,B,the most interesting in the world how to make money how to turn a good income into a better dr grant is giving bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon i find he takes orders in a few weeks they were at it in the dining parlour i am glad to hear bertram will be so well off he will have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with and earned without much trouble i apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger brother and as of course he will still live at home it will be all for his menus plaisirs and a sermon at christmas and easter i suppose will be the sum total of sacrifice
p01815_B,01815,B,nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather blank henry if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year
p01816_B,01816,B,perhaps i might but all that you know is entirely comparative birthright and habit must settle the business bertram is certainly well off for a cadet of even a baronet s family by the time he is four or five and twenty he will have seven hundred a year and nothing to do for it
p01817_B,01817,B,i shall keep clear of you crawford as long as i can for you would be more likely to disconcert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man
p01818_B,01818,B,will he not feel this no he can feel nothing as he ought
p01819_B,01819,B,to walk and ride with me to be sure
p01820_B,01820,B,not exactly though i shall be happy to do both but that would be exercise only to my body and i must take care of my mind besides that would be all recreation and indulgence without the wholesome alloy of labour and i do not like to eat the bread of idleness no my plan is to make fanny price in love with me
p01821_B,01821,B,fanny price nonsense no no you ought to be satisfied with her two cousins
p01822_B,01822,B,but i cannot be satisfied without fanny price without making a small hole in fanny price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modest not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has anything to express and then her air her manner her tout ensemble is so indescribably improved she must be grown two inches at least since october
p01823_B,01823,B,phoo phoo this is only because there were no tall women to compare her with and because she has got a new gown and you never saw her so well dressed before she is just what she was in october believe me the truth is that she was the only girl in company for you to notice and you must have a somebody i have always thought her pretty not strikingly pretty but pretty enough as people say a sort of beauty that grows on one her eyes should be darker but she has a sweet smile but as for this wonderful degree of improvement i am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having nobody else to look at and therefore if you do set about a flirtation with her you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and folly
p01824_B,01824,B,i do not quite know what to make of miss fanny i do not understand her i could not tell what she would be at yesterday what is her character is she solemn is she queer is she prudish why did she draw back and look so grave at me i could hardly get her to speak i never was so long in company with a girl in my life trying to entertain her and succeed so ill never met with a girl who looked so grave on me i must try to get the better of this her looks say i will not like you i am determined not to like you and i say she shall
p01825_B,01825,B,foolish fellow and so this is her attraction after all this it is her not caring about you which gives her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces i do desire that you will not be making her really unhappy a little love perhaps may animate and do her good but i will not have you plunge her deep for she is as good a little creature as ever lived and has a great deal of feeling
p01826_B,01826,B,it can be but for a fortnight and if a fortnight can kill her she must have a constitution which nothing could save no i will not do her any harm dear little soul i only want her to look kindly on me to give me smiles as well as blushes to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are and be all animation when i take it and talk to her to think as i think be interested in all my possessions and pleasures try to keep me longer at mansfield and feel when i go away that she shall be never happy again i want nothing more
p01827_B,01827,B,moderation itself i can have no scruples now well you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself for we are a great deal together
p01828_B,01828,B,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything
p01829_B,01829,B,dear me how disagreeable i wonder anybody can ever go to sea
p01830_B,01830,B,oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr crawford does all the rest
p01831_B,01831,B,bertram i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck for i never do wrong without gaining by it i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentleman s house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone s throw of the said knoll and church i found myself in short in thornton lacey
p01832_B,01832,B,it sounds like it but which way did you turn after passing sewell s farm
p01833_B,01833,B,i answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions though were i to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour you would never be able to prove that it was not thornton lacey for such it certainly was
p01834_B,01834,B,you inquired then
p01835_B,01835,B,no i never inquire but i told a man mending a hedge that it was thornton lacey and he agreed to it
p01836_B,01836,B,you have a good memory i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place well and how did you like what you saw
p01837_B,01837,B,very much indeed you are a lucky fellow there will be work for five summers at least before the place is liveable
p01838_B,01838,B,no no not so bad as that the farmyard must be moved i grant you but i am not aware of anything else the house is by no means bad and when the yard is removed there may be a very tolerable approach to it
p01839_B,01839,B,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas
p01840_B,01840,B,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me
p01841_B,01841,B,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p01842_B,01842,B,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p01843_B,01843,B,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p01844_B,01844,B,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p01845_B,01845,B,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered
p01846_B,01846,B,i should be very happy aunt but brighton is almost by beachey head and if i could get so far i could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that poor scrubby midshipman as i am
p01847_B,01847,B,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p01848_B,01848,B,i would rather find him private secretary to the first lord than anything else
p01849_B,01849,B,it is the only way sir in which i could not wish you established as a permanent neighbour but i hope and believe that edmund will occupy his own house at thornton lacey edmund am i saying too much
p01850_B,01850,B,we shall be the losers his going though only eight miles will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle but i should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less it is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject mr crawford but a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident and which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent edmund might in the common phrase do the duty of thornton that is he might read prayers and preach without giving up mansfield park he might ride over every sunday to a house nominally inhabited and go through divine service he might be the clergyman of thornton lacey every seventh day for three or four hours if that would content him but it will not he knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey and that if he does not live among his parishioners and prove himself by constant attention their well wisher and friend he does very little either for their good or his own i repeat again that thornton lacey is the only house in the neighbourhood in which i should not be happy to wait on mr crawford as occupier
p01851_B,01851,B,sir thomas undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest we must hope his son may prove that he knows it too
p01852_B,01852,B,but you do not wish yourself at portsmouth william
p01853_B,01853,B,no fanny that i do not i shall have enough of portsmouth and of dancing too when i cannot have you and i do not know that there would be any good in going to the assembly for i might not get a partner the portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a commission one might as well be nothing as a midshipman one is nothing indeed you remember the gregorys they are grown up amazing fine girls but they will hardly speak to me because lucy is courted by a lieutenant
p01854_B,01854,B,oh shame shame but never mind it william it is not worth minding it is no reflection on you it is no more than what the greatest admirals have all experienced more or less in their time you must think of that you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which fall to every sailor s share like bad weather and hard living only with this advantage that there will be an end to it that there will come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure when you are a lieutenant only think william when you are a lieutenant how little you will care for any nonsense of this kind
p01855_B,01855,B,i begin to think i shall never be a lieutenant fanny everybody gets made but me
p01856_B,01856,B,oh my dear william do not talk so do not be so desponding my uncle says nothing but i am sure he will do everything in his power to get you made he knows as well as you do of what consequence it is
p01857_B,01857,B,are you fond of dancing fanny
p01858_B,01858,B,yes very only i am soon tired
p01859_B,01859,B,i should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance have you never any balls at northampton i should like to see you dance and i d dance with you if you would for nobody would know who i was here and i should like to be your partner once more we used to jump about together many a time did not we when the hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good dancer in my way but i dare say you are a better is not fanny a very good dancer sir
p01860_B,01860,B,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p01861_B,01861,B,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p01862_B,01862,B,come fanny fanny what are you about we are going do not you see your aunt is going quick quick i cannot bear to keep good old wilcox waiting you should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and edmund and william
p01863_B,01863,B,i do not like william that you should leave northamptonshire without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at northampton your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue would be too much for your aunt i believe we must not think of a northampton ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if
p01864_B,01864,B,ah my dear sir thomas i knew what was coming i knew what you were going to say if dear julia were at home or dearest mrs rushworth at sotherton to afford a reason an occasion for such a thing you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at mansfield i know you would if they were at home to grace the ball a ball you would have this very christmas thank your uncle william thank your uncle
p01865_B,01865,B,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement
p01866_B,01866,B,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were
p01867_B,01867,B,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words
p01868_B,01868,B,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond
p01869_B,01869,B,if that is all you have to say fanny
p01870_B,01870,B,no no it is not i want to consult you oh this is beautiful indeed this is the very thing precisely what i wished for this is the only ornament i have ever had a desire to possess it will exactly suit my cross they must and shall be worn together it comes too in such an acceptable moment oh cousin you do not know how acceptable it is
p01871_B,01871,B,my dear fanny you feel these things a great deal too much i am most happy that you like the chain and that it should be here in time for to morrow but your thanks are far beyond the occasion believe me i have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to yours no i can safely say i have no pleasure so complete so unalloyed it is without a drawback but what is it that you want to consult me about return the necklace no my dear fanny upon no account it would be mortifying her severely there can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so deserving of
p01872_B,01872,B,if it had been given to me in the first instance i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with it when it is not wanted
p01873_B,01873,B,she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no difference for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to prevent you from keeping it no doubt it is handsomer than mine and fitter for a ballroom
p01874_B,01874,B,no it is not handsomer not at all handsomer in its way and for my purpose not half so fit the chain will agree with william s cross beyond all comparison better than the necklace
p01875_B,01875,B,for one night fanny for only one night if it be a sacrifice i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort miss crawford s attentions to you have been not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could be but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the necklace as you are engaged to do to morrow evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for commoner occasions this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences resulting principally from situation no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise between the two dearest objects i have on earth
p01876_B,01876,B,suppose i were to find him there again to day
p01877_B,01877,B,no i have not been out at all
p01878_B,01878,B,then you have had fatigues within doors which are worse you had better have gone out i come from dr grant s you may guess my errand there fanny i wished to engage miss crawford for the two first dances yes she is engaged to me but she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me she is not serious i think i hope i am sure she is not serious but i would rather not hear it she never has danced with a clergyman she says and she never will for my own sake i could wish there had been no ball just at i mean not this very week this very day to morrow i leave home
p01879_B,01879,B,i am very sorry that anything has occurred to distress you this ought to be a day of pleasure my uncle meant it so
p01880_B,01880,B,oh yes yes and it will be a day of pleasure it will all end right i am only vexed for a moment in fact it is not that i consider the ball as ill timed what does it signify but fanny you know what all this means you see how it is and could tell me perhaps better than i could tell you how and why i am vexed let me talk to you a little you are a kind kind listener i have been pained by her manner this morning and cannot get the better of it i know her disposition to be as sweet and faultless as your own but the influence of her former companions makes her seem gives to her conversation to her professed opinions sometimes a tinge of wrong she does not think evil but she speaks it speaks it in playfulness and though i know it to be playfulness it grieves me to the soul
p01881_B,01881,B,the effect of education
p01882_B,01882,B,yes that uncle and aunt they have injured the finest mind for sometimes fanny i own to you it does appear more than manner it appears as if the mind itself was tainted
p01883_B,01883,B,if you only want me as a listener cousin i will be as useful as i can but i am not qualified for an adviser do not ask advice of me i am not competent
p01884_B,01884,B,you are right fanny to protest against such an office but you need not be afraid it is a subject on which i should never ask advice it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked and few i imagine do ask it but when they want to be influenced against their conscience i only want to talk to you
p01885_B,01885,B,one thing more excuse the liberty but take care how you talk to me do not tell me anything now which hereafter you may be sorry for the time may come
p01886_B,01886,B,dearest fanny you are all considerate thought but it is unnecessary here the time will never come no such time as you allude to will ever come i begin to think it most improbable the chances grow less and less and even if it should there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of for i can never be ashamed of my own scruples and if they are removed it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the faults she once had you are the only being upon earth to whom i should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her you can bear me witness fanny that i have never been blinded how many a time have we talked over her little errors you need not fear me i have almost given up every serious idea of her but i must be a blockhead indeed if whatever befell me i could think of your kindness and sympathy without the sincerest gratitude
p01887_B,01887,B,yes cousin i am convinced that you would be incapable of anything else though perhaps some might not i cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say do not check yourself tell me whatever you like
p01888_B,01888,B,look well oh yes she has good reason to look well with all her advantages brought up in this family as she has been with all the benefit of her cousins manners before her only think my dear sir thomas what extraordinary advantages you and i have been the means of giving her the very gown you have been taking notice of is your own generous present to her when dear mrs rushworth married what would she have been if we had not taken her by the hand
p01889_B,01889,B,ah ma am how much we want dear mrs rushworth and julia to night
p01890_B,01890,B,so soon my good friend it is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours
p01891_B,01891,B,well then fanny you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me
p01892_B,01892,B,oh william
p01893_B,01893,B,what did she think of being up before you set off
p01894_B,01894,B,oh yes sir i must get up and breakfast with him it will be the last time you know the last morning
p01895_B,01895,B,you had better not he is to have breakfasted and be gone by half past nine mr crawford i think you call for him at half past nine
p01896_B,01896,B,yes half past nine and i shall be punctual for there will be no kind sister to get up for me
p01897_B,01897,B,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p01898_B,01898,B,we miss our two young men and there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to edmund we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done
p01899_B,01899,B,yes but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home sir thomas i have been thinking and i am very glad we took fanny as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it
p01900_B,01900,B,very true we shew fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her face she is now a very valuable companion if we have been kind to her she is now quite as necessary to us
p01901_B,01901,B,yes and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her
p01902_B,01902,B,she will never leave us i hope till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here
p01903_B,01903,B,and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at sotherton now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there and i am sure she is better off here and besides i cannot do without her
p01904_B,01904,B,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it
p01905_B,01905,B,perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of it is the general way all young men do
p01906_B,01906,B,he did not the only time he went to see mr owen before
p01907_B,01907,B,he finds the house more agreeable now he is a very a very pleasing young man himself and i cannot help being rather concerned at not seeing him again before i go to london as will now undoubtedly be the case i am looking for henry every day and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at mansfield i should like to have seen him once more i confess but you must give my compliments to him yes i think it must be compliments is not there a something wanted miss price in our language a something between compliments and and love to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together so many months acquaintance but compliments may be sufficient here was his letter a long one does he give you much account of what he is doing is it christmas gaieties that he is staying for
p01908_B,01908,B,i only heard a part of the letter it was to my uncle but i believe it was very short indeed i am sure it was but a few lines all that i heard was that his friend had pressed him to stay longer and that he had agreed to do so a few days longer or some days longer i am not quite sure which
p01909_B,01909,B,oh if he wrote to his father but i thought it might have been to lady bertram or you but if he wrote to his father no wonder he was concise who could write chat to sir thomas if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have heard of balls and parties he would have sent you a description of everything and everybody how many miss owens are there
p01910_B,01910,B,three grown up
p01911_B,01911,B,are they musical
p01912_B,01912,B,i do not at all know i never heard
p01913_B,01913,B,that is the first question you know which every woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are all very accomplished and pleasing and one very pretty there is a beauty in every family it is a regular thing two play on the pianoforte and one on the harp and all sing or would sing if they were taught or sing all the better for not being taught or something like it
p01914_B,01914,B,i know nothing of the miss owens
p01915_B,01915,B,you know nothing and you care less as people say never did tone express indifference plainer indeed how can one care for those one has never seen well when your cousin comes back he will find mansfield very quiet all the noisy ones gone your brother and mine and myself i do not like the idea of leaving mrs grant now the time draws near she does not like my going
p01916_B,01916,B,you cannot doubt your being missed by many you will be very much missed
p01917_B,01917,B,oh yes missed as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away that is there is a great difference felt but i am not fishing don t compliment me if i am missed it will appear i may be discovered by those who want to see me i shall not be in any doubtful or distant or unapproachable region the miss owens suppose you were to have one of the miss owens settled at thornton lacey how should you like it stranger things have happened i dare say they are trying for it and they are quite in the right for it would be a very pretty establishment for them i do not at all wonder or blame them it is everybody s duty to do as well for themselves as they can sir thomas bertram s son is somebody and now he is in their own line their father is a clergyman and their brother is a clergyman and they are all clergymen together he is their lawful property he fairly belongs to them you don t speak fanny miss price you don t speak but honestly now do not you rather expect it than otherwise
p01918_B,01918,B,no i do not expect it at all
p01919_B,01919,B,not at all i wonder at that but i dare say you know exactly i always imagine you are perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at all or not at present
p01920_B,01920,B,no i do not
p01921_B,01921,B,he is best off as he is
p01922_B,01922,B,yes mary i could not get away sooner fanny looked so lovely i am quite determined mary my mind is entirely made up will it astonish you no you must be aware that i am quite determined to marry fanny price yes mary i am fairly caught you know with what idle designs i began but this is the end of them i have i flatter myself made no inconsiderable progress in her affections but my own are entirely fixed
p01923_B,01923,B,lucky lucky girl what a match for her my dearest henry this must be my first feeling but my second which you shall have as sincerely is that i approve your choice from my soul and foresee your happiness as heartily as i wish and desire it you will have a sweet little wife all gratitude and devotion exactly what you deserve what an amazing match for her mrs norris often talks of her luck what will she say now the delight of all the family indeed and she has some true friends in it how they will rejoice but tell me all about it talk to me for ever when did you begin to think seriously about her ah my dear henry and this is what took you to london this was your business you chose to consult the admiral before you made up your mind
p01924_B,01924,B,when fanny is known to him he will doat on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled settled beyond all interference he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet
p01925_B,01925,B,well well i am satisfied i know now to whom it must relate and am in no hurry for the rest fanny price wonderful quite wonderful that mansfield should have done so much for that you should have found your fate in mansfield but you are quite right you could not have chosen better there is not a better girl in the world and you do not want for fortune and as to her connexions they are more than good the bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country she is niece to sir thomas bertram that will be enough for the world but go on go on tell me more what are your plans does she know her own happiness
p01926_B,01926,B,for for very little more than opportunity mary she is not like her cousins but i think i shall not ask in vain
p01927_B,01927,B,oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure her all your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse
p01928_B,01928,B,i could so wholly and absolutely confide in her and that is what i want
p01929_B,01929,B,the more i think of it the more am i convinced that you are doing quite right and though i should never have selected fanny price as the girl most likely to attach you i am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed you will both find your good in it
p01930_B,01930,B,it was bad very bad in me against such a creature but i did not know her then and she shall have no reason to lament the hour that first put it into my head i will make her very happy mary happier than she has ever yet been herself or ever seen anybody else i will not take her from northamptonshire i shall let everingham and rent a place in this neighbourhood perhaps stanwix lodge i shall let a seven years lease of everingham i am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word i could name three people now who would give me my own terms and thank me
p01931_B,01931,B,ha settle in northamptonshire that is pleasant then we shall be all together
p01932_B,01932,B,you must give us more than half your time i cannot admit mrs grant to have an equal claim with fanny and myself for we shall both have a right in you fanny will be so truly your sister
p01933_B,01933,B,you will divide your year between london and northamptonshire
p01934_B,01934,B,well well we do not think quite alike here the admiral has his faults but he is a very good man and has been more than a father to me few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much you must not prejudice fanny against him i must have them love one another
p01935_B,01935,B,henry i think so highly of fanny price that if i could suppose the next mrs crawford would have half the reason which my poor ill used aunt had to abhor the very name i would prevent the marriage if possible but i know you i know that a wife you loved would be the happiest of women and that even when you ceased to love she would yet find in you the liberality and good breeding of a gentleman
p01936_B,01936,B,had you seen her this morning mary attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her aunt s stupidity working with her and for her her colour beautifully heightened as she leant over the work then returning to her seat to finish a note which she was previously engaged in writing for that stupid woman s service and all this with such unpretending gentleness so much as if it were a matter of course that she was not to have a moment at her own command her hair arranged as neatly as it always is and one little curl falling forward as she wrote which she now and then shook back and in the midst of all this still speaking at intervals to me or listening and as if she liked to listen to what i said had you seen her so mary you would not have implied the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing
p01937_B,01937,B,my dearest henry how glad i am to see you so much in love it quite delights me but what will mrs rushworth and julia say
p01938_B,01938,B,i care neither what they say nor what they feel they will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me that can attach a man of sense i wish the discovery may do them any good and they will now see their cousin treated as she ought to be and i wish they may be heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness they will be angry mrs rushworth will be very angry it will be a bitter pill to her that is like other bitter pills it will have two moments ill flavour and then be swallowed and forgotten for i am not such a coxcomb as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women s though i was the object of them yes mary my fanny will feel a difference indeed a daily hourly difference in the behaviour of every being who approaches her and it will be the completion of my happiness to know that i am the doer of it that i am the person to give the consequence so justly her due now she is dependent helpless friendless neglected forgotten
p01939_B,01939,B,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her
p01940_B,01940,B,edmund true i believe he is generally speaking kind to her and so is sir thomas in his way but it is the way of a rich superior long worded arbitrary uncle what can sir thomas and edmund together do what do they do for her happiness comfort honour and dignity in the world to what i shall do
p01941_B,01941,B,has this been all your doing then good heaven how very very kind have you really was it by your desire i beg your pardon but i am bewildered did admiral crawford apply how was it i am stupefied how kind how very kind oh mr crawford we are infinitely obliged to you dearest dearest william i will go to my uncle my uncle ought to know it as soon as possible don t mr crawford pray don t i beg you would not this is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me i must go away i cannot bear it no no no this is all nonsense do not distress me i can hear no more of this your kindness to william makes me more obliged to you than words can express but i do not want i cannot bear i must not listen to such no no don t think of me but you are not thinking of me i know it is all nothing
p01942_B,01942,B,i am glad you gave him something considerable for i gave him only 10
p01943_B,01943,B,indeed upon my word he must have gone off with his pockets well lined and at no expense for his journey to london either
p01944_B,01944,B,sir thomas told me 10 would be enough
p01945_B,01945,B,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them
p01946_B,01946,B,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny
p01947_B,01947,B,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line
p01948_B,01948,B,oh yes certainly i will write directly
p01949_B,01949,B,you cannot think i mean to hurry you you cannot think i have any such object do not hurry yourself i entreat
p01950_B,01950,B,oh i thank you i have quite done just done it will be ready in a moment i am very much obliged to you if you will be so good as to give that to miss crawford
p01951_B,01951,B,i am not cold sir i never sit here long at this time of year
p01952_B,01952,B,but you have a fire in general
p01953_B,01953,B,no sir
p01954_B,01954,B,how comes this about here must be some mistake i understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable in your bedchamber i know you cannot have a fire here is some great misapprehension which must be rectified it is highly unfit for you to sit be it only half an hour a day without a fire you are not strong you are chilly your aunt cannot be aware of this i understand i understand your aunt norris has always been an advocate and very judiciously for young people s being brought up without unnecessary indulgences but there should be moderation in everything she is also very hardy herself which of course will influence her in her opinion of the wants of others and on another account too i can perfectly comprehend i know what her sentiments have always been the principle was good in itself but it may have been and i believe has been carried too far in your case i am aware that there has been sometimes in some points a misplaced distinction but i think too well of you fanny to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on that account you have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part and judging partially by the event you will take in the whole of the past you will consider times persons and probabilities and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you for that mediocrity of condition which seemed to be your lot though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary it was kindly meant and of this you may be assured that every advantage of affluence will be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been imposed i am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you by failing at any time to treat your aunt norris with the respect and attention that are due to her but enough of this sit down my dear i must speak to you for a few minutes but i will not detain you long you are not aware perhaps that i have had a visitor this morning i had not been long in my own room after breakfast when mr crawford was shewn in his errand you may probably conjecture and now fanny having performed one part of my commission and shewn you everything placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory i may execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs where though i cannot but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself i must submit to your finding one still better worth listening to mr crawford as you have perhaps foreseen is yet in the house he is in my room and hoping to see you there
p01955_B,01955,B,oh no sir i cannot indeed i cannot go down to him mr crawford ought to know he must know that i told him enough yesterday to convince him he spoke to me on this subject yesterday and i told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me and quite out of my power to return his good opinion
p01956_B,01956,B,i do not catch your meaning out of your power to return his good opinion what is all this i know he spoke to you yesterday and as far as i understand received as much encouragement to proceed as a well judging young woman could permit herself to give i was very much pleased with what i collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion it shewed a discretion highly to be commended but now when he has made his overtures so properly and honourably what are your scruples now
p01957_B,01957,B,you are mistaken sir you are quite mistaken how could mr crawford say such a thing i gave him no encouragement yesterday on the contrary i told him i cannot recollect my exact words but i am sure i told him that i would not listen to him that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect and that i begged him never to talk to me in that manner again i am sure i said as much as that and more and i should have said still more if i had been quite certain of his meaning anything seriously but i did not like to be i could not bear to be imputing more than might be intended i thought it might all pass for nothing with him
p01958_B,01958,B,am i to understand that you mean to refuse mr crawford
p01959_B,01959,B,yes sir
p01960_B,01960,B,refuse him
p01961_B,01961,B,yes sir
p01962_B,01962,B,refuse mr crawford upon what plea for what reason
p01963_B,01963,B,i i cannot like him sir well enough to marry him
p01964_B,01964,B,this is very strange there is something in this which my comprehension does not reach here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you with everything to recommend him not merely situation in life fortune and character but with more than common agreeableness with address and conversation pleasing to everybody and he is not an acquaintance of to day you have now known him some time his sister moreover is your intimate friend and he has been doing that for your brother which i should suppose would have been almost sufficient recommendation to you had there been no other it is very uncertain when my interest might have got william on he has done it already
p01965_B,01965,B,oh yes sir indeed i do his attentions were always what i did not like
p01966_B,01966,B,this is beyond me this requires explanation young as you are and having seen scarcely any one it is hardly possible that your affections no no i know that is quite out of the question quite impossible well there is nothing more to be said independently of the interest which mr crawford s choice seemed to justify his wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me i am an advocate for early marriages where there are means in proportion and would have every young man with a sufficient income settle as soon after four and twenty as he can this is so much my opinion that i am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son your cousin mr bertram is to marry early but at present as far as i can judge matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts i wish he were more likely to fix edmund i consider from his dispositions and habits as much more likely to marry early than his brother he indeed i have lately thought has seen the woman he could love which i am convinced my eldest son has not am i right do you agree with me my dear
p01967_B,01967,B,yes sir
p01968_B,01968,B,have you any reason child to think ill of mr crawford s temper
p01969_B,01969,B,no sir
p01970_B,01970,B,it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most mortifying conference mr crawford must not be kept longer waiting i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had fanny as i think my behaviour must have shewn formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my return to england i had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which prevails so much in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence but you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you without even asking their advice you have shewn yourself very very different from anything that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family of your parents your brothers and sisters never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they might be benefited how they must rejoice in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr crawford exactly what a young heated fancy imagines to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations and are in a wild fit of folly throwing away from you such an opportunity of being settled in life eligibly honourably nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you fanny that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr crawford s estate or a tenth part of his merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr crawford sought julia s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rushworth and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it only half the eligibility of this immediately and peremptorily and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross violation of duty and respect you are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but fanny if your heart can acquit you of ingratitude
p01971_B,01971,B,i am very sorry i am very sorry indeed
p01972_B,01972,B,sorry yes i hope you are sorry and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day s transactions
p01973_B,01973,B,if it were possible for me to do otherwise but i am so perfectly convinced that i could never make him happy and that i should be miserable myself
p01974_B,01974,B,well well child dry up your tears there is no use in these tears they can do no good you must now come downstairs with me mr crawford has been kept waiting too long already you must give him your own answer we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less and you only can explain to him the grounds of that misconception of your sentiments which unfortunately for himself he certainly has imbibed i am totally unequal to it mr crawford is gone he has just left me i need not repeat what has passed i do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling by an account of what he has felt suffice it that he has behaved in the most gentlemanlike and generous manner and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding heart and temper upon my representation of what you were suffering he immediately and with the greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see you for the present of course it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone be it only for five minutes a request too natural a claim too just to be denied but there is no time fixed perhaps to morrow or whenever your spirits are composed enough for the present you have only to tranquillise yourself check these tears they do but exhaust you if as i am willing to suppose you wish to shew me any observance you will not give way to these emotions but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind i advise you to go out the air will do you good go out for an hour on the gravel you will have the shrubbery to yourself and will be the better for air and exercise and fanny i shall make no mention below of what has passed i shall not even tell your aunt bertram there is no occasion for spreading the disappointment say nothing about it yourself
p01975_B,01975,B,i must be a brute indeed if i can be really ungrateful heaven defend me from being ungrateful
p01976_B,01976,B,i recommended the shrubbery to fanny as the driest place
p01977_B,01977,B,oh that was very kind of you sir thomas but you do not know how dry the path is to my house fanny would have had quite as good a walk there i assure you with the advantage of being of some use and obliging her aunt it is all her fault if she would but have let us know she was going out but there is a something about fanny i have often observed it before she likes to go her own way to work she does not like to be dictated to she takes her own independent walk whenever she can she certainly has a little spirit of secrecy and independence and nonsense about her which i would advise her to get the better of
p01978_B,01978,B,stay stay fanny what are you about where are you going don t be in such a hurry depend upon it it is not you who are wanted depend upon it it is me but you are so very eager to put yourself forward what should sir thomas want you for it is me baddeley you mean i am coming this moment you mean me baddeley i am sure sir thomas wants me not miss price
p01979_B,01979,B,no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price
p01980_B,01980,B,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power
p01981_B,01981,B,my dear there is no occasion for this your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to be said or done from this hour the subject is never to be revived between us you will have nothing to fear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations your happiness and advantage are all that i have in view and nothing is required of you but to bear with mr crawford s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his he proceeds at his own risk you are on safe ground i have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred you will see him with the rest of us in the same manner and as much as you can dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant he leaves northamptonshire so soon that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded the future must be very uncertain and now my dear fanny this subject is closed between us
p01982_B,01982,B,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p01983_B,01983,B,no my dear i should not think of missing you when such an offer as this comes in your way i could do very well without you if you were married to a man of such good estate as mr crawford and you must be aware fanny that it is every young woman s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this i will tell you what fanny i am sure he fell in love with you at the ball i am sure the mischief was done that evening you did look remarkably well everybody said so sir thomas said so and you know you had chapman to help you to dress i am very glad i sent chapman to you i shall tell sir thomas that i am sure it was done that evening and i will tell you what fanny which is more than i did for maria the next time pug has a litter you shall have a puppy
p01984_B,01984,B,let me have the pleasure of finishing that speech to your ladyship i shall find it immediately
p01985_B,01985,B,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well
p01986_B,01986,B,it will be a favourite i believe from this hour but i do not think i have had a volume of shakespeare in my hand before since i was fifteen i once saw henry the eighth acted or i have heard of it from somebody who did i am not certain which but shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how it is a part of an englishman s constitution his thoughts and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches them everywhere one is intimate with him by instinct no man of any brain can open at a good part of one of his plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately
p01987_B,01987,B,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent
p01988_B,01988,B,sir you do me honour
p01989_B,01989,B,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p01990_B,01990,B,do you ma am no no that will never be your ladyship is quite mistaken no theatre at everingham oh no
p01991_B,01991,B,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p01992_B,01992,B,our liturgy has beauties which not even a careless slovenly style of reading can destroy but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt for myself at least i must confess being not always so attentive as i ought to be that nineteen times out of twenty i am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read and longing to have it to read myself did you speak
p01993_B,01993,B,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing
p01994_B,01994,B,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy
p01995_B,01995,B,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can
p01996_B,01996,B,do i astonish you do you wonder is there anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand i will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner all that gives me an interest in what you look and do and excites my present curiosity i will not leave you to wonder long you shook your head at my acknowledging that i should not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy yes that was the word constancy i am not afraid of the word i would spell it read it write it with anybody i see nothing alarming in the word did you think i ought
p01997_B,01997,B,perhaps sir perhaps sir i thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment
p01998_B,01998,B,well i am happier than i was because i now understand more clearly your opinion of me you think me unsteady easily swayed by the whim of the moment easily tempted easily put aside with such an opinion no wonder that but we shall see it is not by protestations that i shall endeavour to convince you i am wronged it is not by telling you that my affections are steady my conduct shall speak for me absence distance time shall speak for me they shall prove that as far as you can be deserved by anybody i do deserve you you are infinitely my superior in merit all that i know you have qualities which i had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in any human creature you have some touches of the angel in you beyond what not merely beyond what one sees because one never sees anything like it but beyond what one fancies might be but still i am not frightened it is not by equality of merit that you can be won that is out of the question it is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest who loves you most devotedly that has the best right to a return there i build my confidence by that right i do and will deserve you and when once convinced that my attachment is what i declare it i know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes yes dearest sweetest fanny nay forgive me perhaps i have as yet no right but by what other name can i call you do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under any other no it is fanny that i think of all day and dream of all night you have given the name such reality of sweetness that nothing else can now be descriptive of you
p01999_B,01999,B,if you hear of it from everybody cousin there can be nothing for me to tell
p02000_B,02000,B,not of facts perhaps but of feelings fanny no one but you can tell me them i do not mean to press you however if it is not what you wish yourself i have done i had thought it might be a relief
p02001_B,02001,B,i am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in talking of what i feel
p02002_B,02002,B,do you suppose that we think differently i have no idea of it i dare say that on a comparison of our opinions they would be found as much alike as they have been used to be to the point i consider crawford s proposals as most advantageous and desirable if you could return his affection i consider it as most natural that all your family should wish you could return it but that as you cannot you have done exactly as you ought in refusing him can there be any disagreement between us here
p02003_B,02003,B,oh no but i thought you blamed me i thought you were against me this is such a comfort
p02004_B,02004,B,this comfort you might have had sooner fanny had you sought it but how could you possibly suppose me against you how could you imagine me an advocate for marriage without love were i even careless in general on such matters how could you imagine me so where your happiness was at stake
p02005_B,02005,B,my uncle thought me wrong and i knew he had been talking to you
p02006_B,02006,B,as far as you have gone fanny i think you perfectly right i may be sorry i may be surprised though hardly that for you had not had time to attach yourself but i think you perfectly right can it admit of a question it is disgraceful to us if it does you did not love him nothing could have justified your accepting him so far your conduct has been faultless and they were quite mistaken who wished you to do otherwise but the matter does not end here crawford s is no common attachment he perseveres with the hope of creating that regard which had not been created before this we know must be a work of time but let him succeed at last fanny let him succeed at last you have proved yourself upright and disinterested prove yourself grateful and tender hearted and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which i have always believed you born for
p02007_B,02007,B,oh never never never he never will succeed with me
p02008_B,02008,B,never fanny so very determined and positive this is not like yourself your rational self
p02009_B,02009,B,i mean that i think i never shall as far as the future can be answered for i think i never shall return his regard
p02010_B,02010,B,i must hope better things i am aware more aware than crawford can be that the man who means to make you love him you having due notice of his intentions must have very uphill work for there are all your early attachments and habits in battle array and before he can get your heart for his own use he has to unfasten it from all the holds upon things animate and inanimate which so many years growth have confirmed and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the very idea of separation i know that the apprehension of being forced to quit mansfield will for a time be arming you against him i wish he had not been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do fanny between us i think we should have won you my theoretical and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as i firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not the wish to love him the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference
p02011_B,02011,B,we are so totally unlike we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if i could like him there never were two people more dissimilar we have not one taste in common we should be miserable
p02012_B,02012,B,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct
p02013_B,02013,B,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over
p02014_B,02014,B,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open
p02015_B,02015,B,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous
p02016_B,02016,B,very possibly no wonder nothing could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest
p02017_B,02017,B,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions
p02018_B,02018,B,julia i have heard before from some one of his being in love with julia but i could never see anything of it and fanny though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by crawford and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encouragement a man like crawford lively and it may be a little unthinking might be led on to there could be nothing very striking because it is clear that he had no pretensions his heart was reserved for you and i must say that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him unspoilt by his uncle it proves him in short everything that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not
p02019_B,02019,B,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects
p02020_B,02020,B,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything
p02021_B,02021,B,i would not engage in such a charge in such an office of high responsibility
p02022_B,02022,B,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity
p02023_B,02023,B,was mrs grant in the room then
p02024_B,02024,B,yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you fanny till crawford and dr grant came in
p02025_B,02025,B,it is above a week since i saw miss crawford
p02026_B,02026,B,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart
p02027_B,02027,B,i knew she would be very angry with me
p02028_B,02028,B,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality
p02029_B,02029,B,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time
p02030_B,02030,B,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me
p02031_B,02031,B,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply
p02032_B,02032,B,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life
p02033_B,02033,B,you were near staying there
p02034_B,02034,B,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough
p02035_B,02035,B,you spent your time pleasantly there
p02036_B,02036,B,yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if i did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in mansfield again
p02037_B,02037,B,the miss owens you liked them did not you
p02038_B,02038,B,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice
p02039_B,02039,B,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend
p02040_B,02040,B,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it perfectly
p02041_B,02041,B,do you mean then that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand oh miss crawford that was not fair
p02042_B,02042,B,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes
p02043_B,02043,B,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing
p02044_B,02044,B,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph
p02045_B,02045,B,i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander by can judge of
p02046_B,02046,B,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission
p02047_B,02047,B,oh yes how very very kind of him
p02048_B,02048,B,i know he must have exerted himself very much for i know the parties he had to move the admiral hates trouble and scorns asking favours and there are so many young men s claims to be attended to in the same way that a friendship and energy not very determined is easily put by what a happy creature william must be i wish we could see him i should like to sit talking with you here all day but we must not forget the ladies below and so good bye my dear my amiable my excellent fanny for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast parlour i must take leave of you here and i do take leave longing for a happy reunion and trusting that when we meet again it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve i shall see your cousin in town soon he talks of being there tolerably soon and sir thomas i dare say in the course of the spring and your eldest cousin and the rushworths and julia i am sure of meeting again and again and all but you i have two favours to ask fanny one is your correspondence you must write to me and the other that you will often call on mrs grant and make her amends for my being gone
p02049_B,02049,B,you are just in time we have been looking for you this half hour the thrush went out of harbour this morning i saw her it was a beautiful sight and they think she will have her orders in a day or two and mr campbell was here at four o clock to ask for you he has got one of the thrush s boats and is going off to her at six and hoped you would be here in time to go with him
p02050_B,02050,B,to be sure i had much rather she had stayed in harbour that i might have sat a few hours with you in comfort but as there is a boat ashore i had better go off at once and there is no help for it whereabouts does the thrush lay at spithead near the canopus but no matter here s fanny in the parlour and why should we stay in the passage come mother you have hardly looked at your own dear fanny yet
p02051_B,02051,B,poor dears how tired you must both be and now what will you have i began to think you would never come betsey and i have been watching for you this half hour and when did you get anything to eat and what would you like to have now i could not tell whether you would be for some meat or only a dish of tea after your journey or else i would have got something ready and now i am afraid campbell will be here before there is time to dress a steak and we have no butcher at hand it is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street we were better off in our last house perhaps you would like some tea as soon as it can be got then betsey my dear run into the kitchen and see if rebecca has put the water on and tell her to bring in the tea things as soon as she can i wish we could get the bell mended but betsey is a very handy little messenger dear me what a sad fire we have got and i dare say you are both starved with cold draw your chair nearer my dear i cannot think what rebecca has been about i am sure i told her to bring some coals half an hour ago susan you should have taken care of the fire
p02052_B,02052,B,i was upstairs mama moving my things you know you had but just settled that my sister fanny and i should have the other room and i could not get rebecca to give me any help
p02053_B,02053,B,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p02054_B,02054,B,devil take those young dogs how they are singing out ay sam s voice louder than all the rest that boy is fit for a boatswain holla you there sam stop your confounded pipe or i shall be after you
p02055_B,02055,B,what have you got there my love come and shew it to me
p02056_B,02056,B,now susan you have not the luck of such a good godmother aunt norris lives too far off to think of such little people as you now how can you be so cross you are always quarrelling about that knife i wish you would not be so quarrelsome poor little betsey how cross susan is to you but you should not have taken it out my dear when i sent you to the drawer you know i told you not to touch it because susan is so cross about it i must hide it another time betsey poor mary little thought it would be such a bone of contention when she gave it me to keep only two hours before she died poor little soul she could but just speak to be heard and she said so prettily poor little dear she was so fond of it fanny that she would have it lay by her in bed all through her illness it was the gift of her good godmother old mrs admiral maxwell only six weeks before she was taken for death poor little sweet creature well she was taken away from evil to come my own betsey
p02057_B,02057,B,mansfield sotherton thornton lacey what a society will be comprised in those houses and at michaelmas perhaps a fourth may be added some small hunting box in the vicinity of everything so dear for as to any partnership in thornton lacey as edmund bertram once good humouredly proposed i hope i foresee two objections two fair excellent irresistible objections to that plan
p02058_B,02058,B,no not quite a month it is only four weeks to morrow since i left mansfield
p02059_B,02059,B,you are a most accurate and honest reckoner i should call that a month
p02060_B,02060,B,i did not arrive here till tuesday evening
p02061_B,02061,B,and it is to be a two months visit is not
p02062_B,02062,B,yes my uncle talked of two months i suppose it will not be less
p02063_B,02063,B,and how are you to be conveyed back again who comes for you
p02064_B,02064,B,i do not know i have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt perhaps i may be to stay longer it may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months end
p02065_B,02065,B,i know mansfield i know its way i know its faults towards you i know the danger of your being so far forgotten as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family i am aware that you may be left here week after week if sir thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself or sending your aunt s maid for you without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year this will not do two months is an ample allowance i should think six weeks quite enough i am considering your sister s health which i think the confinement of portsmouth unfavourable to she requires constant air and exercise when you know her as well as i do i am sure you will agree that she does and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country if therefore you find yourself growing unwell and any difficulties arise about your returning to mansfield without waiting for the two months to be ended that must not be regarded as of any consequence if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual and will only let my sister know it give her only the slightest hint she and i will immediately come down and take you back to mansfield you know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done you know all that would be felt on the occasion i am perfectly serious as you perfectly know and i hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition indeed you shall not it shall not be in your power for so long only as you positively say in every letter to mary i am well and i know you cannot speak or write a falsehood so long only shall you be considered as well
p02066_B,02066,B,i advise you know very well what is right
p02067_B,02067,B,yes when you give me your opinion i always know what is right your judgment is my rule of right
p02068_B,02068,B,oh no do not say so we have all a better guide in ourselves if we would attend to it than any other person can be good bye i wish you a pleasant journey to morrow
p02069_B,02069,B,is there nothing i can do for you in town
p02070_B,02070,B,nothing i am much obliged to you
p02071_B,02071,B,have you no message for anybody
p02072_B,02072,B,my love to your sister if you please and when you see my cousin my cousin edmund i wish you would be so good as to say that i suppose i shall soon hear from him
p02073_B,02073,B,certainly and if he is lazy or negligent i will write his excuses myself
p02074_B,02074,B,i never will no i certainly never will wish for a letter again what do they bring but disappointment and sorrow not till after easter how shall i bear it and my poor aunt talking of me every hour there is no good in this delay why is not it settled he is blinded and nothing will open his eyes nothing can after having had truths before him so long in vain he will marry her and be poor and miserable god grant that her influence do not make him cease to be respectable i firmly believe it it is an attachment to govern his whole life accepted or refused his heart is wedded to her for ever edmund you do not know me the families would never be connected if you did not connect them oh write write finish it at once let there be an end of this suspense fix commit condemn yourself tis nonsense all she loves nobody but herself and her brother her friends leading her astray for years she is quite as likely to have led them astray they have all perhaps been corrupting one another but if they are so much fonder of her than she is of them she is the less likely to have been hurt except by their flattery
p02075_B,02075,B,rushworth sir
p02076_B,02076,B,and don t they live in wimpole street
p02077_B,02077,B,yes sir
p02078_B,02078,B,then there s the devil to pay among them that s all there much good may such fine relations do you i don t know what sir thomas may think of such matters he may be too much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less but by g if she belonged to me i d give her the rope s end as long as i could stand over her a little flogging for man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things
p02079_B,02079,B,it is a mistake sir it must be a mistake it cannot be true it must mean some other people
p02080_B,02080,B,it might be all a lie but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays that way that there was no answering for anybody
p02081_B,02081,B,indeed i hope it is not true it would be so very shocking if i have spoken once to rebecca about that carpet i am sure i have spoke at least a dozen times have not i betsey and it would not be ten minutes work
p02082_B,02082,B,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty
p02083_B,02083,B,nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on began to talk of you yes then she began to talk of you regretting as well she might the loss of such a there she spoke very rationally but she has always done justice to you said she my dearest fanny i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might have been but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent if you do give me but a look a word and i have done thank god now fanny she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty to the lessons of affliction and immediately left the room i had gone a few steps fanny when i heard the door open behind me said she i looked back said she with a smile but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a saucy playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since sometimes for a moment regretted that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived equally in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience fanny this has been the greatest relief and now we will have done we were all disposed to wonder but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no guile should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise and warm affection yet even here there was alloy a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim could you have believed it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened cruelty do you call it we differ there no hers is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance unsuspiciousness of there being such feelings in a perversion of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined everybody else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would hers are faults of principle fanny of blunted delicacy and a corrupted vitiated mind perhaps it is best for me since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so
p02084_B,02084,B,did you
p02085_B,02085,B,yes when i left her i told her so
p02086_B,02086,B,how long were you together
p02087_B,02087,B,five and twenty minutes well she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them she spoke of it fanny with a steadier voice than i can said she i shall soon have done i have told you the substance of all that she said as soon as i could speak i replied that i had not supposed it possible coming in such a state of mind into that house as i had done that anything could occur to make me suffer more but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence that though i had in the course of our acquaintance been often sensible of some difference in our opinions on points too of some moment it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it that the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister with whom lay the greater seduction i pretended not to say but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself giving it every reproach but the right considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong and last of all and above all recommending to us a compliance a compromise an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin on the chance of a marriage which thinking as i now thought of her brother should rather be prevented than sought all this together most grievously convinced me that i had never understood her before and that as far as related to mind it had been the creature of my own imagination not miss crawford that i had been too apt to dwell on for many months past that perhaps it was best for me i had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship feelings hopes which must at any rate have been torn from me now and yet that i must and would confess that could i have restored her to what she had appeared to me before i would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem this is what i said the purport of it but as you may imagine not spoken so collectedly or methodically as i have repeated it to you she was astonished exceedingly astonished more than astonished i saw her change countenance she turned extremely red i imagined i saw a mixture of many feelings a great though short struggle half a wish of yielding to truths half a sense of shame but habit habit carried it she would have laughed if she could it was a sort of laugh as she answered
p02088_B,02088,B,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p02089_B,02089,B,yes my dear it is very uncomfortable indeed
p02090_B,02090,B,what shall we do the gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party
p02091_B,02091,B,aye so we do that is very disagreeable i wish we had a large acquaintance here
p02092_B,02092,B,i wish we had any it would be somebody to go to
p02093_B,02093,B,very true my dear and if we knew anybody we would join them directly the skinners were here last year i wish they were here now
p02094_B,02094,B,had not we better go away as it is here are no tea things for us you see
p02095_B,02095,B,no more there are indeed how very provoking but i think we had better sit still for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd how is my head my dear somebody gave me a push that has hurt it i am afraid
p02096_B,02096,B,no indeed it looks very nice but dear mrs allen are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people i think you must know somebody
p02097_B,02097,B,i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back
p02098_B,02098,B,very agreeable indeed
p02099_B,02099,B,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p02100_B,02100,B,we shall do better another evening i hope
p02101_B,02101,B,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p02102_B,02102,B,no trouble i assure you madam have you been long in bath madam
p02103_B,02103,B,about a week sir
p02104_B,02104,B,why indeed but some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply and surprise is more easily assumed and not less reasonable than any other now let us go on were you never here before madam
p02105_B,02105,B,never sir
p02106_B,02106,B,indeed have you yet honoured the upper rooms
p02107_B,02107,B,yes sir i was there last monday
p02108_B,02108,B,have you been to the theatre
p02109_B,02109,B,yes sir i was at the play on tuesday
p02110_B,02110,B,to the concert
p02111_B,02111,B,yes sir on wednesday
p02112_B,02112,B,and are you altogether pleased with bath
p02113_B,02113,B,yes i like it very well
p02114_B,02114,B,now i must give one smirk and then we may be rational again i see what you think of me i shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow
p02115_B,02115,B,my journal
p02116_B,02116,B,yes i know exactly what you will say friday went to the lower rooms wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage but was strangely harassed by a queer half witted man who would make me dance with him and distressed me by his nonsense
p02117_B,02117,B,indeed i shall say no such thing
p02118_B,02118,B,shall i tell you what you ought to say
p02119_B,02119,B,if you please
p02120_B,02120,B,i danced with a very agreeable young man introduced by mr king had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope i may know more of him that madam is what i wish you to say
p02121_B,02121,B,but perhaps i keep no journal
p02122_B,02122,B,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal
p02123_B,02123,B,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side
p02124_B,02124,B,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars
p02125_B,02125,B,and what are they
p02126_B,02126,B,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar
p02127_B,02127,B,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way
p02128_B,02128,B,i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes
p02129_B,02129,B,that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam
p02130_B,02130,B,do you understand muslins sir
p02131_B,02131,B,particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin
p02132_B,02132,B,men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir
p02133_B,02133,B,i hope i am madam
p02134_B,02134,B,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown
p02135_B,02135,B,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p02136_B,02136,B,how can you be so
p02137_B,02137,B,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p02138_B,02138,B,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p02139_B,02139,B,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p02140_B,02140,B,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory
p02141_B,02141,B,i was not thinking of anything
p02142_B,02142,B,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me
p02143_B,02143,B,well then i will not
p02144_B,02144,B,thank you for now we shall soon be acquainted as i am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much
p02145_B,02145,B,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p02146_B,02146,B,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p02147_B,02147,B,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p02148_B,02148,B,oh these ten ages at least i am sure i have been here this half hour but now let us go and sit down at the other end of the room and enjoy ourselves i have an hundred things to say to you in the first place i was so afraid it would rain this morning just as i wanted to set off it looked very showery and that would have thrown me into agonies do you know i saw the prettiest hat you can imagine in a shop window in milsom street just now very like yours only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green i quite longed for it but my dearest catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning have you gone on with udolpho
p02149_B,02149,B,yes i have been reading it ever since i woke and i am got to the black veil
p02150_B,02150,B,are you indeed how delightful oh i would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world are not you wild to know
p02151_B,02151,B,oh yes quite what can it be but do not tell me i would not be told upon any account i know it must be a skeleton i am sure it is laurentina s skeleton oh i am delighted with the book i should like to spend my whole life in reading it i assure you if it had not been to meet you i would not have come away from it for all the world
p02152_B,02152,B,dear creature how much i am obliged to you and when you have finished udolpho we will read the italian together and i have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you
p02153_B,02153,B,have you indeed how glad i am what are they all
p02154_B,02154,B,i will read you their names directly here they are in my pocketbook castle of wolfenbach clermont mysterious warnings necromancer of the black forest midnight bell orphan of the rhine and horrid mysteries those will last us some time
p02155_B,02155,B,yes pretty well but are they all horrid are you sure they are all horrid
p02156_B,02156,B,yes quite sure for a particular friend of mine a miss andrews a sweet girl one of the sweetest creatures in the world has read every one of them i wish you knew miss andrews you would be delighted with her she is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive i think her as beautiful as an angel and i am so vexed with the men for not admiring her i scold them all amazingly about it
p02157_B,02157,B,scold them do you scold them for not admiring her
p02158_B,02158,B,yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men
p02159_B,02159,B,oh dear how can you say so
p02160_B,02160,B,i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings
p02161_B,02161,B,but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again
p02162_B,02162,B,not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so
p02163_B,02163,B,no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it
p02164_B,02164,B,it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels
p02165_B,02165,B,no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way
p02166_B,02166,B,sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume
p02167_B,02167,B,it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining
p02168_B,02168,B,do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know
p02169_B,02169,B,but it does not signify if they do
p02170_B,02170,B,signify oh heavens i make it a rule never to mind what they say they are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit and make them keep their distance
p02171_B,02171,B,are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me
p02172_B,02172,B,oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair
p02173_B,02173,B,i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark
p02174_B,02174,B,very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description
p02175_B,02175,B,betray you what do you mean
p02176_B,02176,B,nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject for heaven s sake let us move away from this end of the room do you know there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour they really put me quite out of countenance let us go and look at the arrivals they will hardly follow us there they are not coming this way are they i hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us pray let me know if they are coming i am determined i will not look up and which way are they gone one was a very good looking young man
p02177_B,02177,B,they went towards the church yard
p02178_B,02178,B,well i am amazingly glad i have got rid of them and now what say you to going to edgar s buildings with me and looking at my new hat you said you should like to see it
p02179_B,02179,B,only perhaps we may overtake the two young men
p02180_B,02180,B,oh never mind that if we make haste we shall pass by them presently and i am dying to show you my hat
p02181_B,02181,B,but if we only wait a few minutes there will be no danger of our seeing them at all
p02182_B,02182,B,i shall not pay them any such compliment i assure you i have no notion of treating men with such respect that is the way to spoil them oh these odious gigs how i detest them delightful mr morland and my brother
p02183_B,02183,B,good heaven tis james
p02184_B,02184,B,i do not know the distance
p02185_B,02185,B,three and twenty
p02186_B,02186,B,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p02187_B,02187,B,ten o clock it was eleven upon my soul i counted every stroke this brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses miss morland do but look at my horse did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life such true blood three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles look at that creature and suppose it possible if you can
p02188_B,02188,B,he does look very hot to be sure
p02189_B,02189,B,hot he had not turned a hair till we came to walcot church but look at his forehand look at his loins only see how he moves that horse cannot go less than ten miles an hour tie his legs and he will get on what do you think of my gig miss morland a neat one is not it well hung town built i have not had it a month it was built for a christchurch man a friend of mine a very good sort of fellow he ran it a few weeks till i believe it was convenient to have done with it i happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind though i had pretty well determined on a curricle too but i chanced to meet him on magdalen bridge as he was driving into oxford last term ah thorpe said he do you happen to want such a little thing as this it is a capital one of the kind but i am cursed tired of it oh d said i i am your man what do you ask and how much do you think he did miss morland
p02190_B,02190,B,i am sure i cannot guess at all
p02191_B,02191,B,curricle hung you see seat trunk sword case splashing board lamps silver moulding all you see complete the iron work as good as new or better he asked fifty guineas i closed with him directly threw down the money and the carriage was mine
p02192_B,02192,B,and i am sure i know so little of such things that i cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear
p02193_B,02193,B,neither one nor t other i might have got it for less i dare say but i hate haggling and poor freeman wanted cash
p02194_B,02194,B,that was very good natured of you
p02195_B,02195,B,oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful
p02196_B,02196,B,my horse oh d it i would not sell my horse for a hundred are you fond of an open carriage miss morland
p02197_B,02197,B,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p02198_B,02198,B,i am glad of it i will drive you out in mine every day
p02199_B,02199,B,thank you
p02200_B,02200,B,i will drive you up lansdown hill tomorrow
p02201_B,02201,B,thank you but will not your horse want rest
p02202_B,02202,B,rest he has only come three and twenty miles today all nonsense nothing ruins horses so much as rest nothing knocks them up so soon no no i shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while i am here
p02203_B,02203,B,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p02204_B,02204,B,forty aye fifty for what i care well i will drive you up lansdown tomorrow mind i am engaged
p02205_B,02205,B,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p02206_B,02206,B,a third indeed no no i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about that would be a good joke faith morland must take care of you
p02207_B,02207,B,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p02208_B,02208,B,udolpho oh lord not i i never read novels i have something else to do novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since tom jones except the monk i read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation
p02209_B,02209,B,i think you must like udolpho if you were to read it it is so very interesting
p02210_B,02210,B,not i faith no if i read any it shall be mrs radcliffe s her novels are amusing enough they are worth reading some fun and nature in them
p02211_B,02211,B,udolpho was written by mrs radcliffe
p02212_B,02212,B,no sure was it aye i remember so it was i was thinking of that other stupid book written by that woman they make such a fuss about she who married the french emigrant
p02213_B,02213,B,i suppose you mean camilla
p02214_B,02214,B,yes that s the book such unnatural stuff an old man playing at see saw i took up the first volume once and looked it over but i soon found it would not do indeed i guessed what sort of stuff it must be before i saw it as soon as i heard she had married an emigrant i was sure i should never be able to get through it
p02215_B,02215,B,i have never read it
p02216_B,02216,B,you had no loss i assure you it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing at see saw and learning latin upon my soul there is not
p02217_B,02217,B,well catherine how do you like my friend thorpe
p02218_B,02218,B,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p02219_B,02219,B,he is as good natured a fellow as ever lived a little of a rattle but that will recommend him to your sex i believe and how do you like the rest of the family
p02220_B,02220,B,very very much indeed isabella particularly
p02221_B,02221,B,i am very glad to hear you say so she is just the kind of young woman i could wish to see you attached to she has so much good sense and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable i always wanted you to know her and she seems very fond of you she said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as miss thorpe even you catherine may be proud of
p02222_B,02222,B,indeed i am i love her exceedingly and am delighted to find that you like her too you hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there
p02223_B,02223,B,because i thought i should soon see you myself i hope you will be a great deal together while you are in bath she is a most amiable girl such a superior understanding how fond all the family are of her she is evidently the general favourite and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she
p02224_B,02224,B,yes very much indeed i fancy mr allen thinks her the prettiest girl in bath
p02225_B,02225,B,i dare say he does and i do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than mr allen i need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear catherine with such a companion and friend as isabella thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the allens i am sure are very kind to you
p02226_B,02226,B,yes very kind i never was so happy before and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see me
p02227_B,02227,B,indeed catherine i love you dearly
p02228_B,02228,B,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p02229_B,02229,B,well sir and i dare say you are not sorry to be back again for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too i tell mr allen when he talks of being sick of it that i am sure he should not complain for it is so very agreeable a place that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year i tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health
p02230_B,02230,B,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p02231_B,02231,B,thank you sir i have no doubt that he will a neighbour of ours dr skinner was here for his health last winter and came away quite stout
p02232_B,02232,B,that circumstance must give great encouragement
p02233_B,02233,B,yes sir and dr skinner and his family were here three months so i tell mr allen he must not be in a hurry to get away
p02234_B,02234,B,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p02235_B,02235,B,so i told your brother all the time but he would not believe me do go and see for her mr morland said i but all in vain he would not stir an inch was not it so mr morland but you men are all so immoderately lazy i have been scolding him to such a degree my dear catherine you would be quite amazed you know i never stand upon ceremony with such people
p02236_B,02236,B,look at that young lady with the white beads round her head it is mr tilney s sister
p02237_B,02237,B,oh heavens you don t say so let me look at her this moment what a delightful girl i never saw anything half so beautiful but where is her all conquering brother is he in the room point him out to me this instant if he is i die to see him mr morland you are not to listen we are not talking about you
p02238_B,02238,B,but what is all this whispering about what is going on
p02239_B,02239,B,there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter
p02240_B,02240,B,and is that likely to satisfy me do you think
p02241_B,02241,B,well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable i tell you mr morland i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners
p02242_B,02242,B,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p02243_B,02243,B,nonsense how can you say so but when you men have a point to carry you never stick at anything my sweet catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing now would not it
p02244_B,02244,B,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p02245_B,02245,B,there you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me
p02246_B,02246,B,very agreeable madam
p02247_B,02247,B,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p02248_B,02248,B,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p02249_B,02249,B,no where is he
p02250_B,02250,B,he was with us just now and said he was so tired of lounging about that he was resolved to go and dance so i thought perhaps he would ask you if he met with you
p02251_B,02251,B,where can he be
p02252_B,02252,B,ah he has got a partner i wish he had asked you he is a very agreeable young man
p02253_B,02253,B,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p02254_B,02254,B,i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son
p02255_B,02255,B,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p02256_B,02256,B,do not you then let us walk about and quiz people come along with me and i will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room my two younger sisters and their partners i have been laughing at them this half hour
p02257_B,02257,B,what do you mean where are you all going to
p02258_B,02258,B,going to why you have not forgot our engagement did not we agree together to take a drive this morning what a head you have we are going up claverton down
p02259_B,02259,B,something was said about it i remember but really i did not expect you
p02260_B,02260,B,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p02261_B,02261,B,well ma am what do you say to it can you spare me for an hour or two shall i go
p02262_B,02262,B,do just as you please my dear
p02263_B,02263,B,oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich
p02264_B,02264,B,and no children at all
p02265_B,02265,B,no not any
p02266_B,02266,B,a famous thing for his next heirs he is your godfather is not he
p02267_B,02267,B,my godfather no
p02268_B,02268,B,but you are always very much with them
p02269_B,02269,B,yes very much
p02270_B,02270,B,aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now
p02271_B,02271,B,his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night
p02272_B,02272,B,lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of this that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all
p02273_B,02273,B,i cannot believe it
p02274_B,02274,B,oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help
p02275_B,02275,B,and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford
p02276_B,02276,B,oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way mine is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there
p02277_B,02277,B,yes it does give a notion and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much you do not really think mr thorpe that james s gig will break down
p02278_B,02278,B,break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds
p02279_B,02279,B,good heavens then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is
p02280_B,02280,B,unsafe oh lord what is there in that they will only get a roll if it does break down and there is plenty of dirt it will be excellent falling oh curse it the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out lord bless you i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to york and back again without losing a nail
p02281_B,02281,B,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p02282_B,02282,B,so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going
p02283_B,02283,B,you have seen mrs thorpe then
p02284_B,02284,B,yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce
p02285_B,02285,B,did you see anybody else of our acquaintance
p02286_B,02286,B,yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her
p02287_B,02287,B,did you indeed and did they speak to you
p02288_B,02288,B,yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family
p02289_B,02289,B,and what did she tell you of them
p02290_B,02290,B,oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else
p02291_B,02291,B,did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from
p02292_B,02292,B,yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse
p02293_B,02293,B,and are mr and mrs tilney in bath
p02294_B,02294,B,yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died
p02295_B,02295,B,and is mr tilney my partner the only son
p02296_B,02296,B,i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well
p02297_B,02297,B,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p02298_B,02298,B,oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it
p02299_B,02299,B,no indeed i should not
p02300_B,02300,B,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p02301_B,02301,B,indeed you do me injustice i would not have made so improper a remark upon any account and besides i am sure it would never have entered my head
p02302_B,02302,B,henry yes he does dance very well
p02303_B,02303,B,he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe you cannot think how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away
p02304_B,02304,B,when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us
p02305_B,02305,B,that never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith
p02306_B,02306,B,yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes
p02307_B,02307,B,i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty
p02308_B,02308,B,not very
p02309_B,02309,B,he never comes to the pump room i suppose
p02310_B,02310,B,yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father
p02311_B,02311,B,i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow
p02312_B,02312,B,perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall
p02313_B,02313,B,i am glad of it for we shall all be there
p02314_B,02314,B,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p02315_B,02315,B,that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously
p02316_B,02316,B,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p02317_B,02317,B,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p02318_B,02318,B,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p02319_B,02319,B,but they are such very different things
p02320_B,02320,B,that you think they cannot be compared together
p02321_B,02321,B,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour
p02322_B,02322,B,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this
p02323_B,02323,B,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them
p02324_B,02324,B,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison
p02325_B,02325,B,no indeed i never thought of that
p02326_B,02326,B,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose
p02327_B,02327,B,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with
p02328_B,02328,B,and is that to be my only security alas alas
p02329_B,02329,B,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody
p02330_B,02330,B,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before
p02331_B,02331,B,yes quite more so indeed
p02332_B,02332,B,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks
p02333_B,02333,B,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months
p02334_B,02334,B,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer
p02335_B,02335,B,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there
p02336_B,02336,B,you are not fond of the country
p02337_B,02337,B,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another
p02338_B,02338,B,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country
p02339_B,02339,B,do i
p02340_B,02340,B,do you not
p02341_B,02341,B,i do not believe there is much difference
p02342_B,02342,B,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long
p02343_B,02343,B,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen
p02344_B,02344,B,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here
p02345_B,02345,B,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath
p02346_B,02346,B,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father
p02347_B,02347,B,i thought how it would be
p02348_B,02348,B,no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve
p02349_B,02349,B,perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty
p02350_B,02350,B,oh that will not signify i never mind dirt
p02351_B,02351,B,no i know you never mind dirt
p02352_B,02352,B,it comes on faster and faster
p02353_B,02353,B,so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet
p02354_B,02354,B,there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella
p02355_B,02355,B,they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time
p02356_B,02356,B,it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry
p02357_B,02357,B,anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable you will not be able to go my dear
p02358_B,02358,B,i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather
p02359_B,02359,B,always thought it would clear up
p02360_B,02360,B,isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call
p02361_B,02361,B,to bristol is not that a great way off but however i cannot go with you today because i am engaged i expect some friends every moment
p02362_B,02362,B,i doubt our being able to do so much
p02363_B,02363,B,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p02364_B,02364,B,blaize castle what is that
p02365_B,02365,B,the finest place in england worth going fifty miles at any time to see
p02366_B,02366,B,what is it really a castle an old castle
p02367_B,02367,B,the oldest in the kingdom
p02368_B,02368,B,but is it like what one reads of
p02369_B,02369,B,exactly the very same
p02370_B,02370,B,but now really are there towers and long galleries
p02371_B,02371,B,by dozens
p02372_B,02372,B,then i should like to see it but i cannot i cannot go
p02373_B,02373,B,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p02374_B,02374,B,i cannot go because i expect miss tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk they promised to come at twelve only it rained but now as it is so fine i dare say they will be here soon
p02375_B,02375,B,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p02376_B,02376,B,i do not know indeed
p02377_B,02377,B,yes i know he does i saw him you are talking of the man you danced with last night are not you
p02378_B,02378,B,did you indeed
p02379_B,02379,B,did upon my soul knew him again directly and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too
p02380_B,02380,B,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p02381_B,02381,B,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p02382_B,02382,B,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p02383_B,02383,B,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p02384_B,02384,B,yes yes every hole and corner
p02385_B,02385,B,but then if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer and call by and by
p02386_B,02386,B,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p02387_B,02387,B,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p02388_B,02388,B,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p02389_B,02389,B,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p02390_B,02390,B,who where
p02391_B,02391,B,on the right hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now
p02392_B,02392,B,stop stop mr thorpe it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton
p02393_B,02393,B,it is all one to me
p02394_B,02394,B,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p02395_B,02395,B,and why cannot he afford it
p02396_B,02396,B,because he has not money enough
p02397_B,02397,B,and whose fault is that
p02398_B,02398,B,nobody s that i know of
p02399_B,02399,B,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p02400_B,02400,B,go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
p02401_B,02401,B,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p02402_B,02402,B,my dear you tumble my gown
p02403_B,02403,B,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p02404_B,02404,B,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p02405_B,02405,B,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible
p02406_B,02406,B,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence
p02407_B,02407,B,me i take offence
p02408_B,02408,B,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry
p02409_B,02409,B,i angry i could have no right
p02410_B,02410,B,well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face
p02411_B,02411,B,but how came you to know him
p02412_B,02412,B,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath
p02413_B,02413,B,oh nonsense how can you say so
p02414_B,02414,B,and what do you think i said well done general said i i am quite of your mind
p02415_B,02415,B,do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go
p02416_B,02416,B,it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday
p02417_B,02417,B,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p02418_B,02418,B,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p02419_B,02419,B,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p02420_B,02420,B,no no no
p02421_B,02421,B,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p02422_B,02422,B,catherine you must go
p02423_B,02423,B,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p02424_B,02424,B,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p02425_B,02425,B,that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure
p02426_B,02426,B,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p02427_B,02427,B,i hope i am not less so now but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right
p02428_B,02428,B,i suspect there is no great struggle
p02429_B,02429,B,you have not
p02430_B,02430,B,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p02431_B,02431,B,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p02432_B,02432,B,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p02433_B,02433,B,let her go let her go if she will go
p02434_B,02434,B,she is as obstinate as
p02435_B,02435,B,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p02436_B,02436,B,no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable
p02437_B,02437,B,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p02438_B,02438,B,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p02439_B,02439,B,yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it
p02440_B,02440,B,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p02441_B,02441,B,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p02442_B,02442,B,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p02443_B,02443,B,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p02444_B,02444,B,that is just what i was going to say
p02445_B,02445,B,you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will
p02446_B,02446,B,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p02447_B,02447,B,you have been abroad then
p02448_B,02448,B,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say
p02449_B,02449,B,why not
p02450_B,02450,B,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p02451_B,02451,B,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
p02452_B,02452,B,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p02453_B,02453,B,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion
p02454_B,02454,B,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p02455_B,02455,B,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home
p02456_B,02456,B,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p02457_B,02457,B,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p02458_B,02458,B,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p02459_B,02459,B,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p02460_B,02460,B,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p02461_B,02461,B,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p02462_B,02462,B,to say the truth i do not much like any other
p02463_B,02463,B,yes i am fond of history
p02464_B,02464,B,i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books
p02465_B,02465,B,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p02466_B,02466,B,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it
p02467_B,02467,B,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p02468_B,02468,B,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words
p02469_B,02469,B,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p02470_B,02470,B,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london
p02471_B,02471,B,indeed and of what nature
p02472_B,02472,B,that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet
p02473_B,02473,B,good heaven where could you hear of such a thing
p02474_B,02474,B,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p02475_B,02475,B,you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect
p02476_B,02476,B,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p02477_B,02477,B,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p02478_B,02478,B,riot what riot
p02479_B,02479,B,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p02480_B,02480,B,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p02481_B,02481,B,i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them
p02482_B,02482,B,no doubt but that is no explanation of the present
p02483_B,02483,B,what am i to do
p02484_B,02484,B,you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women
p02485_B,02485,B,miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company
p02486_B,02486,B,that is not enough be more serious
p02487_B,02487,B,miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half
p02488_B,02488,B,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me
p02489_B,02489,B,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p02490_B,02490,B,thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us
p02491_B,02491,B,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p02492_B,02492,B,you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you
p02493_B,02493,B,it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately
p02494_B,02494,B,morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody
p02495_B,02495,B,indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify
p02496_B,02496,B,oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice
p02497_B,02497,B,i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you
p02498_B,02498,B,for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond
p02499_B,02499,B,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p02500_B,02500,B,i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it tonight to salisbury we may have it tomorrow tomorrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me
p02501_B,02501,B,well miss morland i am come to bid you good bye
p02502_B,02502,B,shall not you be late at devizes
p02503_B,02503,B,a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland i say it is no bad notion
p02504_B,02504,B,i am sure i think it a very good one
p02505_B,02505,B,do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope
p02506_B,02506,B,yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible
p02507_B,02507,B,and then you know i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song
p02508_B,02508,B,may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney today and must now be going home
p02509_B,02509,B,nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me
p02510_B,02510,B,then why do you stay away so long
p02511_B,02511,B,that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you
p02512_B,02512,B,oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you
p02513_B,02513,B,but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable
p02514_B,02514,B,pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you
p02515_B,02515,B,and i hope i hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me
p02516_B,02516,B,oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful
p02517_B,02517,B,that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters
p02518_B,02518,B,perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about
p02519_B,02519,B,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p02520_B,02520,B,very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient
p02521_B,02521,B,oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day
p02522_B,02522,B,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits
p02523_B,02523,B,how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you
p02524_B,02524,B,unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me
p02525_B,02525,B,that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart
p02526_B,02526,B,but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy
p02527_B,02527,B,oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment
p02528_B,02528,B,well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms
p02529_B,02529,B,and must i go
p02530_B,02530,B,do not you intend it i thought it was all settled
p02531_B,02531,B,nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself
p02532_B,02532,B,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world
p02533_B,02533,B,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions
p02534_B,02534,B,why what do you mean
p02535_B,02535,B,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so
p02536_B,02536,B,i do not understand you
p02537_B,02537,B,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well
p02538_B,02538,B,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible
p02539_B,02539,B,bravo an excellent satire on modern language
p02540_B,02540,B,but pray tell me what you mean
p02541_B,02541,B,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us
p02542_B,02542,B,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid
p02543_B,02543,B,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world
p02544_B,02544,B,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance
p02545_B,02545,B,and did isabella never change her mind before
p02546_B,02546,B,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her
p02547_B,02547,B,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself
p02548_B,02548,B,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general
p02549_B,02549,B,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour
p02550_B,02550,B,then why did not you
p02551_B,02551,B,oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us
p02552_B,02552,B,he is very handsome indeed
p02553_B,02553,B,handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way
p02554_B,02554,B,mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear
p02555_B,02555,B,it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself
p02556_B,02556,B,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p02557_B,02557,B,nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money
p02558_B,02558,B,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p02559_B,02559,B,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p02560_B,02560,B,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p02561_B,02561,B,by the end of another week
p02562_B,02562,B,yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home
p02563_B,02563,B,i am very sorry for it if i had known this before
p02564_B,02564,B,perhaps you would be so good it would make me very happy if
p02565_B,02565,B,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p02566_B,02566,B,well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable
p02567_B,02567,B,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p02568_B,02568,B,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world
p02569_B,02569,B,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p02570_B,02570,B,psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it
p02571_B,02571,B,you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming
p02572_B,02572,B,i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp
p02573_B,02573,B,but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me
p02574_B,02574,B,oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents
p02575_B,02575,B,no indeed i cannot
p02576_B,02576,B,my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you
p02577_B,02577,B,with me dear isabella
p02578_B,02578,B,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance
p02579_B,02579,B,as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning
p02580_B,02580,B,but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house
p02581_B,02581,B,are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters
p02582_B,02582,B,yes yes there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so
p02583_B,02583,B,i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it
p02584_B,02584,B,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last
p02585_B,02585,B,you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment
p02586_B,02586,B,oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter
p02587_B,02587,B,but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened
p02588_B,02588,B,my dearest catherine i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure
p02589_B,02589,B,psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent
p02590_B,02590,B,i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me
p02591_B,02591,B,my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts
p02592_B,02592,B,if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough
p02593_B,02593,B,do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you i hope your eyes are not tormented now
p02594_B,02594,B,never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little
p02595_B,02595,B,does he then why does he stay here why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable
p02596_B,02596,B,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that
p02597_B,02597,B,then you will persuade him to go away
p02598_B,02598,B,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master
p02599_B,02599,B,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable
p02600_B,02600,B,and are you sure it is my brother s doing
p02601_B,02601,B,yes very sure
p02602_B,02602,B,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain
p02603_B,02603,B,is not it the same thing
p02604_B,02604,B,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment
p02605_B,02605,B,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him
p02606_B,02606,B,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick
p02607_B,02607,B,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another
p02608_B,02608,B,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little
p02609_B,02609,B,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother
p02610_B,02610,B,i can have no opinion on that subject
p02611_B,02611,B,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour
p02612_B,02612,B,you are a very close questioner
p02613_B,02613,B,am i i only ask what i want to be told
p02614_B,02614,B,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell
p02615_B,02615,B,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart
p02616_B,02616,B,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at
p02617_B,02617,B,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go
p02618_B,02618,B,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month
p02619_B,02619,B,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there
p02620_B,02620,B,how sorry you must be for that
p02621_B,02621,B,i am always sorry to leave eleanor
p02622_B,02622,B,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable
p02623_B,02623,B,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey
p02624_B,02624,B,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about
p02625_B,02625,B,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry
p02626_B,02626,B,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens
p02627_B,02627,B,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you
p02628_B,02628,B,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure
p02629_B,02629,B,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock
p02630_B,02630,B,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then
p02631_B,02631,B,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room
p02632_B,02632,B,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing
p02633_B,02633,B,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness
p02634_B,02634,B,oh no no do not say so well go on
p02635_B,02635,B,no indeed
p02636_B,02636,B,and how might you learn by accident or argument
p02637_B,02637,B,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers
p02638_B,02638,B,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose
p02639_B,02639,B,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within
p02640_B,02640,B,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction
p02641_B,02641,B,is it a pretty place
p02642_B,02642,B,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p02643_B,02643,B,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p02644_B,02644,B,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p02645_B,02645,B,how were mr allen s succession houses worked
p02646_B,02646,B,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p02647_B,02647,B,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p02648_B,02648,B,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p02649_B,02649,B,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p02650_B,02650,B,a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary
p02651_B,02651,B,to be sure you must miss him very much
p02652_B,02652,B,a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other
p02653_B,02653,B,was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits her picture i suppose hangs in your father s room
p02654_B,02654,B,no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like
p02655_B,02655,B,i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died
p02656_B,02656,B,it remains as it was i suppose
p02657_B,02657,B,yes entirely
p02658_B,02658,B,and how long ago may it be that your mother died
p02659_B,02659,B,she has been dead these nine years
p02660_B,02660,B,you were with her i suppose to the last
p02661_B,02661,B,no i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over my father often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual
p02662_B,02662,B,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p02663_B,02663,B,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine
p02664_B,02664,B,i have been to see your mother s room
p02665_B,02665,B,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there
p02666_B,02666,B,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow
p02667_B,02667,B,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use
p02668_B,02668,B,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride
p02669_B,02669,B,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself
p02670_B,02670,B,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only your father was with us
p02671_B,02671,B,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage
p02672_B,02672,B,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress
p02673_B,02673,B,it is only a quarter past four and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough have you had any letter from bath since i saw you
p02674_B,02674,B,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly
p02675_B,02675,B,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose
p02676_B,02676,B,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her
p02677_B,02677,B,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin
p02678_B,02678,B,but your father was he afflicted
p02679_B,02679,B,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death
p02680_B,02680,B,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking
p02681_B,02681,B,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting
p02682_B,02682,B,tis only from james however
p02683_B,02683,B,no i thank you they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again
p02684_B,02684,B,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p02685_B,02685,B,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why
p02686_B,02686,B,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress
p02687_B,02687,B,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world
p02688_B,02688,B,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story
p02689_B,02689,B,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part
p02690_B,02690,B,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother
p02691_B,02691,B,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice
p02692_B,02692,B,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p02693_B,02693,B,her mother is a very good sort of woman
p02694_B,02694,B,what was her father
p02695_B,02695,B,a lawyer i believe they live at putney
p02696_B,02696,B,are they a wealthy family
p02697_B,02697,B,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p02698_B,02698,B,but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved
p02699_B,02699,B,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p02700_B,02700,B,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p02701_B,02701,B,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p02702_B,02702,B,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p02703_B,02703,B,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before
p02704_B,02704,B,among all the great variety that you have known and studied
p02705_B,02705,B,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it
p02706_B,02706,B,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this
p02707_B,02707,B,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p02708_B,02708,B,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves
p02709_B,02709,B,but he will tell only half of it
p02710_B,02710,B,a quarter would be enough
p02711_B,02711,B,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p02712_B,02712,B,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it
p02713_B,02713,B,go away and why
p02714_B,02714,B,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure
p02715_B,02715,B,oh not seriously
p02716_B,02716,B,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay
p02717_B,02717,B,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify
p02718_B,02718,B,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return
p02719_B,02719,B,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p02720_B,02720,B,i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste
p02721_B,02721,B,well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage
p02722_B,02722,B,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p02723_B,02723,B,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her
p02724_B,02724,B,it will soon be as if you never had
p02725_B,02725,B,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself
p02726_B,02726,B,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause
p02727_B,02727,B,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her
p02728_B,02728,B,i am persuaded that he never did
p02729_B,02729,B,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him
p02730_B,02730,B,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment
p02731_B,02731,B,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p02732_B,02732,B,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p02733_B,02733,B,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p02734_B,02734,B,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p02735_B,02735,B,good heaven what can be the matter my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand
p02736_B,02736,B,errand to me
p02737_B,02737,B,how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you
p02738_B,02738,B,tis a messenger from woodston
p02739_B,02739,B,you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either
p02740_B,02740,B,my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton
p02741_B,02741,B,it will not be in my power catherine
p02742_B,02742,B,come when you can then monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home
p02743_B,02743,B,ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing
p02744_B,02744,B,have i offended the general
p02745_B,02745,B,alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible
p02746_B,02746,B,i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence
p02747_B,02747,B,i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended
p02748_B,02748,B,oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time
p02749_B,02749,B,i shall see you in the morning you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice
p02750_B,02750,B,no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe
p02751_B,02751,B,i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you
p02752_B,02752,B,oh eleanor i will write to you indeed
p02753_B,02753,B,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p02754_B,02754,B,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets
p02755_B,02755,B,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p02756_B,02756,B,if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be we are sorry for him but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice
p02757_B,02757,B,i really have not patience with the general
p02758_B,02758,B,yes but that did not last long
p02759_B,02759,B,very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening
p02760_B,02760,B,do i oh perfectly
p02761_B,02761,B,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p02762_B,02762,B,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p02763_B,02763,B,her head did not run upon bath much
p02764_B,02764,B,then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger
p02765_B,02765,B,i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat
p02766_B,02766,B,there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good
p02767_B,02767,B,catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure
p02768_B,02768,B,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd
p02769_B,02769,B,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p02770_B,02770,B,there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description
p02771_B,02771,B,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p02772_B,02772,B,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p02773_B,02773,B,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p02774_B,02774,B,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p02775_B,02775,B,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p02776_B,02776,B,oh certainly
p02777_B,02777,B,the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it
p02778_B,02778,B,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p02779_B,02779,B,and who is admiral croft
p02780_B,02780,B,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p02781_B,02781,B,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p02782_B,02782,B,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p02783_B,02783,B,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p02784_B,02784,B,bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed
p02785_B,02785,B,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p02786_B,02786,B,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p02787_B,02787,B,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p02788_B,02788,B,a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here
p02789_B,02789,B,then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath
p02790_B,02790,B,there is hardly any personal defect which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to
p02791_B,02791,B,i think very differently an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me
p02792_B,02792,B,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p02793_B,02793,B,yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning
p02794_B,02794,B,you have had your little boys with you
p02795_B,02795,B,yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad
p02796_B,02796,B,well you will soon be better now you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house
p02797_B,02797,B,i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way
p02798_B,02798,B,you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early
p02799_B,02799,B,i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday
p02800_B,02800,B,my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner
p02801_B,02801,B,dear me what can you possibly have to do
p02802_B,02802,B,a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time
p02803_B,02803,B,oh well but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday
p02804_B,02804,B,did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party
p02805_B,02805,B,oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone
p02806_B,02806,B,i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party
p02807_B,02807,B,nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it where shall we go i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you
p02808_B,02808,B,i have not the smallest objection on that account i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves
p02809_B,02809,B,oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath
p02810_B,02810,B,we are expecting a brother of mrs croft s here soon i dare say you know him by name
p02811_B,02811,B,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p02812_B,02812,B,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p02813_B,02813,B,so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday
p02814_B,02814,B,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p02815_B,02815,B,i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing
p02816_B,02816,B,but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy
p02817_B,02817,B,yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day
p02818_B,02818,B,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p02819_B,02819,B,are you serious dear me that s a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mother s feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child
p02820_B,02820,B,this is very kind of anne and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child
p02821_B,02821,B,phoo phoo what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his
p02822_B,02822,B,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p02823_B,02823,B,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p02824_B,02824,B,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p02825_B,02825,B,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p02826_B,02826,B,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p02827_B,02827,B,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p02828_B,02828,B,oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend
p02829_B,02829,B,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p02830_B,02830,B,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p02831_B,02831,B,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p02832_B,02832,B,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p02833_B,02833,B,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p02834_B,02834,B,nothing to the purpose you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board
p02835_B,02835,B,but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then
p02836_B,02836,B,all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself
p02837_B,02837,B,depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable
p02838_B,02838,B,i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board
p02839_B,02839,B,my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings
p02840_B,02840,B,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p02841_B,02841,B,but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days
p02842_B,02842,B,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p02843_B,02843,B,ay that we shall
p02844_B,02844,B,now i have done
p02845_B,02845,B,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p02846_B,02846,B,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p02847_B,02847,B,now you are talking nonsense mary it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied
p02848_B,02848,B,charles may say what he pleases but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me
p02849_B,02849,B,they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say
p02850_B,02850,B,i hope the little boy is better
p02851_B,02851,B,how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently
p02852_B,02852,B,walter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
p02853_B,02853,B,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p02854_B,02854,B,had you i honour you
p02855_B,02855,B,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p02856_B,02856,B,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p02857_B,02857,B,oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good
p02858_B,02858,B,she would have turned back then but for you
p02859_B,02859,B,she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it
p02860_B,02860,B,happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind
p02861_B,02861,B,mary is good natured enough in many respects but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne
p02862_B,02862,B,do you mean that she refused him
p02863_B,02863,B,oh yes certainly
p02864_B,02864,B,when did that happen
p02865_B,02865,B,i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary i wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell s doing that she did not they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him
p02866_B,02866,B,he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth
p02867_B,02867,B,we had better not talk about it my dear for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before
p02868_B,02868,B,well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other
p02869_B,02869,B,very good humoured unaffected girls indeed and a very respectable family one could not be connected with better people my dear admiral that post we shall certainly take that post
p02870_B,02870,B,yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london
p02871_B,02871,B,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p02872_B,02872,B,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p02873_B,02873,B,there you see just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery
p02874_B,02874,B,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p02875_B,02875,B,of course you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him
p02876_B,02876,B,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p02877_B,02877,B,ay true enough only june
p02878_B,02878,B,and not known to him perhaps so soon
p02879_B,02879,B,not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm nobody could do it but that good fellow the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week that s what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us
p02880_B,02880,B,is there no one to help me
p02881_B,02881,B,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p02882_B,02882,B,oh god her father and mother
p02883_B,02883,B,a surgeon
p02884_B,02884,B,true true a surgeon this instant
p02885_B,02885,B,captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found
p02886_B,02886,B,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p02887_B,02887,B,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p02888_B,02888,B,yes yes to the inn i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others
p02889_B,02889,B,i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it
p02890_B,02890,B,another time sir i thank you not now
p02891_B,02891,B,well whenever it suits you you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door a good place is not it but you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butler s room ay so it always is i believe one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like our own best and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not we have made very few changes either very few we told you about the laundry door at uppercross that has been a very great improvement the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better my wife should have the credit of them however i have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father s a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away from one s self so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i never go near the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place the breakfast room chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this pray say so with my compliments he will be glad to hear it
p02892_B,02892,B,now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is oh he talks of you in such terms
p02893_B,02893,B,i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you at all
p02894_B,02894,B,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p02895_B,02895,B,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p02896_B,02896,B,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p02897_B,02897,B,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p02898_B,02898,B,any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me
p02899_B,02899,B,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p02900_B,02900,B,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p02901_B,02901,B,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p02902_B,02902,B,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p02903_B,02903,B,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p02904_B,02904,B,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p02905_B,02905,B,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p02906_B,02906,B,you will not like him i will answer for it
p02907_B,02907,B,he is a man whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me
p02908_B,02908,B,oh when shall i leave you again
p02909_B,02909,B,how is mary looking the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day
p02910_B,02910,B,oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas
p02911_B,02911,B,if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse
p02912_B,02912,B,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p02913_B,02913,B,my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification
p02914_B,02914,B,merely gowland
p02915_B,02915,B,no nothing at all
p02916_B,02916,B,certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her you see how it has carried away her freckles
p02917_B,02917,B,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p02918_B,02918,B,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p02919_B,02919,B,yes we shall indeed be known to be related to them i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them
p02920_B,02920,B,pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance
p02921_B,02921,B,well i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place
p02922_B,02922,B,i love your indignation it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him
p02923_B,02923,B,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p02924_B,02924,B,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now
p02925_B,02925,B,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p02926_B,02926,B,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p02927_B,02927,B,she sees nothing to blame in it on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith
p02928_B,02928,B,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p02929_B,02929,B,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p02930_B,02930,B,i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother s place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me you are your mother s self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life
p02931_B,02931,B,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p02932_B,02932,B,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p02933_B,02933,B,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p02934_B,02934,B,have they any acquaintance here
p02935_B,02935,B,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p02936_B,02936,B,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p02937_B,02937,B,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p02938_B,02938,B,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p02939_B,02939,B,that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm that s right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is
p02940_B,02940,B,did you say that you had something to tell me sir
p02941_B,02941,B,yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick
p02942_B,02942,B,a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick
p02943_B,02943,B,well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for
p02944_B,02944,B,i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man and i understand that he bears an excellent character
p02945_B,02945,B,oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice
p02946_B,02946,B,indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please
p02947_B,02947,B,well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross
p02948_B,02948,B,i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man
p02949_B,02949,B,not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him
p02950_B,02950,B,certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort
p02951_B,02951,B,yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think poor frederick now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath
p02952_B,02952,B,i am much obliged to you but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking
p02953_B,02953,B,but it rains
p02954_B,02954,B,oh very little nothing that i regard
p02955_B,02955,B,though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair
p02956_B,02956,B,i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here in a moment i am sure good morning to you
p02957_B,02957,B,how do you do
p02958_B,02958,B,i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time it was a frightful hour a frightful day the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery
p02959_B,02959,B,certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both sides good principles and good temper
p02960_B,02960,B,yes but there i think ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not
p02961_B,02961,B,you were a good while at lyme i think
p02962_B,02962,B,about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire
p02963_B,02963,B,i should very much like to see lyme again
p02964_B,02964,B,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p02965_B,02965,B,the last hours were certainly very painful but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable
p02966_B,02966,B,yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof
p02967_B,02967,B,i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient
p02968_B,02968,B,i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman
p02969_B,02969,B,for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next
p02970_B,02970,B,perhaps i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of
p02971_B,02971,B,indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family
p02972_B,02972,B,i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me the name of anne elliot has long had an interesting sound to me very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change
p02973_B,02973,B,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p02974_B,02974,B,no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch
p02975_B,02975,B,is not this song worth staying for
p02976_B,02976,B,yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room
p02977_B,02977,B,the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them
p02978_B,02978,B,i do not know i do not think they were
p02979_B,02979,B,old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course
p02980_B,02980,B,no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little
p02981_B,02981,B,oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond
p02982_B,02982,B,but i ought to have looked about me more
p02983_B,02983,B,no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation
p02984_B,02984,B,do you see that in my eye
p02985_B,02985,B,yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together and such being the case i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time pray is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath
p02986_B,02986,B,mr elliot are you acquainted with mr elliot
p02987_B,02987,B,i have been a good deal acquainted with him but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met
p02988_B,02988,B,i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you
p02989_B,02989,B,to confess the truth that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done
p02990_B,02990,B,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me
p02991_B,02991,B,i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune
p02992_B,02992,B,no nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am
p02993_B,02993,B,now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis
p02994_B,02994,B,my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one
p02995_B,02995,B,oh if these are your only objections mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin
p02996_B,02996,B,no i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that do tell me how it first came into your head
p02997_B,02997,B,it first came into my head upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago
p02998_B,02998,B,and has it indeed been spoken of
p02999_B,02999,B,did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday
p03000_B,03000,B,no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular
p03001_B,03001,B,it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
p03002_B,03002,B,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message
p03003_B,03003,B,no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with
p03004_B,03004,B,i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years
p03005_B,03005,B,i did
p03006_B,03006,B,not before he was married i suppose
p03007_B,03007,B,yes he was not married when i knew him first
p03008_B,03008,B,and were you much acquainted
p03009_B,03009,B,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him
p03010_B,03010,B,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man
p03011_B,03011,B,i know it all i know it all he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put
p03012_B,03012,B,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back
p03013_B,03013,B,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other
p03014_B,03014,B,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot
p03015_B,03015,B,to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from
p03016_B,03016,B,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character
p03017_B,03017,B,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty
p03018_B,03018,B,but was not she a very low woman
p03019_B,03019,B,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof
p03020_B,03020,B,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now
p03021_B,03021,B,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger
p03022_B,03022,B,thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now
p03023_B,03023,B,i can explain this too
p03024_B,03024,B,can you really
p03025_B,03025,B,yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis
p03026_B,03026,B,colonel wallis you are acquainted with him
p03027_B,03027,B,no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed
p03028_B,03028,B,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived
p03029_B,03029,B,i know you did i know it all perfectly but
p03030_B,03030,B,indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left
p03031_B,03031,B,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you
p03032_B,03032,B,he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme
p03033_B,03033,B,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do
p03034_B,03034,B,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not
p03035_B,03035,B,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation
p03036_B,03036,B,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness
p03037_B,03037,B,my dear there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better
p03038_B,03038,B,indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty
p03039_B,03039,B,oh i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect
p03040_B,03040,B,quite delightful exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son
p03041_B,03041,B,oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men
p03042_B,03042,B,my dear miss elliot
p03043_B,03043,B,well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him
p03044_B,03044,B,and mine kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately
p03045_B,03045,B,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p03046_B,03046,B,oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now
p03047_B,03047,B,such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now
p03048_B,03048,B,yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long
p03049_B,03049,B,that cannot be much to your taste i know but i do believe him to be an excellent young man
p03050_B,03050,B,to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since
p03051_B,03051,B,no it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow
p03052_B,03052,B,yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend
p03053_B,03053,B,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p03054_B,03054,B,phoo phoo what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play
p03055_B,03055,B,oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go
p03056_B,03056,B,no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise
p03057_B,03057,B,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p03058_B,03058,B,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p03059_B,03059,B,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p03060_B,03060,B,if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps
p03061_B,03061,B,oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player
p03062_B,03062,B,you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes
p03063_B,03063,B,i am not yet so much changed
p03064_B,03064,B,it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period
p03065_B,03065,B,and so ma am all these thing considered though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement
p03066_B,03066,B,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p03067_B,03067,B,oh dear mrs croft there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement
p03068_B,03068,B,yes dear ma am or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can
p03069_B,03069,B,certainly captain benwick
p03070_B,03070,B,yes and you may guess who it is for but it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it he is writing about it now poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon
p03071_B,03071,B,no that i can easily believe
p03072_B,03072,B,it was not in her nature she doted on him
p03073_B,03073,B,it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions
p03074_B,03074,B,granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since
p03075_B,03075,B,true very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick
p03076_B,03076,B,no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather
p03077_B,03077,B,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p03078_B,03078,B,we shall never agree upon this question
p03079_B,03079,B,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p03080_B,03080,B,there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men
p03081_B,03081,B,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p03082_B,03082,B,but how shall we prove anything
p03083_B,03083,B,we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said
p03084_B,03084,B,ah if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts
p03085_B,03085,B,oh i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone
p03086_B,03086,B,you are a good soul there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied
p03087_B,03087,B,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p03088_B,03088,B,good morning god bless you
p03089_B,03089,B,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p03090_B,03090,B,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p03091_B,03091,B,oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going
p03092_B,03092,B,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p03093_B,03093,B,to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say
p03094_B,03094,B,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p03095_B,03095,B,i hardly know
p03096_B,03096,B,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
p03097_B,03097,B,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me
p03098_B,03098,B,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
p03099_B,03099,B,perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added
p03100_B,03100,B,i should have thought that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this
p03101_B,03101,B,no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here
p03102_B,03102,B,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion
p03103_B,03103,B,not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then
p03104_B,03104,B,would i
p03105_B,03105,B,good god you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards like other great men under reverses i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve
p03106_B,03106,B,you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it
p03107_B,03107,B,why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week
p03108_B,03108,B,what is his name
p03109_B,03109,B,oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls
p03110_B,03110,B,how so how can it affect them
p03111_B,03111,B,my dear mr bennet how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them
p03112_B,03112,B,is that his design in settling here
p03113_B,03113,B,design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes
p03114_B,03114,B,i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party
p03115_B,03115,B,my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty
p03116_B,03116,B,in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of
p03117_B,03117,B,but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood
p03118_B,03118,B,it is more than i engage for i assure you
p03119_B,03119,B,but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not
p03120_B,03120,B,you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy
p03121_B,03121,B,i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference
p03122_B,03122,B,they have none of them much to recommend them they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters
p03123_B,03123,B,mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves
p03124_B,03124,B,you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least
p03125_B,03125,B,ah you do not know what i suffer
p03126_B,03126,B,but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood
p03127_B,03127,B,it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
p03128_B,03128,B,depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all
p03129_B,03129,B,we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes since we are not to visit
p03130_B,03130,B,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p03131_B,03131,B,i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her
p03132_B,03132,B,no more have i and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
p03133_B,03133,B,don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
p03134_B,03134,B,kitty has no discretion in her coughs she times them ill
p03135_B,03135,B,i do not cough for my own amusement
p03136_B,03136,B,to morrow fortnight
p03137_B,03137,B,aye so it is and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself
p03138_B,03138,B,then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her
p03139_B,03139,B,impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing
p03140_B,03140,B,i honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself
p03141_B,03141,B,nonsense nonsense
p03142_B,03142,B,what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts while mary is adjusting her ideas let us return to mr bingley
p03143_B,03143,B,i am sick of mr bingley
p03144_B,03144,B,i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now
p03145_B,03145,B,how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now
p03146_B,03146,B,now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse
p03147_B,03147,B,what an excellent father you have girls i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball
p03148_B,03148,B,oh i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest
p03149_B,03149,B,if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for
p03150_B,03150,B,i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with
p03151_B,03151,B,i would not be so fastidious as you are for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty
p03152_B,03152,B,you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room
p03153_B,03153,B,oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you
p03154_B,03154,B,which do you mean she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me
p03155_B,03155,B,if he had had any compassion for me he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance
p03156_B,03156,B,oh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst s gown but i can assure you that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man
p03157_B,03157,B,he is also handsome which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete
p03158_B,03158,B,i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment
p03159_B,03159,B,did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person
p03160_B,03160,B,dear lizzy
p03161_B,03161,B,oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life
p03162_B,03162,B,i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think
p03163_B,03163,B,i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his
p03164_B,03164,B,certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her
p03165_B,03165,B,yes but he seemed to like his second better
p03166_B,03166,B,oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson
p03167_B,03167,B,perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point
p03168_B,03168,B,upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know
p03169_B,03169,B,my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
p03170_B,03170,B,i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips
p03171_B,03171,B,are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
p03172_B,03172,B,miss bingley told me
p03173_B,03173,B,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
p03174_B,03174,B,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p03175_B,03175,B,another time lizzy i would not dance with him if i were you
p03176_B,03176,B,i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him
p03177_B,03177,B,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p03178_B,03178,B,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine
p03179_B,03179,B,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p03180_B,03180,B,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p03181_B,03181,B,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p03182_B,03182,B,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
p03183_B,03183,B,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
p03184_B,03184,B,remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do
p03185_B,03185,B,but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out
p03186_B,03186,B,perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses
p03187_B,03187,B,your plan is a good one where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character
p03188_B,03188,B,not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal
p03189_B,03189,B,yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded
p03190_B,03190,B,well i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life
p03191_B,03191,B,you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself what does mr darcy mean by listening to my conversation with colonel forster
p03192_B,03192,B,that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
p03193_B,03193,B,but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him
p03194_B,03194,B,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic
p03195_B,03195,B,you are severe on us
p03196_B,03196,B,it will be her turn soon to be teazed i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
p03197_B,03197,B,you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers very well if it must be so it must there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song
p03198_B,03198,B,certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance
p03199_B,03199,B,your friend performs delightfully and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy
p03200_B,03200,B,you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir
p03201_B,03201,B,yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james s
p03202_B,03202,B,never sir
p03203_B,03203,B,do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place
p03204_B,03204,B,it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
p03205_B,03205,B,you have a house in town i conclude i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas
p03206_B,03206,B,indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner
p03207_B,03207,B,you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour
p03208_B,03208,B,mr darcy is all politeness
p03209_B,03209,B,he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner
p03210_B,03210,B,i should imagine not
p03211_B,03211,B,you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them
p03212_B,03212,B,your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss elizabeth bennet
p03213_B,03213,B,miss elizabeth bennet i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy
p03214_B,03214,B,that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy
p03215_B,03215,B,nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you
p03216_B,03216,B,i am astonished my dear that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however
p03217_B,03217,B,if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it
p03218_B,03218,B,yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever
p03219_B,03219,B,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish
p03220_B,03220,B,my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals
p03221_B,03221,B,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p03222_B,03222,B,well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
p03223_B,03223,B,it is from miss bingley
p03224_B,03224,B,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p03225_B,03225,B,dining out that is very unlucky
p03226_B,03226,B,can i have the carriage
p03227_B,03227,B,no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night
p03228_B,03228,B,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p03229_B,03229,B,oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs
p03230_B,03230,B,i had much rather go in the coach
p03231_B,03231,B,but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they
p03232_B,03232,B,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p03233_B,03233,B,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p03234_B,03234,B,this was a lucky idea of mine indeed
p03235_B,03235,B,oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage how can you be so silly as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there
p03236_B,03236,B,i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
p03237_B,03237,B,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p03238_B,03238,B,no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
p03239_B,03239,B,i admire the activity of your benevolence but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
p03240_B,03240,B,if we make haste perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes
p03241_B,03241,B,she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
p03242_B,03242,B,yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office
p03243_B,03243,B,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p03244_B,03244,B,you observed it mr darcy i am sure and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition
p03245_B,03245,B,certainly not
p03246_B,03246,B,to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum
p03247_B,03247,B,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p03248_B,03248,B,i am afraid mr darcy that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes
p03249_B,03249,B,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p03250_B,03250,B,i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it
p03251_B,03251,B,i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
p03252_B,03252,B,yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
p03253_B,03253,B,that is capital
p03254_B,03254,B,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p03255_B,03255,B,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p03256_B,03256,B,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p03257_B,03257,B,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p03258_B,03258,B,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p03259_B,03259,B,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p03260_B,03260,B,i am astonished that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy
p03261_B,03261,B,it ought to be good it has been the work of many generations
p03262_B,03262,B,and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books
p03263_B,03263,B,i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
p03264_B,03264,B,neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley
p03265_B,03265,B,i wish it may
p03266_B,03266,B,but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire
p03267_B,03267,B,with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it
p03268_B,03268,B,i am talking of possibilities charles
p03269_B,03269,B,upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
p03270_B,03270,B,is miss darcy much grown since the spring will she be as tall as i am
p03271_B,03271,B,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p03272_B,03272,B,how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano forte is exquisite
p03273_B,03273,B,it is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are
p03274_B,03274,B,all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
p03275_B,03275,B,yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished
p03276_B,03276,B,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p03277_B,03277,B,nor i i am sure
p03278_B,03278,B,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p03279_B,03279,B,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
p03280_B,03280,B,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p03281_B,03281,B,all this she must possess and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading
p03282_B,03282,B,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any
p03283_B,03283,B,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this
p03284_B,03284,B,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united
p03285_B,03285,B,eliza bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
p03286_B,03286,B,undoubtedly there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
p03287_B,03287,B,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p03288_B,03288,B,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p03289_B,03289,B,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p03290_B,03290,B,whatever i do is done in a hurry and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
p03291_B,03291,B,that is exactly what i should have supposed of you
p03292_B,03292,B,you begin to comprehend me do you
p03293_B,03293,B,oh yes i understand you perfectly
p03294_B,03294,B,i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
p03295_B,03295,B,that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
p03296_B,03296,B,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p03297_B,03297,B,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p03298_B,03298,B,yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage
p03299_B,03299,B,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p03300_B,03300,B,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever
p03301_B,03301,B,yes indeed i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all
p03302_B,03302,B,indeed mama you are mistaken you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true
p03303_B,03303,B,certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter
p03304_B,03304,B,did charlotte dine with you
p03305_B,03305,B,no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend
p03306_B,03306,B,she seems a very pleasant young woman
p03307_B,03307,B,oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were
p03308_B,03308,B,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
p03309_B,03309,B,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p03310_B,03310,B,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
p03311_B,03311,B,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p03312_B,03312,B,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p03313_B,03313,B,how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter you write uncommonly fast
p03314_B,03314,B,you are mistaken i write rather slowly
p03315_B,03315,B,how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them
p03316_B,03316,B,it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours
p03317_B,03317,B,pray tell your sister that i long to see her
p03318_B,03318,B,i have already told her so once by your desire
p03319_B,03319,B,i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well
p03320_B,03320,B,thank you but i always mend my own
p03321_B,03321,B,how can you contrive to write so even tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s
p03322_B,03322,B,will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice
p03323_B,03323,B,oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy
p03324_B,03324,B,they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine
p03325_B,03325,B,it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill
p03326_B,03326,B,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p03327_B,03327,B,my style of writing is very different from yours
p03328_B,03328,B,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p03329_B,03329,B,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p03330_B,03330,B,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p03331_B,03331,B,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast
p03332_B,03332,B,and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
p03333_B,03333,B,the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else
p03334_B,03334,B,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
p03335_B,03335,B,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month
p03336_B,03336,B,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself
p03337_B,03337,B,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could
p03338_B,03338,B,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
p03339_B,03339,B,upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself
p03340_B,03340,B,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
p03341_B,03341,B,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you
p03342_B,03342,B,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either
p03343_B,03343,B,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
p03344_B,03344,B,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties
p03345_B,03345,B,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do
p03346_B,03346,B,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this
p03347_B,03347,B,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
p03348_B,03348,B,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter
p03349_B,03349,B,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel
p03350_B,03350,B,oh i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare
p03351_B,03351,B,indeed i do not dare
p03352_B,03352,B,have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity
p03353_B,03353,B,oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes
p03354_B,03354,B,i did not know that you intended to walk
p03355_B,03355,B,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out
p03356_B,03356,B,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue
p03357_B,03357,B,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye
p03358_B,03358,B,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure
p03359_B,03359,B,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
p03360_B,03360,B,i should like balls infinitely better if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day
p03361_B,03361,B,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball
p03362_B,03362,B,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude
p03363_B,03363,B,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
p03364_B,03364,B,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
p03365_B,03365,B,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done
p03366_B,03366,B,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself
p03367_B,03367,B,mr darcy is not to be laughed at that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh
p03368_B,03368,B,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
p03369_B,03369,B,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without
p03370_B,03370,B,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule
p03371_B,03371,B,such as vanity and pride
p03372_B,03372,B,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
p03373_B,03373,B,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p03374_B,03374,B,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise
p03375_B,03375,B,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
p03376_B,03376,B,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me
p03377_B,03377,B,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome
p03378_B,03378,B,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body
p03379_B,03379,B,and yours is wilfully to misunderstand them
p03380_B,03380,B,do let us have a little music louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst
p03381_B,03381,B,who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home
p03382_B,03382,B,the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger
p03383_B,03383,B,a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment
p03384_B,03384,B,it is not mr bingley it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases
p03385_B,03385,B,oh my dear i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it
p03386_B,03386,B,it certainly is a most iniquitous affair and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself
p03387_B,03387,B,no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him
p03388_B,03388,B,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
p03389_B,03389,B,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him
p03390_B,03390,B,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p03391_B,03391,B,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p03392_B,03392,B,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p03393_B,03393,B,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed
p03394_B,03394,B,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly
p03395_B,03395,B,you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate
p03396_B,03396,B,ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed
p03397_B,03397,B,i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted
p03398_B,03398,B,that is all very proper and civil i am sure and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir
p03399_B,03399,B,the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence
p03400_B,03400,B,i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family
p03401_B,03401,B,she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property
p03402_B,03402,B,ah then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome
p03403_B,03403,B,she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
p03404_B,03404,B,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
p03405_B,03405,B,her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay
p03406_B,03406,B,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p03407_B,03407,B,they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible
p03408_B,03408,B,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p03409_B,03409,B,i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin
p03410_B,03410,B,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
p03411_B,03411,B,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life
p03412_B,03412,B,about a month he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand
p03413_B,03413,B,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
p03414_B,03414,B,as much as i ever wish to be i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable
p03415_B,03415,B,i have no right to give my opinion as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family
p03416_B,03416,B,upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one
p03417_B,03417,B,i cannot pretend to be sorry that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen
p03418_B,03418,B,i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man
p03419_B,03419,B,i wonder whether he is likely to be in this country much longer
p03420_B,03420,B,i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood
p03421_B,03421,B,oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father it was the prospect of constant society and good society which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now
p03422_B,03422,B,good heavens but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress
p03423_B,03423,B,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me
p03424_B,03424,B,this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced
p03425_B,03425,B,some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him
p03426_B,03426,B,but what can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly
p03427_B,03427,B,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me
p03428_B,03428,B,i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful
p03429_B,03429,B,i will not trust myself on the subject i can hardly be just to him
p03430_B,03430,B,to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner
p03431_B,03431,B,we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself
p03432_B,03432,B,how strange how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it
p03433_B,03433,B,it is wonderful for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride
p03434_B,03434,B,can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good
p03435_B,03435,B,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers
p03436_B,03436,B,what sort of a girl is miss darcy
p03437_B,03437,B,i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education
p03438_B,03438,B,i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley
p03439_B,03439,B,not at all
p03440_B,03440,B,he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is
p03441_B,03441,B,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure
p03442_B,03442,B,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long
p03443_B,03443,B,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
p03444_B,03444,B,no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday
p03445_B,03445,B,her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates
p03446_B,03446,B,mr collins speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman
p03447_B,03447,B,i believe her to be both in a great degree i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class
p03448_B,03448,B,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
p03449_B,03449,B,laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no
p03450_B,03450,B,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks
p03451_B,03451,B,it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think
p03452_B,03452,B,i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think
p03453_B,03453,B,heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil
p03454_B,03454,B,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing
p03455_B,03455,B,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible
p03456_B,03456,B,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine
p03457_B,03457,B,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb
p03458_B,03458,B,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly
p03459_B,03459,B,i must not decide on my own performance when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance
p03460_B,03460,B,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain
p03461_B,03461,B,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life
p03462_B,03462,B,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
p03463_B,03463,B,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
p03464_B,03464,B,what think you of books
p03465_B,03465,B,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings
p03466_B,03466,B,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions
p03467_B,03467,B,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else
p03468_B,03468,B,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it
p03469_B,03469,B,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created
p03470_B,03470,B,i am
p03471_B,03471,B,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice
p03472_B,03472,B,i hope not
p03473_B,03473,B,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first
p03474_B,03474,B,may i ask to what these questions tend
p03475_B,03475,B,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out
p03476_B,03476,B,and what is your success
p03477_B,03477,B,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
p03478_B,03478,B,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either
p03479_B,03479,B,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity
p03480_B,03480,B,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours
p03481_B,03481,B,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself
p03482_B,03482,B,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant
p03483_B,03483,B,insolent girl you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy
p03484_B,03484,B,no i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard
p03485_B,03485,B,mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself
p03486_B,03486,B,no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton
p03487_B,03487,B,this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living
p03488_B,03488,B,he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only
p03489_B,03489,B,i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before
p03490_B,03490,B,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
p03491_B,03491,B,indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself
p03492_B,03492,B,for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing
p03493_B,03493,B,if i were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family
p03494_B,03494,B,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning
p03495_B,03495,B,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs
p03496_B,03496,B,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p03497_B,03497,B,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins
p03498_B,03498,B,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
p03499_B,03499,B,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them
p03500_B,03500,B,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long
p03501_B,03501,B,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation
p03502_B,03502,B,were it certain that lady catherine would think so but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications
p03503_B,03503,B,indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled
p03504_B,03504,B,when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character
p03505_B,03505,B,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one
p03506_B,03506,B,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females
p03507_B,03507,B,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart
p03508_B,03508,B,you are uniformly charming and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable
p03509_B,03509,B,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
p03510_B,03510,B,sir you quite misunderstand me lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure
p03511_B,03511,B,i have not the pleasure of understanding you of what are you talking
p03512_B,03512,B,of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy
p03513_B,03513,B,and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business
p03514_B,03514,B,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him
p03515_B,03515,B,let her be called down she shall hear my opinion
p03516_B,03516,B,i have sir
p03517_B,03517,B,very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet
p03518_B,03518,B,yes or i will never see her again
p03519_B,03519,B,an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do
p03520_B,03520,B,what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him
p03521_B,03521,B,my dear i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be
p03522_B,03522,B,my dear madam let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise
p03523_B,03523,B,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
p03524_B,03524,B,caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you it is evident by this that he comes back no more this winter
p03525_B,03525,B,it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should
p03526_B,03526,B,why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject
p03527_B,03527,B,yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it
p03528_B,03528,B,most willingly
p03529_B,03529,B,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend
p03530_B,03530,B,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself
p03531_B,03531,B,that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer
p03532_B,03532,B,but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere
p03533_B,03533,B,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him
p03534_B,03534,B,how can you talk so you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate
p03535_B,03535,B,i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion
p03536_B,03536,B,but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months
p03537_B,03537,B,it keeps him in good humour and i am more obliged to you than i can express
p03538_B,03538,B,but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness
p03539_B,03539,B,my dear sir i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence
p03540_B,03540,B,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
p03541_B,03541,B,believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth
p03542_B,03542,B,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
p03543_B,03543,B,why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you i see what you are feeling you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state
p03544_B,03544,B,indeed mr bennet it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it
p03545_B,03545,B,my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor
p03546_B,03546,B,i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it
p03547_B,03547,B,what should not you mind
p03548_B,03548,B,i should not mind any thing at all
p03549_B,03549,B,let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility
p03550_B,03550,B,i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else
p03551_B,03551,B,i leave it to yourself to determine
p03552_B,03552,B,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable
p03553_B,03553,B,my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin
p03554_B,03554,B,to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness
p03555_B,03555,B,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does
p03556_B,03556,B,and men take care that they should
p03557_B,03557,B,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine
p03558_B,03558,B,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business
p03559_B,03559,B,and do you impute it to either of those
p03560_B,03560,B,yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can
p03561_B,03561,B,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him
p03562_B,03562,B,yes in conjunction with his friend
p03563_B,03563,B,i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it
p03564_B,03564,B,your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride
p03565_B,03565,B,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood
p03566_B,03566,B,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune
p03567_B,03567,B,true but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it
p03568_B,03568,B,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent
p03569_B,03569,B,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before
p03570_B,03570,B,but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love
p03571_B,03571,B,i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love
p03572_B,03572,B,oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything i hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her
p03573_B,03573,B,and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him
p03574_B,03574,B,so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling
p03575_B,03575,B,she will drop the acquaintance entirely
p03576_B,03576,B,you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father
p03577_B,03577,B,my dear aunt this is being serious indeed
p03578_B,03578,B,yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise
p03579_B,03579,B,well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it
p03580_B,03580,B,elizabeth you are not serious now
p03581_B,03581,B,i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best
p03582_B,03582,B,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him
p03583_B,03583,B,as i did the other day very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied
p03584_B,03584,B,that you certainly shall
p03585_B,03585,B,and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me
p03586_B,03586,B,we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire
p03587_B,03587,B,i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford my father and maria are to come to me in march and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them
p03588_B,03588,B,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary
p03589_B,03589,B,if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think
p03590_B,03590,B,she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her
p03591_B,03591,B,but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune
p03592_B,03592,B,no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor
p03593_B,03593,B,but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event
p03594_B,03594,B,a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we
p03595_B,03595,B,her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling
p03596_B,03596,B,well have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish
p03597_B,03597,B,no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire
p03598_B,03598,B,oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all
p03599_B,03599,B,take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us but perhaps to the lakes
p03600_B,03600,B,my dear dear aunt what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers
p03601_B,03601,B,lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed and a most attentive neighbour
p03602_B,03602,B,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
p03603_B,03603,B,oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment
p03604_B,03604,B,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter
p03605_B,03605,B,la my dear it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small
p03606_B,03606,B,she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in
p03607_B,03607,B,oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in
p03608_B,03608,B,i like her appearance she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife
p03609_B,03609,B,i am the less surprised at what has happened from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon
p03610_B,03610,B,do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved
p03611_B,03611,B,a little
p03612_B,03612,B,oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing
p03613_B,03613,B,one of them does
p03614_B,03614,B,why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s do you draw
p03615_B,03615,B,no not at all
p03616_B,03616,B,what none of you
p03617_B,03617,B,not one
p03618_B,03618,B,that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters
p03619_B,03619,B,my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london
p03620_B,03620,B,has your governess left you
p03621_B,03621,B,we never had any governess
p03622_B,03622,B,no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected
p03623_B,03623,B,compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might
p03624_B,03624,B,aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure said she are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet
p03625_B,03625,B,yes ma am all
p03626_B,03626,B,all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young
p03627_B,03627,B,yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind
p03628_B,03628,B,upon my word you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age
p03629_B,03629,B,with three younger sisters grown up your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it
p03630_B,03630,B,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age
p03631_B,03631,B,i am not one and twenty
p03632_B,03632,B,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
p03633_B,03633,B,my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there
p03634_B,03634,B,we are speaking of music madam
p03635_B,03635,B,of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy i am very glad to hear such a good account of her and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal
p03636_B,03636,B,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p03637_B,03637,B,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house
p03638_B,03638,B,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
p03639_B,03639,B,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
p03640_B,03640,B,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
p03641_B,03641,B,i am not afraid of you
p03642_B,03642,B,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p03643_B,03643,B,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact
p03644_B,03644,B,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
p03645_B,03645,B,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders
p03646_B,03646,B,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
p03647_B,03647,B,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers
p03648_B,03648,B,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p03649_B,03649,B,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done
p03650_B,03650,B,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution
p03651_B,03651,B,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers
p03652_B,03652,B,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
p03653_B,03653,B,perfectly so i thank you
p03654_B,03654,B,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again
p03655_B,03655,B,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing
p03656_B,03656,B,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle
p03657_B,03657,B,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford
p03658_B,03658,B,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object
p03659_B,03659,B,mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife
p03660_B,03660,B,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her
p03661_B,03661,B,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends
p03662_B,03662,B,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles
p03663_B,03663,B,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance
p03664_B,03664,B,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family
p03665_B,03665,B,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far
p03666_B,03666,B,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance
p03667_B,03667,B,you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn are you pleased with kent
p03668_B,03668,B,i did not know before that you ever walked this way
p03669_B,03669,B,i have been making the tour of the park as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther
p03670_B,03670,B,no i should have turned in a moment do you certainly leave kent on saturday
p03671_B,03671,B,yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases
p03672_B,03672,B,and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy
p03673_B,03673,B,he likes to have his own way very well but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence
p03674_B,03674,B,in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for
p03675_B,03675,B,these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like
p03676_B,03676,B,unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do
p03677_B,03677,B,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
p03678_B,03678,B,is this meant for me
p03679_B,03679,B,no that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy
p03680_B,03680,B,are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them
p03681_B,03681,B,i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s
p03682_B,03682,B,oh yes mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
p03683_B,03683,B,care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture
p03684_B,03684,B,what is it you mean
p03685_B,03685,B,it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing
p03686_B,03686,B,you may depend upon my not mentioning it
p03687_B,03687,B,and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer
p03688_B,03688,B,did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference
p03689_B,03689,B,i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady
p03690_B,03690,B,and what arts did he use to separate them
p03691_B,03691,B,he did not talk to me of his own arts he only told me what i have now told you
p03692_B,03692,B,i am thinking of what you have been telling me your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge
p03693_B,03693,B,you are rather disposed to call his interference officious
p03694_B,03694,B,i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case
p03695_B,03695,B,that is not an unnatural surmise but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly there were some very strong objections against the lady
p03696_B,03696,B,to jane herself there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach
p03697_B,03697,B,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation
p03698_B,03698,B,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance
p03699_B,03699,B,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it
p03700_B,03700,B,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself
p03701_B,03701,B,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others
p03702_B,03702,B,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns
p03703_B,03703,B,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him
p03704_B,03704,B,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed
p03705_B,03705,B,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule
p03706_B,03706,B,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own
p03707_B,03707,B,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
p03708_B,03708,B,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter
p03709_B,03709,B,this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood how despicably have i acted i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself
p03710_B,03710,B,i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday
p03711_B,03711,B,why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight
p03712_B,03712,B,but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return
p03713_B,03713,B,oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large
p03714_B,03714,B,you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan
p03715_B,03715,B,mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone
p03716_B,03716,B,my uncle is to send a servant for us
p03717_B,03717,B,oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to
p03718_B,03718,B,i know not miss elizabeth whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other
p03719_B,03719,B,good gracious it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened
p03720_B,03720,B,a great many indeed
p03721_B,03721,B,we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell
p03722_B,03722,B,and how much i shall have to conceal
p03723_B,03723,B,are they indeed
p03724_B,03724,B,they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have
p03725_B,03725,B,yes that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton
p03726_B,03726,B,and mary king is safe safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune
p03727_B,03727,B,she is a great fool for going away if she liked him
p03728_B,03728,B,but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side
p03729_B,03729,B,i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing how nicely we are crammed in i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter
p03730_B,03730,B,oh mary i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off
p03731_B,03731,B,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book
p03732_B,03732,B,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him
p03733_B,03733,B,blame you oh no
p03734_B,03734,B,but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham
p03735_B,03735,B,no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did
p03736_B,03736,B,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse
p03737_B,03737,B,i do not know when i have been more shocked wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so
p03738_B,03738,B,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather
p03739_B,03739,B,poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner
p03740_B,03740,B,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it
p03741_B,03741,B,i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do
p03742_B,03742,B,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty
p03743_B,03743,B,lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now
p03744_B,03744,B,indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you
p03745_B,03745,B,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved
p03746_B,03746,B,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character
p03747_B,03747,B,surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion
p03748_B,03748,B,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it
p03749_B,03749,B,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate
p03750_B,03750,B,and then if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value
p03751_B,03751,B,i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more
p03752_B,03752,B,oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done well lizzy and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say
p03753_B,03753,B,no nothing at all
p03754_B,03754,B,a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens
p03755_B,03755,B,it was a subject which they could not mention before me
p03756_B,03756,B,no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me
p03757_B,03757,B,i am sure i shall break mine
p03758_B,03758,B,if one could but go to brighton
p03759_B,03759,B,oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable
p03760_B,03760,B,and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
p03761_B,03761,B,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
p03762_B,03762,B,already arisen what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly
p03763_B,03763,B,indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace
p03764_B,03764,B,do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life
p03765_B,03765,B,nearly three weeks
p03766_B,03766,B,and you saw him frequently
p03767_B,03767,B,yes almost every day
p03768_B,03768,B,his manners are very different from his cousin s
p03769_B,03769,B,yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance
p03770_B,03770,B,indeed and pray may i ask is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope that he is improved in essentials
p03771_B,03771,B,oh no in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood
p03772_B,03772,B,you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart
p03773_B,03773,B,but it is fortunate that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation but surely i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
p03774_B,03774,B,and of this place i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them
p03775_B,03775,B,i have heard much of your master s fine person it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not
p03776_B,03776,B,does that young lady know mr darcy
p03777_B,03777,B,a little
p03778_B,03778,B,and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am
p03779_B,03779,B,yes very handsome
p03780_B,03780,B,i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them
p03781_B,03781,B,and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother
p03782_B,03782,B,oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him
p03783_B,03783,B,is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
p03784_B,03784,B,not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
p03785_B,03785,B,except when she goes to ramsgate
p03786_B,03786,B,yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him
p03787_B,03787,B,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p03788_B,03788,B,i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old
p03789_B,03789,B,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p03790_B,03790,B,yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world
p03791_B,03791,B,can this be mr darcy
p03792_B,03792,B,yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor he is the best landlord and the best master that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
p03793_B,03793,B,in what an amiable light does this place him
p03794_B,03794,B,perhaps we might be deceived
p03795_B,03795,B,that is not very likely our authority was too good
p03796_B,03796,B,he is certainly a good brother
p03797_B,03797,B,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her
p03798_B,03798,B,delightful charming
p03799_B,03799,B,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton
p03800_B,03800,B,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming
p03801_B,03801,B,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it
p03802_B,03802,B,i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
p03803_B,03803,B,to be sure lizzy he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable
p03804_B,03804,B,but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds
p03805_B,03805,B,from what we have seen of him i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue
p03806_B,03806,B,yes but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
p03807_B,03807,B,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill
p03808_B,03808,B,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now
p03809_B,03809,B,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain
p03810_B,03810,B,oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland
p03811_B,03811,B,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her
p03812_B,03812,B,my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake
p03813_B,03813,B,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day
p03814_B,03814,B,oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long
p03815_B,03815,B,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled
p03816_B,03816,B,that is all settled
p03817_B,03817,B,do you really think so
p03818_B,03818,B,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p03819_B,03819,B,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case
p03820_B,03820,B,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland
p03821_B,03821,B,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road
p03822_B,03822,B,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland
p03823_B,03823,B,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter
p03824_B,03824,B,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage
p03825_B,03825,B,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman
p03826_B,03826,B,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
p03827_B,03827,B,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating
p03828_B,03828,B,and do you really know all this
p03829_B,03829,B,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her
p03830_B,03830,B,but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand
p03831_B,03831,B,oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts
p03832_B,03832,B,when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other
p03833_B,03833,B,not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites
p03834_B,03834,B,is my father in town
p03835_B,03835,B,yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word
p03836_B,03836,B,and have you heard from him often
p03837_B,03837,B,we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention
p03838_B,03838,B,and my mother how is she how are you all
p03839_B,03839,B,my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well
p03840_B,03840,B,but you how are you you look pale how much you must have gone through
p03841_B,03841,B,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done
p03842_B,03842,B,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all
p03843_B,03843,B,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever
p03844_B,03844,B,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey
p03845_B,03845,B,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself
p03846_B,03846,B,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before
p03847_B,03847,B,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married
p03848_B,03848,B,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks
p03849_B,03849,B,but not before they went to brighton
p03850_B,03850,B,no i believe not
p03851_B,03851,B,and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character
p03852_B,03852,B,i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false
p03853_B,03853,B,oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened
p03854_B,03854,B,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions
p03855_B,03855,B,could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife
p03856_B,03856,B,he brought it with him for us to see
p03857_B,03857,B,oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it
p03858_B,03858,B,i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion
p03859_B,03859,B,oh jane was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day
p03860_B,03860,B,i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties
p03861_B,03861,B,your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone
p03862_B,03862,B,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us
p03863_B,03863,B,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
p03864_B,03864,B,he meant i believe to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this
p03865_B,03865,B,you must not be too severe upon yourself
p03866_B,03866,B,you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough
p03867_B,03867,B,do you suppose them to be in london
p03868_B,03868,B,yes where else can they be so well concealed
p03869_B,03869,B,and lydia used to want to go to london
p03870_B,03870,B,she is happy then and her residence there will probably be of some duration lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind
p03871_B,03871,B,i am not going to run away papa if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
p03872_B,03872,B,you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner well well do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them
p03873_B,03873,B,what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
p03874_B,03874,B,dear madam don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter
p03875_B,03875,B,oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
p03876_B,03876,B,yes i have had a letter from him by express
p03877_B,03877,B,well and what news does it bring good or bad
p03878_B,03878,B,what is there of good to be expected but perhaps you would like to read it read it aloud for i hardly know myself what it is about
p03879_B,03879,B,then it is as i always hoped they are married
p03880_B,03880,B,is it possible can it be possible that he will marry her
p03881_B,03881,B,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you
p03882_B,03882,B,and have you answered the letter
p03883_B,03883,B,no but it must be done soon
p03884_B,03884,B,oh my dear father come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case
p03885_B,03885,B,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p03886_B,03886,B,i dislike it very much but it must be done
p03887_B,03887,B,and may i ask but the terms i suppose must be complied with
p03888_B,03888,B,complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little
p03889_B,03889,B,and they must marry yet he is such a man
p03890_B,03890,B,yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him
p03891_B,03891,B,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p03892_B,03892,B,i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone
p03893_B,03893,B,that is very true though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
p03894_B,03894,B,no wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
p03895_B,03895,B,ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid
p03896_B,03896,B,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds
p03897_B,03897,B,if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt
p03898_B,03898,B,we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten
p03899_B,03899,B,their conduct has been such as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it
p03900_B,03900,B,may we take my uncle s letter to read to her
p03901_B,03901,B,take whatever you like and get away
p03902_B,03902,B,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p03903_B,03903,B,well it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately
p03904_B,03904,B,mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn
p03905_B,03905,B,she is so fond of mrs forster it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment
p03906_B,03906,B,very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i don t at all like your going such a way off must it be so
p03907_B,03907,B,oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all
p03908_B,03908,B,i should like it beyond any thing
p03909_B,03909,B,and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over
p03910_B,03910,B,i thank you for my share of the favour but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
p03911_B,03911,B,lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed
p03912_B,03912,B,no really i think there cannot be too little said on the subject
p03913_B,03913,B,la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well
p03914_B,03914,B,mr darcy
p03915_B,03915,B,oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
p03916_B,03916,B,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p03917_B,03917,B,oh certainly we will ask you no questions
p03918_B,03918,B,thank you for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry
p03919_B,03919,B,not that i shall though and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out
p03920_B,03920,B,you certainly do but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome
p03921_B,03921,B,i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better
p03922_B,03922,B,true are the others coming out
p03923_B,03923,B,i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you
p03924_B,03924,B,yes she did
p03925_B,03925,B,and what did she say
p03926_B,03926,B,that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented
p03927_B,03927,B,certainly i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there
p03928_B,03928,B,perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year
p03929_B,03929,B,undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had
p03930_B,03930,B,yes he introduced us to his sister
p03931_B,03931,B,and do you like her
p03932_B,03932,B,very much
p03933_B,03933,B,i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well
p03934_B,03934,B,i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age
p03935_B,03935,B,did you go by the village of kympton
p03936_B,03936,B,i do not recollect that we did
p03937_B,03937,B,i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect
p03938_B,03938,B,how should you have liked making sermons
p03939_B,03939,B,exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent
p03940_B,03940,B,i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron
p03941_B,03941,B,you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember
p03942_B,03942,B,i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly
p03943_B,03943,B,you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it
p03944_B,03944,B,come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind
p03945_B,03945,B,oh lord i don t know not these two or three years perhaps
p03946_B,03946,B,write to me very often my dear
p03947_B,03947,B,as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do
p03948_B,03948,B,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p03949_B,03949,B,i often think that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them
p03950_B,03950,B,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p03951_B,03951,B,it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon
p03952_B,03952,B,you may depend on it for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed
p03953_B,03953,B,yet it is hard that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself
p03954_B,03954,B,no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again tis an etiquette i despise if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again
p03955_B,03955,B,well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him
p03956_B,03956,B,i wish i could say any thing to comfort you but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much
p03957_B,03957,B,some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know
p03958_B,03958,B,la it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr what s his name that tall proud man
p03959_B,03959,B,good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him
p03960_B,03960,B,let me first see how he behaves it will then be early enough for expectation could i expect it to be otherwise yet why did he come
p03961_B,03961,B,the first wish of my heart is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again
p03962_B,03962,B,why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent did he come at all he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teazing teazing man i will think no more about him
p03963_B,03963,B,yes very indifferent indeed oh jane take care
p03964_B,03964,B,my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
p03965_B,03965,B,i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever
p03966_B,03966,B,yes she will remain there till christmas
p03967_B,03967,B,and quite alone have all her friends left her
p03968_B,03968,B,mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks
p03969_B,03969,B,it has been a very agreeable day the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man
p03970_B,03970,B,you are very cruel you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment
p03971_B,03971,B,how hard it is in some cases to be believed
p03972_B,03972,B,and how impossible in others
p03973_B,03973,B,but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge
p03974_B,03974,B,that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante
p03975_B,03975,B,we will be down as soon as we can but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago
p03976_B,03976,B,oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear
p03977_B,03977,B,nothing child nothing i did not wink at you come here my love i want to speak to you lizzy my dear i want to speak with you
p03978_B,03978,B,and this is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end
p03979_B,03979,B,with my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare say
p03980_B,03980,B,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p03981_B,03981,B,he has made me so happy by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible
p03982_B,03982,B,i suspected as much but how did he account for it
p03983_B,03983,B,it must have been his sister s doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other
p03984_B,03984,B,that is the most unforgiving speech that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard
p03985_B,03985,B,would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again
p03986_B,03986,B,he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty
p03987_B,03987,B,i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you
p03988_B,03988,B,if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time
p03989_B,03989,B,yes madam she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family
p03990_B,03990,B,you have a very small park here
p03991_B,03991,B,it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s
p03992_B,03992,B,this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west
p03993_B,03993,B,may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well
p03994_B,03994,B,yes very well i saw them the night before last miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company
p03995_B,03995,B,go my dear and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
p03996_B,03996,B,how could i ever think her like her nephew
p03997_B,03997,B,indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here
p03998_B,03998,B,miss bennet you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you
p03999_B,03999,B,if you believed it impossible to be true i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it
p04000_B,04000,B,at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted
p04001_B,04001,B,your coming to longbourn to see me and my family will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence
p04002_B,04002,B,if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad
p04003_B,04003,B,i never heard that it was
p04004_B,04004,B,and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it
p04005_B,04005,B,i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer
p04006_B,04006,B,this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage
p04007_B,04007,B,your ladyship has declared it to be impossible
p04008_B,04008,B,it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in
p04009_B,04009,B,if i have i shall be the last person to confess it
p04010_B,04010,B,miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns
p04011_B,04011,B,but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit
p04012_B,04012,B,let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say
p04013_B,04013,B,only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me
p04014_B,04014,B,the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her s while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin
p04015_B,04015,B,yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him
p04016_B,04016,B,because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us
p04017_B,04017,B,these are heavy misfortunes but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine
p04018_B,04018,B,obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any person s whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment
p04019_B,04019,B,that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me
p04020_B,04020,B,i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up
p04021_B,04021,B,in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal
p04022_B,04022,B,true you are a gentleman s daughter but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition
p04023_B,04023,B,whatever my connections may be if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you
p04024_B,04024,B,tell me once for all are you engaged to him
p04025_B,04025,B,i am not
p04026_B,04026,B,and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement
p04027_B,04027,B,i will make no promise of the kind
p04028_B,04028,B,miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require
p04029_B,04029,B,and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject
p04030_B,04030,B,not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted
p04031_B,04031,B,you can now have nothing farther to say you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house
p04032_B,04032,B,you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody
p04033_B,04033,B,lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments
p04034_B,04034,B,you are then resolved to have him
p04035_B,04035,B,i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me
p04036_B,04036,B,it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world
p04037_B,04037,B,neither duty nor honour nor gratitude have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn
p04038_B,04038,B,and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased
p04039_B,04039,B,she did not choose it she would go
p04040_B,04040,B,she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy
p04041_B,04041,B,if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all
p04042_B,04042,B,from mr collins and what can he have to say
p04043_B,04043,B,something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable are you not diverted
p04044_B,04044,B,oh yes pray read on
p04045_B,04045,B,mr collins moreover adds that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn
p04046_B,04046,B,oh i am excessively diverted but it is so strange
p04047_B,04047,B,yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent
p04048_B,04048,B,mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express
p04049_B,04049,B,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted
p04050_B,04050,B,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them
p04051_B,04051,B,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly
p04052_B,04052,B,yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations
p04053_B,04053,B,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence
p04054_B,04054,B,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility
p04055_B,04055,B,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice
p04056_B,04056,B,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way
p04057_B,04057,B,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me
p04058_B,04058,B,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it
p04059_B,04059,B,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me
p04060_B,04060,B,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies
p04061_B,04061,B,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit
p04062_B,04062,B,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure
p04063_B,04063,B,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased
p04064_B,04064,B,had you then persuaded yourself that i should
p04065_B,04065,B,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses
p04066_B,04066,B,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening
p04067_B,04067,B,hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction
p04068_B,04068,B,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming
p04069_B,04069,B,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise
p04070_B,04070,B,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due
p04071_B,04071,B,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you
p04072_B,04072,B,i must ask whether you were surprised
p04073_B,04073,B,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen
p04074_B,04074,B,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much
p04075_B,04075,B,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together
p04076_B,04076,B,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring
p04077_B,04077,B,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection
p04078_B,04078,B,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him
p04079_B,04079,B,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now
p04080_B,04080,B,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged
p04081_B,04081,B,oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him
p04082_B,04082,B,you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself
p04083_B,04083,B,good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him
p04084_B,04084,B,there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother
p04085_B,04085,B,very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do
p04086_B,04086,B,oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all
p04087_B,04087,B,what do you mean
p04088_B,04088,B,why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry
p04089_B,04089,B,my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him
p04090_B,04090,B,it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley
p04091_B,04091,B,now i am quite happy for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you
p04092_B,04092,B,i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view
p04093_B,04093,B,it may do very well for the others but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty
p04094_B,04094,B,i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience
p04095_B,04095,B,have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference
p04096_B,04096,B,none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him
p04097_B,04097,B,i do i do like him i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms
p04098_B,04098,B,lizzy i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about well my dear i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure
p04099_B,04099,B,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place
p04100_B,04100,B,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun
p04101_B,04101,B,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence
p04102_B,04102,B,for the liveliness of your mind i did
p04103_B,04103,B,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love
p04104_B,04104,B,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield
p04105_B,04105,B,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me
p04106_B,04106,B,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement
p04107_B,04107,B,but i was embarrassed
p04108_B,04108,B,and so was i
p04109_B,04109,B,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner
p04110_B,04110,B,a man who had felt less might
p04111_B,04111,B,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do
p04112_B,04112,B,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing
p04113_B,04113,B,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence
p04114_B,04114,B,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made
p04115_B,04115,B,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her
p04116_B,04116,B,i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly
p04117_B,04117,B,and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected
p04118_B,04118,B,he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child
p04119_B,04119,B,he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a new home
p04120_B,04120,B,well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could be restored to our poor little boy
p04121_B,04121,B,why to be sure that would make great difference the time may come when harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition
p04122_B,04122,B,to be sure it would
p04123_B,04123,B,perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes
p04124_B,04124,B,oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters and as it is only half blood but you have such a generous spirit
p04125_B,04125,B,i would not wish to do any thing mean one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little no one at least can think i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardly expect more
p04126_B,04126,B,there is no knowing what they may expect but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do
p04127_B,04127,B,certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds a piece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman
p04128_B,04128,B,to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds
p04129_B,04129,B,that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them something of the annuity kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable
p04130_B,04130,B,to be sure it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in
p04131_B,04131,B,fifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase
p04132_B,04132,B,certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an annuity is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these annuities were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was not her own she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any restriction whatever it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world
p04133_B,04133,B,it is certainly an unpleasant thing to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence
p04134_B,04134,B,undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly it may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses
p04135_B,04135,B,i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father
p04136_B,04136,B,to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year a piece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that they will live so cheap their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it they will be much more able to give you something
p04137_B,04137,B,upon my word i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then
p04138_B,04138,B,certainly but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to norland though the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it
p04139_B,04139,B,that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here
p04140_B,04140,B,yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them
p04141_B,04141,B,i think you will like him when you know more of him
p04142_B,04142,B,like him i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love
p04143_B,04143,B,you may esteem him
p04144_B,04144,B,i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love
p04145_B,04145,B,oh mama how shall we do without her
p04146_B,04146,B,my love it will be scarcely a separation we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion in the world of edward s heart but you look grave marianne do you disapprove your sister s choice
p04147_B,04147,B,perhaps i may consider it with some surprise edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly but yet he is not the kind of young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this i am afraid mama he has no real taste music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mama how spiritless how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it i could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference
p04148_B,04148,B,he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would give him cowper
p04149_B,04149,B,nay mama if he is not to be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference of taste elinor has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him but it would have broke my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require so much he must have all edward s virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm
p04150_B,04150,B,remember my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness why should you be less fortunate than your mother in one circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be different from hers
p04151_B,04151,B,what a pity it is elinor that edward should have no taste for drawing
p04152_B,04152,B,no taste for drawing why should you think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well he distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right i hope marianne you do not consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him
p04153_B,04153,B,do not be offended elinor if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable
p04154_B,04154,B,i am sure that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly of his sense and his goodness no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his minuter propensities as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the expression of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you marianne
p04155_B,04155,B,i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do in his heart
p04156_B,04156,B,i do not attempt to deny that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him
p04157_B,04157,B,esteem him like him cold hearted elinor oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment
p04158_B,04158,B,excuse me and be assured that i meant no offence to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings believe them to be stronger than i have declared believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicion the hope of his affection for me may warrant without imprudence or folly but farther than this you must not believe i am by no means assured of his regard for me there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is in my heart i feel little scarcely any doubt of his preference but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank
p04159_B,04159,B,and you really are not engaged to him yet it certainly soon will happen but two advantages will proceed from this delay i shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity oh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself how delightful it would be
p04160_B,04160,B,it is but a cottage but i hope to see many of my friends in it a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find none in accommodating them
p04161_B,04161,B,but at least mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it intentionally ill natured colonel brandon is certainly younger than mrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long outlived every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him
p04162_B,04162,B,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p04163_B,04163,B,did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life
p04164_B,04164,B,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p04165_B,04165,B,mama you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony
p04166_B,04166,B,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her
p04167_B,04167,B,a woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other
p04168_B,04168,B,it would be impossible i know to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders
p04169_B,04169,B,but he talked of flannel waistcoats and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble
p04170_B,04170,B,had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever
p04171_B,04171,B,mama i have an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure edward ferrars is not well we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay what else can detain him at norland
p04172_B,04172,B,had you any idea of his coming so soon i had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor expect him already
p04173_B,04173,B,i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must
p04174_B,04174,B,i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time
p04175_B,04175,B,how strange this is what can be the meaning of it but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable how cold how composed were their last adieus how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together in edward s farewell there was no distinction between elinor and me it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room and elinor in quitting norland and edward cried not as i did even now her self command is invariable when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try to avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it
p04176_B,04176,B,you know him then
p04177_B,04177,B,know him to be sure i do why he is down here every year
p04178_B,04178,B,and what sort of a young man is he
p04179_B,04179,B,as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england
p04180_B,04180,B,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p04181_B,04181,B,upon my soul i do not know much about him as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer i ever saw was she out with him today
p04182_B,04182,B,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p04183_B,04183,B,yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in somersetshire besides and if i were you i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself brandon will be jealous if she does not take care
p04184_B,04184,B,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p04185_B,04185,B,he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight o clock till four without once sitting down
p04186_B,04186,B,did he indeed and with elegance with spirit
p04187_B,04187,B,yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert
p04188_B,04188,B,that is what i like that is what a young man ought to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue
p04189_B,04189,B,aye aye i see how it will be i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor brandon
p04190_B,04190,B,that is an expression sir john which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one s cap at a man or making a conquest are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity
p04191_B,04191,B,ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles
p04192_B,04192,B,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p04193_B,04193,B,elinor is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared
p04194_B,04194,B,my love you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
p04195_B,04195,B,that is exactly what i think of him
p04196_B,04196,B,do not boast of it however for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him
p04197_B,04197,B,that he is patronised by you is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else
p04198_B,04198,B,but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust
p04199_B,04199,B,in defence of your prot g you can even be saucy
p04200_B,04200,B,my prot g as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature
p04201_B,04201,B,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p04202_B,04202,B,he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed
p04203_B,04203,B,perhaps his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins
p04204_B,04204,B,i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him
p04205_B,04205,B,i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body s good word and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year
p04206_B,04206,B,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p04207_B,04207,B,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart
p04208_B,04208,B,miss dashwood you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
p04209_B,04209,B,no her opinions are all romantic
p04210_B,04210,B,or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist
p04211_B,04211,B,i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself
p04212_B,04212,B,this will probably be the case and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions
p04213_B,04213,B,i cannot agree with you there there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne s which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage
p04214_B,04214,B,does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives
p04215_B,04215,B,upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable
p04216_B,04216,B,this cannot hold but a change a total change of sentiments no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an enforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances
p04217_B,04217,B,you have said so almost every day since they first met on high church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle
p04218_B,04218,B,but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair
p04219_B,04219,B,take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his
p04220_B,04220,B,but indeed elinor it is marianne s i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you and mama went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket book
p04221_B,04221,B,remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them
p04222_B,04222,B,i never had any conjectures about it it was you who told me of it yourself
p04223_B,04223,B,oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it what is the gentleman s name
p04224_B,04224,B,i must not tell ma am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too
p04225_B,04225,B,yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say
p04226_B,04226,B,no that he is not he is of no profession at all
p04227_B,04227,B,margaret you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence
p04228_B,04228,B,well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f
p04229_B,04229,B,i hope he has had no bad news it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly
p04230_B,04230,B,no bad news colonel i hope
p04231_B,04231,B,none at all ma am i thank you
p04232_B,04232,B,was it from avignon i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse
p04233_B,04233,B,no ma am it came from town and is merely a letter of business
p04234_B,04234,B,but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a letter of business come come this won t do colonel so let us hear the truth of it
p04235_B,04235,B,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p04236_B,04236,B,perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married
p04237_B,04237,B,no indeed it is not
p04238_B,04238,B,well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well
p04239_B,04239,B,whom do you mean ma am
p04240_B,04240,B,oh you know who i mean
p04241_B,04241,B,i am particularly sorry ma am that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town
p04242_B,04242,B,in town what can you have to do in town at this time of year
p04243_B,04243,B,my own loss is great in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell
p04244_B,04244,B,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p04245_B,04245,B,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p04246_B,04246,B,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p04247_B,04247,B,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p04248_B,04248,B,you would not be six hours later if you were to defer your journey till our return
p04249_B,04249,B,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p04250_B,04250,B,there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure brandon is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing
p04251_B,04251,B,i have no doubt of it
p04252_B,04252,B,i hope we shall see you at barton as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return
p04253_B,04253,B,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p04254_B,04254,B,oh he must and shall come back if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him
p04255_B,04255,B,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p04256_B,04256,B,i do not want to pry into other men s concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed of you do not go to town on horseback do you
p04257_B,04257,B,no only to honiton i shall then go post
p04258_B,04258,B,well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind
p04259_B,04259,B,i assure you it is not in my power is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood
p04260_B,04260,B,i am afraid none at all
p04261_B,04261,B,then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do
p04262_B,04262,B,come colonel before you go do let us know what you are going about
p04263_B,04263,B,and who is miss williams
p04264_B,04264,B,what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel s my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies
p04265_B,04265,B,where pray
p04266_B,04266,B,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p04267_B,04267,B,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p04268_B,04268,B,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself
p04269_B,04269,B,yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby
p04270_B,04270,B,mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life
p04271_B,04271,B,i am afraid that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety
p04272_B,04272,B,on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure
p04273_B,04273,B,but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct
p04274_B,04274,B,if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby s and
p04275_B,04275,B,if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done
p04276_B,04276,B,perhaps elinor it was rather ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place and it is a charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful it is a corner room and has windows on two sides on one side you look across the bowling green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly fitted up a couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms in england
p04277_B,04277,B,do not be alarmed nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it
p04278_B,04278,B,i am heartily glad of it may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better
p04279_B,04279,B,thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it
p04280_B,04280,B,i am to me it is faultless nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage
p04281_B,04281,B,with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose
p04282_B,04282,B,yes with all and every thing belonging to it in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton
p04283_B,04283,B,i flatter myself that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this
p04284_B,04284,B,there certainly are circumstances which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share how often did i wish when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford you are a good woman your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me
p04285_B,04285,B,shall we see you tomorrow to dinner i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton
p04286_B,04286,B,i hope not it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment
p04287_B,04287,B,to london and are you going this morning
p04288_B,04288,B,almost this moment
p04289_B,04289,B,this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged and her business will not detain you from us long i hope
p04290_B,04290,B,you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth
p04291_B,04291,B,and is mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here
p04292_B,04292,B,you are too good
p04293_B,04293,B,i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination
p04294_B,04294,B,my engagements at present are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy
p04295_B,04295,B,our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor and with how heavy a heart does he travel
p04296_B,04296,B,it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here
p04297_B,04297,B,it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you
p04298_B,04298,B,can you indeed
p04299_B,04299,B,yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say
p04300_B,04300,B,nothing for you have anticipated my answer
p04301_B,04301,B,then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of
p04302_B,04302,B,i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him
p04303_B,04303,B,do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted
p04304_B,04304,B,not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us
p04305_B,04305,B,concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness
p04306_B,04306,B,i want no proof of their affection but of their engagement i do
p04307_B,04307,B,i am perfectly satisfied of both
p04308_B,04308,B,yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them
p04309_B,04309,B,i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister s love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence
p04310_B,04310,B,i confess that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other
p04311_B,04311,B,how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her
p04312_B,04312,B,no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure
p04313_B,04313,B,but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him
p04314_B,04314,B,you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed
p04315_B,04315,B,a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister s wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful
p04316_B,04316,B,i hope not i believe not i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent
p04317_B,04317,B,you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable remember elinor how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john s hands
p04318_B,04318,B,why do you not ask marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially
p04319_B,04319,B,i would not ask such a question for the world supposing it possible that they are not engaged what distress would not such an enquiry inflict at any rate it would be most ungenerous i should never deserve her confidence again after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one i know marianne s heart i know that she dearly loves me and that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible i would not attempt to force the confidence of any one of a child much less because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct
p04320_B,04320,B,months no nor many weeks
p04321_B,04321,B,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p04322_B,04322,B,he has he has i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come
p04323_B,04323,B,have you been lately in sussex
p04324_B,04324,B,i was at norland about a month ago
p04325_B,04325,B,and how does dear dear norland look
p04326_B,04326,B,dear dear norland probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
p04327_B,04327,B,oh with what transporting sensation have i formerly seen them fall how have i delighted as i walked to see them driven in showers about me by the wind what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired now there is no one to regard them they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight
p04328_B,04328,B,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves
p04329_B,04329,B,no my feelings are not often shared not often understood but sometimes they are now edward here is barton valley look up to it and be tranquil if you can look at those hills did you ever see their equals to the left is barton park amongst those woods and plantations you may see the end of the house and there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage
p04330_B,04330,B,it is a beautiful country but these bottoms must be dirty in winter
p04331_B,04331,B,how can you think of dirt with such objects before you
p04332_B,04332,B,because among the rest of the objects before me i see a very dirty lane
p04333_B,04333,B,how strange
p04334_B,04334,B,have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the middletons pleasant people
p04335_B,04335,B,no not all we could not be more unfortunately situated
p04336_B,04336,B,marianne how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr ferrars and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them
p04337_B,04337,B,no nor how many painful moments
p04338_B,04338,B,no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life
p04339_B,04339,B,but how is your fame to be established for famous you must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter
p04340_B,04340,B,i shall not attempt it i have no wish to be distinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall thank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence
p04341_B,04341,B,you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate
p04342_B,04342,B,as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way greatness will not make me so
p04343_B,04343,B,strange that it would what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness
p04344_B,04344,B,grandeur has but little but wealth has much to do with it
p04345_B,04345,B,elinor for shame money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it beyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction as far as mere self is concerned
p04346_B,04346,B,perhaps we may come to the same point your competence and my wealth are very much alike i dare say and without them as the world goes now we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting your ideas are only more noble than mine come what is your competence
p04347_B,04347,B,about eighteen hundred or two thousand a year not more than that
p04348_B,04348,B,two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end
p04349_B,04349,B,and yet two thousand a year is a very moderate income a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands a proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two and hunters cannot be supported on less
p04350_B,04350,B,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p04351_B,04351,B,but most people do
p04352_B,04352,B,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p04353_B,04353,B,oh that they would
p04354_B,04354,B,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p04355_B,04355,B,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p04356_B,04356,B,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p04357_B,04357,B,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p04358_B,04358,B,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes
p04359_B,04359,B,i love to be reminded of the past edward whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books
p04360_B,04360,B,and the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs
p04361_B,04361,B,no edward i should have something else to do with it
p04362_B,04362,B,perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume
p04363_B,04363,B,undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them
p04364_B,04364,B,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p04365_B,04365,B,she is only grown a little more grave than she was
p04366_B,04366,B,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p04367_B,04367,B,why should you think so but gaiety never was a part of my character
p04368_B,04368,B,nor do i think it a part of marianne s i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
p04369_B,04369,B,i believe you are right and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl
p04370_B,04370,B,i have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge
p04371_B,04371,B,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p04372_B,04372,B,no marianne never my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour you must not confound my meaning i am guilty i confess of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention but when have i advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters
p04373_B,04373,B,you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility do you gain no ground
p04374_B,04374,B,quite the contrary
p04375_B,04375,B,my judgment is all on your side of the question but i am afraid my practice is much more on your sister s i never wish to offend but i am so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent when i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness i have frequently thought that i must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company i am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility
p04376_B,04376,B,marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers
p04377_B,04377,B,she knows her own worth too well for false shame shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other if i could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful i should not be shy
p04378_B,04378,B,but you would still be reserved and that is worse
p04379_B,04379,B,reserved am i reserved marianne
p04380_B,04380,B,yes very
p04381_B,04381,B,i do not understand you reserved how in what manner what am i to tell you what can you suppose
p04382_B,04382,B,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p04383_B,04383,B,i am going into the village to see my horses as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall be back again presently
p04384_B,04384,B,i am afraid it is but too true but why should you boast of it
p04385_B,04385,B,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p04386_B,04386,B,it is very true that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning
p04387_B,04387,B,i am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world
p04388_B,04388,B,i never saw you wear a ring before edward is that fanny s hair i remember her promising to give you some but i should have thought her hair had been darker
p04389_B,04389,B,yes it is my sister s hair the setting always casts a different shade on it you know
p04390_B,04390,B,and who knows but you may raise a dance and that will tempt you miss marianne
p04391_B,04391,B,a dance impossible who is to dance
p04392_B,04392,B,who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone
p04393_B,04393,B,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p04394_B,04394,B,and who is willoughby
p04395_B,04395,B,what do you mean
p04396_B,04396,B,shall i tell you
p04397_B,04397,B,oh edward how can you but the time will come i hope i am sure you will like him
p04398_B,04398,B,i do not doubt it
p04399_B,04399,B,i do assure you that i have long thought on this point as you think now it has been and is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me that i have had no necessary business to engage me no profession to give me employment or afford me any thing like independence but unfortunately my own nicety and the nicety of my friends have made me what i am an idle helpless being we never could agree in our choice of a profession i always preferred the church as i still do but that was not smart enough for my family they recommended the army that was a great deal too smart for me the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs but i had no inclination for the law even in this less abstruse study of it which my family approved as for the navy it had fashion on its side but i was too old when the subject was first started to enter it and at length as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all as i might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing i was therefore entered at oxford and have been properly idle ever since
p04400_B,04400,B,the consequence of which i suppose will be since leisure has not promoted your own happiness that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits employments professions and trades as columella s
p04401_B,04401,B,they will be brought up to be as unlike myself as is possible in feeling in action in condition in every thing
p04402_B,04402,B,come come this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits edward you are in a melancholy humour and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy but remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times whatever be their education or state know your own happiness you want nothing but patience or give it a more fascinating name call it hope your mother will secure to you in time that independence you are so anxious for it is her duty and it will it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent how much may not a few months do
p04403_B,04403,B,i think that i may defy many months to produce any good to me
p04404_B,04404,B,hush they will hear you
p04405_B,04405,B,never mind if they do it is only the palmers charlotte is very pretty i can tell you you may see her if you look this way where is marianne has she run away because we are come i see her instrument is open
p04406_B,04406,B,she is walking i believe
p04407_B,04407,B,you may believe how glad we all were to see them but however i can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know it was wrong in her situation i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all she expects to be confined in february
p04408_B,04408,B,no none at all
p04409_B,04409,B,here comes marianne now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
p04410_B,04410,B,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p04411_B,04411,B,why should they ask us the rent of this cottage is said to be low but we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them or with us
p04412_B,04412,B,they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere
p04413_B,04413,B,how horrid all this is such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain it makes one detest all one s acquaintance what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house how few people know what comfort is sir john is as stupid as the weather
p04414_B,04414,B,oh don t be so sly before us for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live a great way from him in the country you know not above ten miles i dare say
p04415_B,04415,B,much nearer thirty
p04416_B,04416,B,ah well there is not much difference i never was at his house but they say it is a sweet pretty place
p04417_B,04417,B,as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life
p04418_B,04418,B,is it very ugly then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose
p04419_B,04419,B,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p04420_B,04420,B,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p04421_B,04421,B,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p04422_B,04422,B,then you would be very ill bred
p04423_B,04423,B,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p04424_B,04424,B,i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred
p04425_B,04425,B,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p04426_B,04426,B,mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour
p04427_B,04427,B,certainly i came into devonshire with no other view
p04428_B,04428,B,there now you see mr palmer expects you so you cannot refuse to come but indeed you must and shall come i am sure you will like it of all things the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now for mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming but poor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced to make every body like him how charming it will be when he is in parliament won t it how i shall laugh it will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an m p but do you know he says he will never frank for me he declares he won t don t you mr palmer he cannot bear writing you know he says it is quite shocking
p04429_B,04429,B,no i never said any thing so irrational don t palm all your abuses of language upon me
p04430_B,04430,B,there now you see how droll he is this is always the way with him sometimes he won t speak to me for half a day together and then he comes out with something so droll all about any thing in the world
p04431_B,04431,B,certainly he seems very agreeable
p04432_B,04432,B,well i am so glad you do i thought you would he is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i can tell you and you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come to cleveland i can t imagine why you should object to it oh dear yes i know him extremely well not that i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he was at allenham mama saw him here once before but i was with my uncle at weymouth however i dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together he is very little at combe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is in the opposition you know and besides it is such a way off i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him i am monstrous glad of it for then i shall have her for a neighbour you know
p04433_B,04433,B,upon my word you know much more of the matter than i do if you have any reason to expect such a match
p04434_B,04434,B,don t pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talks of i assure you i heard of it in my way through town
p04435_B,04435,B,my dear mrs palmer
p04436_B,04436,B,upon my honour i did i met colonel brandon monday morning in bond street just before we left town and he told me of it directly
p04437_B,04437,B,you surprise me very much colonel brandon tell you of it surely you must be mistaken to give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it even if it were true is not what i should expect colonel brandon to do
p04438_B,04438,B,but i do assure you it was so for all that and i will tell you how it happened when we met him he turned back and walked with us and so we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing and another and i said to him so colonel there is a new family come to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very pretty and that one of them is going to be married to mr willoughby of combe magna is it true pray for of course you must know as you have been in devonshire so lately
p04439_B,04439,B,and what did the colonel say
p04440_B,04440,B,oh he did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true so from that moment i set it down as certain it will be quite delightful i declare when is it to take place
p04441_B,04441,B,mr brandon was very well i hope
p04442_B,04442,B,oh yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing but say fine things of you
p04443_B,04443,B,i am flattered by his commendation he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing
p04444_B,04444,B,so do i he is such a charming man that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull mama says he was in love with your sister too i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he hardly ever falls in love with any body
p04445_B,04445,B,is mr willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire
p04446_B,04446,B,oh yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you nobody is more liked than mr willoughby wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister she is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that he is much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing can be good enough for her however i don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i think you both excessively pretty and so does mr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him to own it last night i am so glad we are got acquainted at last and now i hope we shall always be great friends you can t think how much i longed to see you it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage nothing can be like it to be sure and i am so glad your sister is going to be well married i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna it is a sweet place by all accounts
p04447_B,04447,B,you have been long acquainted with colonel brandon have not you
p04448_B,04448,B,yes a great while ever since my sister married he was a particular friend of sir john s i believe he would have been very glad to have had me if he could sir john and lady middleton wished it very much but mama did not think the match good enough for me otherwise sir john would have mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been married immediately
p04449_B,04449,B,did not colonel brandon know of sir john s proposal to your mother before it was made had he never owned his affection to yourself
p04450_B,04450,B,oh no but if mama had not objected to it i dare say he would have liked it of all things he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school however i am much happier as i am mr palmer is the kind of man i like
p04451_B,04451,B,poor little creatures it might have been a very sad accident
p04452_B,04452,B,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p04453_B,04453,B,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p04454_B,04454,B,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p04455_B,04455,B,i should guess so from what i have witnessed this morning
p04456_B,04456,B,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p04457_B,04457,B,i confess that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence
p04458_B,04458,B,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p04459_B,04459,B,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p04460_B,04460,B,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p04461_B,04461,B,and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always
p04462_B,04462,B,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p04463_B,04463,B,nay my dear i m sure i don t pretend to say that there an t i m sure there s a vast many smart beaux in exeter but you know how could i tell what smart beaux there might be about norland and i was only afraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not so many as they used to have but perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil but i can t bear to see them dirty and nasty now there s mr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen i suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich
p04464_B,04464,B,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p04465_B,04465,B,oh dear one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do
p04466_B,04466,B,lord anne you can talk of nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else
p04467_B,04467,B,twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome and i hope you may have as good luck yourself soon but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already
p04468_B,04468,B,ferrars mr ferrars is the happy man is he what your sister in law s brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well
p04469_B,04469,B,how can you say so anne though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well
p04470_B,04470,B,and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted
p04471_B,04471,B,no i know nothing of her
p04472_B,04472,B,i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way but perhaps there may be reasons i wish i might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to be impertinent i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious i am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours and i am sure i should not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars
p04473_B,04473,B,i am sorry i do not if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her but really i never understood that you were at all connected with that family and therefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiry into her character
p04474_B,04474,B,i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it but if i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present but the time may come how soon it will come must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately connected
p04475_B,04475,B,good heavens what do you mean are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars can you be
p04476_B,04476,B,no not to mr robert ferrars i never saw him in my life but to his eldest brother you may well be surprised for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour not a soul of all my relations know of it but anne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars must seem so odd that it ought to be explained and i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted you because i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite as his own sisters
p04477_B,04477,B,may i ask if your engagement is of long standing
p04478_B,04478,B,we have been engaged these four years
p04479_B,04479,B,four years
p04480_B,04480,B,our acquaintance however is of many years date he was under my uncle s care you know a considerable while
p04481_B,04481,B,your uncle
p04482_B,04482,B,yes mr pratt did you never hear him talk of mr pratt
p04483_B,04483,B,i think i have
p04484_B,04484,B,he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple near plymouth it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement was formed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost always with us afterwards i was very unwilling to enter into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother but i was too young and loved him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him
p04485_B,04485,B,certainly engaged to mr edward ferrars i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me that really i beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake of person or name we cannot mean the same mr ferrars
p04486_B,04486,B,we can mean no other mr edward ferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street and brother of your sister in law mrs john dashwood is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends
p04487_B,04487,B,it is strange that i should never have heard him even mention your name
p04488_B,04488,B,no considering our situation it was not strange our first care has been to keep the matter secret you knew nothing of me or my family and therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you and as he was always particularly afraid of his sister s suspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it
p04489_B,04489,B,four years you have been engaged
p04490_B,04490,B,yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait poor edward it puts him quite out of heart to prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look at this face it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for i have had it above these three years i have never been able to give him my picture in return which i am very much vexed at for he has been always so anxious to get it but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity
p04491_B,04491,B,you are quite in the right
p04492_B,04492,B,i am sure i have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is to us not to have it reach his mother for she would never approve of it i dare say i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding proud woman
p04493_B,04493,B,i certainly did not seek your confidence but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on your secret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication you must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety
p04494_B,04494,B,i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with you in telling you all this i have not known you long to be sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by description a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance besides in the present case i really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about edward s mother and i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose advice i can ask anne is the only person that knows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her betraying me she does not know how to hold her tongue as you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the world t other day when edward s name was mentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all you can t think how much i go through in my mind from it altogether i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years every thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a year i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke sometimes i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely but then at other times i have not resolution enough for it i cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of such a thing would do and on my own account too so dear as he is to me i don t think i could be equal to it what would you advise me to do in such a case miss dashwood what would you do yourself
p04495_B,04495,B,pardon me but i can give you no advice under such circumstances your own judgment must direct you
p04496_B,04496,B,to be sure his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it did you not think him dreadful low spirited when he was at barton he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill
p04497_B,04497,B,did he come from your uncle s then when he visited us
p04498_B,04498,B,oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us did you think he came directly from town
p04499_B,04499,B,no i remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth
p04500_B,04500,B,did not you think him sadly out of spirits
p04501_B,04501,B,we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived
p04502_B,04502,B,i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected poor fellow i am afraid it is just the same with him now for he writes in wretched spirits i heard from him just before i left exeter you know his hand i dare say a charming one it is but that is not written so well as usual he was tired i dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible writing to each other is the only comfort we have in such long separations yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even that if he had but my picture he says he should be easy i gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him
p04503_B,04503,B,i did
p04504_B,04504,B,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p04505_B,04505,B,you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done
p04506_B,04506,B,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p04507_B,04507,B,marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard
p04508_B,04508,B,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p04509_B,04509,B,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p04510_B,04510,B,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p04511_B,04511,B,i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again
p04512_B,04512,B,thank you for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday
p04513_B,04513,B,offended me how could you suppose so believe me nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea could you have a motive for the trust that was not honourable and flattering to me
p04514_B,04514,B,and yet i do assure you there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable i felt sure that you was angry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment of my life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i am sure
p04515_B,04515,B,indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it your case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them mr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother
p04516_B,04516,B,he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh i have been always used to a very small income and could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her we must wait it may be for many years with almost every other man in the world it would be an alarming prospect but edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of i know
p04517_B,04517,B,that conviction must be every thing to you and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed
p04518_B,04518,B,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived
p04519_B,04519,B,all this is very pretty but it can impose upon neither of us
p04520_B,04520,B,if we could be certain that it would be only for a while but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert and the idea of that for edward s sake frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures
p04521_B,04521,B,and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason do you know mr robert ferrars
p04522_B,04522,B,not at all i never saw him but i fancy he is very unlike his brother silly and a great coxcomb
p04523_B,04523,B,no sister you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs
p04524_B,04524,B,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p04525_B,04525,B,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p04526_B,04526,B,i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest
p04527_B,04527,B,i should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough to her husband
p04528_B,04528,B,but mrs john dashwood would not much approve of edward s going into orders
p04529_B,04529,B,then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little
p04530_B,04530,B,i believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement we seem so beset with difficulties on every side that though it would make us miserable for a time we should be happier perhaps in the end but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood
p04531_B,04531,B,no on such a subject i certainly will not you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes
p04532_B,04532,B,indeed you wrong me i know nobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours and i do really believe that if you was to say to me i should resolve upon doing it immediately
p04533_B,04533,B,this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had i formed one it raises my influence much too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person
p04534_B,04534,B,tis because you are an indifferent person that your judgment might justly have such weight with me if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood
p04535_B,04535,B,certainly not
p04536_B,04536,B,i am sorry for that it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there but i dare say you will go for all that to be sure your brother and sister will ask you to come to them
p04537_B,04537,B,it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do
p04538_B,04538,B,how unlucky that is i had quite depended upon meeting you there anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years but i only go for the sake of seeing edward he will be there in february otherwise london would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it
p04539_B,04539,B,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it
p04540_B,04540,B,nay i am sure i shall be monstrous glad of miss marianne s company whether miss dashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i and i thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together because if they got tired of me they might talk to one another and laugh at my odd ways behind my back but one or the other if not both of them i must have lord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself i who have been always used till this winter to have charlotte with me come miss marianne let us strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her mind by and bye why so much the better
p04541_B,04541,B,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
p04542_B,04542,B,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed
p04543_B,04543,B,and what is my dear prudent elinor going to suggest what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward do not let me hear a word about the expense of it
p04544_B,04544,B,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence
p04545_B,04545,B,that is very true but of her society separately from that of other people you will scarcely have any thing at all and you will almost always appear in public with lady middleton
p04546_B,04546,B,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p04547_B,04547,B,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family
p04548_B,04548,B,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
p04549_B,04549,B,i am not going to write to my mother oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is
p04550_B,04550,B,i had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmer s where i have been dining
p04551_B,04551,B,oh you did well and how do they all do at their house how does charlotte do i warrant you she is a fine size by this time
p04552_B,04552,B,mrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned to tell you that you will certainly see her to morrow
p04553_B,04553,B,ay to be sure i thought as much well colonel i have brought two young ladies with me you see that is you see but one of them now but there is another somewhere your friend miss marianne too which you will not be sorry to hear i do not know what you and mr willoughby will do between you about her ay it is a fine thing to be young and handsome well i was young once but i never was very handsome worse luck for me however i got a very good husband and i don t know what the greatest beauty can do more ah poor man he has been dead these eight years and better but colonel where have you been to since we parted and how does your business go on come come let s have no secrets among friends
p04554_B,04554,B,has no letter been left here for me since we went out are you quite sure of it are you certain that no servant no porter has left any letter or note how very odd
p04555_B,04555,B,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne
p04556_B,04556,B,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight
p04557_B,04557,B,at any rate i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week
p04558_B,04558,B,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p04559_B,04559,B,and now she will write to combe by this day s post
p04560_B,04560,B,depend upon it he will call again tomorrow
p04561_B,04561,B,for me
p04562_B,04562,B,it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking
p04563_B,04563,B,you are expecting a letter then
p04564_B,04564,B,yes a little not much
p04565_B,04565,B,you have no confidence in me marianne
p04566_B,04566,B,nay elinor this reproach from you you who have confidence in no one
p04567_B,04567,B,me indeed marianne i have nothing to tell
p04568_B,04568,B,nor i our situations then are alike we have neither of us any thing to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing
p04569_B,04569,B,did you
p04570_B,04570,B,when do you go back again
p04571_B,04571,B,i do not know
p04572_B,04572,B,it cannot be generally known for her own family do not know it
p04573_B,04573,B,i beg your pardon i am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not supposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond and their marriage is universally talked of
p04574_B,04574,B,how can that be by whom can you have heard it mentioned
p04575_B,04575,B,by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sister s writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her
p04576_B,04576,B,pray pray be composed and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet
p04577_B,04577,B,good god willoughby what is the meaning of this have you not received my letters will you not shake hands with me
p04578_B,04578,B,i did myself the honour of calling in berkeley street last tuesday and very much regretted that i was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings at home my card was not lost i hope
p04579_B,04579,B,but have you not received my notes here is some mistake i am sure some dreadful mistake what can be the meaning of it tell me willoughby for heaven s sake tell me what is the matter
p04580_B,04580,B,yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me
p04581_B,04581,B,go to him elinor and force him to come to me tell him i must see him again must speak to him instantly i cannot rest i shall not have a moment s peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other oh go to him this moment
p04582_B,04582,B,how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not the place for explanations wait only till tomorrow marianne may i ask
p04583_B,04583,B,no elinor ask nothing you will soon know all
p04584_B,04584,B,and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married
p04585_B,04585,B,for shame for shame miss dashwood how can you talk so don t we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met did not i see them together in devonshire every day and all day long and did not i know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes come come this won t do because you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you for it has been known all over town this ever so long i tell every body of it and so does charlotte
p04586_B,04586,B,indeed ma am you are mistaken indeed you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now
p04587_B,04587,B,i only wish there were any thing i could do which might be of comfort to you
p04588_B,04588,B,oh elinor i am miserable indeed
p04589_B,04589,B,exert yourself dear marianne if you would not kill yourself and all who love you think of your mother think of her misery while you suffer for her sake you must exert yourself
p04590_B,04590,B,i cannot i cannot leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me but do not torture me so oh how easy for those who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion happy happy elinor you cannot have an idea of what i suffer
p04591_B,04591,B,do you call me happy marianne ah if you knew and can you believe me to be so while i see you so wretched
p04592_B,04592,B,forgive me forgive me i know you feel for me i know what a heart you have but yet you are you must be happy edward loves you what oh what can do away such happiness as that
p04593_B,04593,B,many many circumstances
p04594_B,04594,B,no no no he loves you and only you you can have no grief
p04595_B,04595,B,i can have no pleasure while i see you in this state
p04596_B,04596,B,and you will never see me otherwise mine is a misery which nothing can do away
p04597_B,04597,B,you must not talk so marianne have you no comforts no friends is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation much as you suffer now think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months as it might have been before he chose to put an end to it every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful
p04598_B,04598,B,engagement there has been no engagement
p04599_B,04599,B,no engagement
p04600_B,04600,B,no he is not so unworthy as you believe him he has broken no faith with me
p04601_B,04601,B,but he told you that he loved you
p04602_B,04602,B,yes no never absolutely it was every day implied but never professedly declared sometimes i thought it had been but it never was
p04603_B,04603,B,yet you wrote to him
p04604_B,04604,B,yes could that be wrong after all that had passed but i cannot talk i felt myself to be as solemnly engaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other
p04605_B,04605,B,i can believe it but unfortunately he did not feel the same
p04606_B,04606,B,he did feel the same elinor for weeks and weeks he felt it i know he did whatever may have changed him now and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish this lock of hair which now he can so readily give up was begged of me with the most earnest supplication had you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice at that moment have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton the morning that we parted too when he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can i ever forget his distress elinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby
p04607_B,04607,B,dearest marianne who but himself by whom can he have been instigated
p04608_B,04608,B,by all the world rather than by his own heart i could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe his nature capable of such cruelty this woman of whom he writes whoever she be or any one in short but your own dear self mama and edward may have been so barbarous to bely me beyond you three is there a creature in the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil than willoughby whose heart i know so well
p04609_B,04609,B,whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence
p04610_B,04610,B,no no misery such as mine has no pride i care not who knows that i am wretched the triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but i cannot i must feel i must be wretched and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can
p04611_B,04611,B,but for my mother s sake and mine
p04612_B,04612,B,i would do more than for my own but to appear happy when i am so miserable oh who can require it it is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours cruel cruel nothing can acquit you elinor nothing can whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to have told me of it to have given me the power of clearing myself that is unpardonable willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words oh barbarously insolent elinor can he be justified
p04613_B,04613,B,no marianne in no possible way
p04614_B,04614,B,and yet this woman who knows what her art may have been how long it may have been premeditated and how deeply contrived by her who is she who can she be whom did i ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance oh no one no one he talked to me only of myself elinor i must go home i must go and comfort mama can not we be gone to morrow
p04615_B,04615,B,to morrow marianne
p04616_B,04616,B,yes why should i stay here i came only for willoughby s sake and now who cares for me who regards me
p04617_B,04617,B,it would be impossible to go to morrow we owe mrs jennings much more than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that
p04618_B,04618,B,well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people the middletons and palmers how am i to bear their pity the pity of such a woman as lady middleton oh what would he say to that
p04619_B,04619,B,the lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich
p04620_B,04620,B,fifty thousand pounds my dear did you ever see her a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome i remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married a very wealthy man but the family are all rich together fifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it won t come before it s wanted for they say he is all to pieces no wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters well it don t signify talking but when a young man be who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl and promises marriage he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor and a richer girl is ready to have him why don t he in such a case sell his horses let his house turn off his servants and make a thorough reform at once i warrant you miss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round but that won t do now a days nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age
p04621_B,04621,B,do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is is she said to be amiable
p04622_B,04622,B,i never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever heard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say this morning that one day miss walker hinted to her that she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry to have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could never agree
p04623_B,04623,B,and who are the ellisons
p04624_B,04624,B,her guardians my dear but now she is of age and may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has made what now your poor sister is gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself is there nothing one can get to comfort her poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone well by and by we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little what shall we play at she hates whist i know but is there no round game she cares for
p04625_B,04625,B,dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary marianne i dare say will not leave her room again this evening i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed for i am sure she wants rest
p04626_B,04626,B,aye i believe that will be best for her let her name her own supper and go to bed lord no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two for this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that and so the letter that came today finished it poor soul i am sure if i had had a notion of it i would not have joked her about it for all my money but then you know how should i guess such a thing i made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter and you know young people like to be laughed at about them lord how concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they hear it if i had my senses about me i might have called in conduit street in my way home and told them of it but i shall see them tomorrow
p04627_B,04627,B,it would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution mrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby or making the slightest allusion to what has passed before my sister their own good nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe
p04628_B,04628,B,oh lord yes that i do indeed it must be terrible for you to hear it talked of and as for your sister i am sure i would not mention a word about it to her for the world you saw i did not all dinner time no more would sir john nor my daughters for they are all very thoughtful and considerate especially if i give them a hint as i certainly will for my part i think the less that is said about such things the better the sooner tis blown over and forgot and what good does talking ever do you know
p04629_B,04629,B,in this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it has been attended by circumstances which for the sake of every one concerned in it make it unfit to become the public conversation i must do this justice to mr willoughby he has broken no positive engagement with my sister
p04630_B,04630,B,law my dear don t pretend to defend him no positive engagement indeed after taking her all over allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter well my dear tis a true saying about an ill wind for it will be all the better for colonel brandon he will have her at last aye that he will mind me now if they an t married by mid summer lord how he ll chuckle over this news i hope he will come tonight it will be all to one a better match for your sister two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love child indeed aye i had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then what does it signify delaford is a nice place i can tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner lord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there then there is a dove cote some delightful stew ponds and a very pretty canal and every thing in short that one could wish for and moreover it is close to the church and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike road so tis never dull for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house you may see all the carriages that pass along oh tis a nice place a butcher hard by in the village and the parsonage house within a stone s throw to my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park where they are forced to send three miles for their meat and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother well i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down if we can but put willoughby out of her head
p04631_B,04631,B,ay if we can do that ma am we shall do very well with or without colonel brandon
p04632_B,04632,B,i will leave you if you will go to bed
p04633_B,04633,B,dear ma am how good you are but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope almost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest if you will give me leave i will drink the wine myself
p04634_B,04634,B,the colonel looks as grave as ever you see he knows nothing of it do tell him my dear
p04635_B,04635,B,marianne is not well she has been indisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed
p04636_B,04636,B,perhaps then what i heard this morning may be there may be more truth in it than i could believe possible at first
p04637_B,04637,B,what did you hear
p04638_B,04638,B,that a gentleman whom i had reason to think in short that a man whom i knew to be engaged but how shall i tell you if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared
p04639_B,04639,B,you mean mr willoughby s marriage with miss grey yes we do know it all this seems to have been a day of general elucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us mr willoughby is unfathomable where did you hear it
p04640_B,04640,B,in a stationer s shop in pall mall where i had business two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match in a voice so little attempting concealment that it was impossible for me not to hear all the name of willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated first caught my attention and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with miss grey it was no longer to be a secret it would take place even within a few weeks with many particulars of preparations and other matters one thing especially i remember because it served to identify the man still more as soon as the ceremony was over they were to go to combe magna his seat in somersetshire my astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what i felt the communicative lady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop till they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i have been since informed is the name of miss grey s guardian
p04641_B,04641,B,it is but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds in that if in any thing we may find an explanation
p04642_B,04642,B,it may be so but willoughby is capable at least i think and your sister how did she
p04643_B,04643,B,her sufferings have been very severe i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short it has been it is a most cruel affliction till yesterday i believe she never doubted his regard and even now perhaps but i am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her he has been very deceitful and in some points there seems a hardness of heart about him
p04644_B,04644,B,ah there is indeed but your sister does not i think you said so she does not consider quite as you do
p04645_B,04645,B,you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could
p04646_B,04646,B,who can this be so early too i thought we had been safe
p04647_B,04647,B,it is colonel brandon we are never safe from him
p04648_B,04648,B,he will not come in as mrs jennings is from home
p04649_B,04649,B,i will not trust to that a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others
p04650_B,04650,B,i understand you you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it
p04651_B,04651,B,you shall and to be brief when i quitted barton last october but this will give you no idea i must go farther back you will find me a very awkward narrator miss dashwood i hardly know where to begin a short account of myself i believe will be necessary and it shall be a short one on such a subject can i have little temptation to be diffuse you have probably entirely forgotten a conversation it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you a conversation between us one evening at barton park it was the evening of a dance in which i alluded to a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure your sister marianne
p04652_B,04652,B,indeed i have not forgotten it
p04653_B,04653,B,if i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality of tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance between them as well in mind as person the same warmth of heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits this lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from her infancy and under the guardianship of my father our ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt hers for me was i believe fervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby and it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate at seventeen she was lost to me for ever she was married married against her inclination to my brother her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian my brother did not deserve her he did not even love her i had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty and for some time it did but at last the misery of her situation for she experienced great unkindness overcame all her resolution and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly i relate i have never told you how this was brought on we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us i was banished to the house of a relation far distant and she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement till my father s point was gained i had depended on her fortitude too far and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy so young as i then was a few months must have reconciled me to it or at least i should not have now to lament it this however was not the case my brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what they ought to have been and from the first he treated her unkindly the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural she resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned but can we wonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy and without a friend to advise or restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their marriage and i was with my regiment in the east indies she should fall had i remained in england perhaps but i meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years and for that purpose had procured my exchange the shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight was nothing to what i felt when i heard about two years afterwards of her divorce it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england my first care when i did arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy i could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person he imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her regard for a former servant of my own who had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit him in a spunging house where he was confined for debt and there in the same house under a similar confinement was my unfortunate sister so altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me to be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl on whom i had once doted what i endured in so beholding her but i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it i have pained you too much already that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort life could do nothing for her beyond giving time for a better preparation for death and that was given i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings and under proper attendants i visited her every day during the rest of her short life i was with her in her last moments your sister i hope cannot be offended by the resemblance i have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be but to what does all this lead i seem to have been distressing you for nothing ah miss dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all i will be more collected more concise she left to my care her only child a little girl the offspring of her first guilty connection who was then about three years old she loved the child and had always kept it with her it was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly would i have discharged it in the strictest sense by watching over her education myself had the nature of our situations allowed it but i had no family no home and my little eliza was therefore placed at school i saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my brother which happened about five years ago and which left to me the possession of the family property she visited me at delaford i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her it is now three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year that i removed her from school to place her under the care of a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years i had every reason to be pleased with her situation but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared i had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned out at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of her young friends who was attending her father there for his health i knew him to be a very good sort of man and i thought well of his daughter better than she deserved for with a most obstinate and ill judged secrecy she would tell nothing would give no clue though she certainly knew all he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business in short i could learn nothing but that she was gone all the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture what i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i suffered too
p04654_B,04654,B,good heavens could it be could willoughby
p04655_B,04655,B,the first news that reached me of her came in a letter from herself last october it was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it on the very morning of our intended party to whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly which i am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body and which i believe gave offence to some little did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party that i was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable but had he known it what would it have availed would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do he had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of the utmost distress with no creditable home no help no friends ignorant of his address he had left her promising to return he neither returned nor wrote nor relieved her
p04656_B,04656,B,this is beyond every thing
p04657_B,04657,B,his character is now before you expensive dissipated and worse than both knowing all this as i have now known it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured that she was to marry him guess what i must have felt for all your sakes when i came to you last week and found you alone i came determined to know the truth though irresolute what to do when it was known my behaviour must have seemed strange to you then but now you will comprehend it to suffer you all to be so deceived to see your sister but what could i do i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him but now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what were his designs on her whatever they may have been however she may now and hereafter doubtless will turn with gratitude towards her own condition when she compares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl and pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong still as strong as her own and with a mind tormented by self reproach which must attend her through life surely this comparison must have its use with her she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace on the contrary every friend must be made still more her friend by them concern for her unhappiness and respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen every attachment use your own discretion however in communicating to her what i have told you you must know best what will be its effect but had i not seriously and from my heart believed it might be of service might lessen her regrets i would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others
p04658_B,04658,B,i have been more pained by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do now though at first she will suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier have you ever seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton
p04659_B,04659,B,yes once i have one meeting was unavoidable
p04660_B,04660,B,what have you met him to
p04661_B,04661,B,i could meet him no other way eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct we returned unwounded and the meeting therefore never got abroad such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust
p04662_B,04662,B,is she still in town
p04663_B,04663,B,no as soon as she recovered from her lying in for i found her near her delivery i removed her and her child into the country and there she remains
p04664_B,04664,B,well my dear and how did you travel
p04665_B,04665,B,not in the stage i assure you we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did
p04666_B,04666,B,oh oh very pretty indeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you
p04667_B,04667,B,there now everybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i cannot think why my cousins say they are sure i have made a conquest but for my part i declare i never think about him from one hour s end to another nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house said i
p04668_B,04668,B,aye aye that is very pretty talking but it won t do the doctor is the man i see
p04669_B,04669,B,no indeed and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of
p04670_B,04670,B,i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashwood when they come to town
p04671_B,04671,B,no i do not think we shall
p04672_B,04672,B,oh yes i dare say you will what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together
p04673_B,04673,B,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p04674_B,04674,B,i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood i am sorry she is not well
p04675_B,04675,B,you are very good my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation
p04676_B,04676,B,oh dear that is a great pity but such old friends as lucy and me i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word oh if that s all we can just as well go and see her
p04677_B,04677,B,excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express
p04678_B,04678,B,i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed but so it ought to be they are people of large fortune they are related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected and so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing edward brought us a most charming account of the place the most complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it i assure you who is colonel brandon is he a man of fortune
p04679_B,04679,B,yes he has very good property in dorsetshire
p04680_B,04680,B,i am glad of it he seems a most gentlemanlike man and i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life
p04681_B,04681,B,me brother what do you mean
p04682_B,04682,B,he likes you i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it what is the amount of his fortune
p04683_B,04683,B,i believe about two thousand a year
p04684_B,04684,B,two thousand a year elinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much for your sake
p04685_B,04685,B,indeed i believe you but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me
p04686_B,04686,B,you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken a very little trouble on your side secures him perhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back his friends may all advise him against it but some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him in spite of himself and there can be no reason why you should not try for him it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side in short you know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite out of the question the objections are insurmountable you have too much sense not to see all that colonel brandon must be the man and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family it is a match that must give universal satisfaction in short it is a kind of thing that will be exceedingly welcome to all parties that is i mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you and her mother too mrs ferrars a very good natured woman i am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other day it would be something remarkable now something droll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at the same time and yet it is not very unlikely
p04687_B,04687,B,is mr edward ferrars going to be married
p04688_B,04688,B,it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation he has a most excellent mother mrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year if the match takes place the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds a very desirable connection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place in time a thousand a year is a great deal for a mother to give away to make over for ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit to give you another instance of her liberality the other day as soon as we came to town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now she put bank notes into fanny s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great expense while we are here
p04689_B,04689,B,your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable but your income is a large one
p04690_B,04690,B,not so large i dare say as many people suppose i do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope will in time be better the enclosure of norland common now carrying on is a most serious drain and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live the land was so very desirable for me in every respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it my duty to buy it i could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands a man must pay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal of money
p04691_B,04691,B,more than you think it really and intrinsically worth
p04692_B,04692,B,why i hope not that i might have sold it again the next day for more than i gave but with regard to the purchase money i might have been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands i must have sold out to very great loss other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to norland our respected father as you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they were to your mother far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away you may guess after all these expenses how very far we must be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrars s kindness is
p04693_B,04693,B,certainly and assisted by her liberality i hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances
p04694_B,04694,B,another year or two may do much towards it but however there is still a great deal to be done there is not a stone laid of fanny s green house and nothing but the plan of the flower garden marked out
p04695_B,04695,B,where is the green house to be
p04696_B,04696,B,upon the knoll behind the house the old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it it will be a very fine object from many parts of the park and the flower garden will slope down just before it and be exceedingly pretty we have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow she seems a most valuable woman indeed her house her style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove materially advantageous her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten she must have a great deal to leave
p04697_B,04697,B,nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only her jointure which will descend to her children
p04698_B,04698,B,but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of
p04699_B,04699,B,and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters than to us
p04700_B,04700,B,her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you and treating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration which a conscientious woman would not disregard nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can hardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises
p04701_B,04701,B,but she raises none in those most concerned indeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far
p04702_B,04702,B,why to be sure people have little have very little in their power but my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne she looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown quite thin is she ill
p04703_B,04703,B,she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks
p04704_B,04704,B,i am sorry for that at her time of life any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever hers has been a very short one she was as handsome a girl last september as i ever saw and as likely to attract the man there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly i remember fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it happened to strike her she will be mistaken however i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a year at the utmost and i am very much deceived if you do not do better dorsetshire i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny lady middleton is really a most elegant woman such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know and mrs jennings too an exceedingly well behaved woman though not so elegant as her daughter your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally for we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way and fanny and mrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both
p04705_B,04705,B,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p04706_B,04706,B,beautifully indeed but she does every thing well
p04707_B,04707,B,this is admiration of a very particular kind what is miss morton to us who knows or who cares for her it is elinor of whom we think and speak
p04708_B,04708,B,miss morton is lord morton s daughter
p04709_B,04709,B,dear dear elinor don t mind them don t let them make you unhappy
p04710_B,04710,B,poor marianne she has not such good health as her sister she is very nervous she has not elinor s constitution and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions you would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably handsome a few months ago quite as handsome as elinor now you see it is all gone
p04711_B,04711,B,she was certainly very civil to you
p04712_B,04712,B,civil did you see nothing but only civility i saw a vast deal more such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me no pride no hauteur and your sister just the same all sweetness and affability
p04713_B,04713,B,undoubtedly if they had known your engagement nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you but as that was not the case
p04714_B,04714,B,i guessed you would say so but there was no reason in the world why mrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not and her liking me is every thing you shan t talk me out of my satisfaction i am sure it will all end well and there will be no difficulties at all to what i used to think mrs ferrars is a charming woman and so is your sister they are both delightful women indeed i wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable mrs dashwood was are you ill miss dashwood you seem low you don t speak sure you an t well
p04715_B,04715,B,i never was in better health
p04716_B,04716,B,i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it i should be sorry to have you ill you that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world heaven knows what i should have done without your friendship indeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next to edward s love it is the greatest comfort i have poor edward but now there is one good thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often for lady middleton s delighted with mrs dashwood so we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say and edward spends half his time with his sister besides lady middleton and mrs ferrars will visit now and mrs ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once they should always be glad to see me they are such charming women i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak too high i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me if she had only made me a formal courtesy for instance without saying a word and never after had took any notice of me and never looked at me in a pleasant way you know what i mean if i had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gave it all up in despair i could not have stood it for where she does dislike i know it is most violent
p04717_B,04717,B,do you like london
p04718_B,04718,B,not at all i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you are what you always were i think elinor we must employ edward to take care of us in our return to barton in a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday so dull so wretchedly dull but i have much to say to you on that head which cannot be said now but why were you not there edward why did you not come
p04719_B,04719,B,i was engaged elsewhere
p04720_B,04720,B,engaged but what was that when such friends were to be met
p04721_B,04721,B,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p04722_B,04722,B,not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation going so soon my dear edward this must not be
p04723_B,04723,B,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves
p04724_B,04724,B,you know elinor that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear if you only hope to have your assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it i cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not really wanted
p04725_B,04725,B,they had already spent a week in this manner in conduit street and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations
p04726_B,04726,B,my love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us they are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very well by edward we can ask your sisters some other year you know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them you know very much already and so does my mother and they are such favourites with harry
p04727_B,04727,B,no ma am what is it
p04728_B,04728,B,something so strange but you shall hear it all when i got to mr palmer s i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child she was sure it was very ill it cried and fretted and was all over pimples so i looked at it directly and says i and nurse said just the same but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so he stepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child he said just as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum and then charlotte was easy and so just as he was going away again it came into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news so upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to know something or other and at last he said in a whisper
p04729_B,04729,B,what is fanny ill
p04730_B,04730,B,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly
p04731_B,04731,B,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement
p04732_B,04732,B,four months have you known of this four months what while attending me in all my misery has this been on your heart and i have reproached you for being happy
p04733_B,04733,B,it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse
p04734_B,04734,B,four months so calm so cheerful how have you been supported
p04735_B,04735,B,by feeling that i was doing my duty my promise to lucy obliged me to be secret i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy i have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother and once or twice i have attempted it but without betraying my trust i never could have convinced you
p04736_B,04736,B,four months and yet you loved him
p04737_B,04737,B,yes but i did not love only him and while the comfort of others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing how much i felt now i can think and speak of it with little emotion i would not have you suffer on my account for i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself i have many things to support me i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther i acquit edward of essential misconduct i wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always doing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret in the end he must become so lucy does not want sense and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built and after all marianne after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so edward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her
p04738_B,04738,B,if such is your way of thinking if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your resolution your self command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at they are brought more within my comprehension
p04739_B,04739,B,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy
p04740_B,04740,B,oh elinor you have made me hate myself for ever how barbarous have i been to you you who have been my only comfort who have borne with me in all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering for me is this my gratitude is this the only return i can make you because your merit cries out upon myself i have been trying to do it away
p04741_B,04741,B,gracious god can this be possible
p04742_B,04742,B,well may you wonder marianne at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these your exclamation is very natural all this however was urged in vain edward said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement he would stand to it cost him what it might
p04743_B,04743,B,then he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband
p04744_B,04744,B,i would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours madam miss lucy steele is i dare say a very deserving young woman but in the present case you know the connection must be impossible and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short i do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for mrs jennings we all wish her extremely happy and mrs ferrars s conduct throughout the whole has been such as every conscientious good mother in like circumstances would adopt it has been dignified and liberal edward has drawn his own lot and i fear it will be a bad one
p04745_B,04745,B,well sir and how did it end
p04746_B,04746,B,i am sorry to say ma am in a most unhappy rupture edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice he left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether he is still in town i do not know for we of course can make no inquiry
p04747_B,04747,B,poor young man and what is to become of him
p04748_B,04748,B,what indeed ma am it is a melancholy consideration born to the prospect of such affluence i cannot conceive a situation more deplorable the interest of two thousand pounds how can a man live on it and when to that is added the recollection that he might but for his own folly within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand five hundred a year for miss morton has thirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition we must all feel for him and the more so because it is totally out of our power to assist him
p04749_B,04749,B,poor young man i am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house and so i would tell him if i could see him it is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now at lodgings and taverns
p04750_B,04750,B,if he would only have done as well by himself as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing but as it is it must be out of anybody s power to assist him and there is one thing more preparing against him which must be worse than all his mother has determined with a very natural kind of spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately which might have been edward s on proper conditions i left her this morning with her lawyer talking over the business
p04751_B,04751,B,well that is her revenge everybody has a way of their own but i don t think mine would be to make one son independent because another had plagued me
p04752_B,04752,B,can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own poor edward i feel for him sincerely
p04753_B,04753,B,get it all out of her my dear she will tell you any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke
p04754_B,04754,B,not at all i believe with you
p04755_B,04755,B,that is a good thing and lady middleton is she angry
p04756_B,04756,B,i cannot suppose it possible that she should be
p04757_B,04757,B,i am monstrous glad of it good gracious i have had such a time of it i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life she vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again so long as she lived but now she is quite come to and we are as good friends as ever look she made me this bow to my hat and put in the feather last night there now you are going to laugh at me too but why should not i wear pink ribbons i do not care if it is the doctor s favourite colour i am sure for my part i should never have known he did like it better than any other colour if he had not happened to say so my cousins have been so plaguing me i declare sometimes i do not know which way to look before them well but miss dashwood people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars s declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill natured reports to be spread abroad whatever lucy might think about it herself you know it was no business of other people to set it down for certain
p04758_B,04758,B,i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure you
p04759_B,04759,B,oh did not you but it was said i know very well and by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him once lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits rose against that however this morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came out how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and been talked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house he had got upon his horse and rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the better of it and after thinking it all over and over again he said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it must be for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to live upon that he could not bear to think of her doing no better and so he begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to the matter directly and leave him shift for himself i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be and it was entirely for her sake and upon her account that he said a word about being off and not upon his own i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it but to be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you know and all that oh la one can t repeat such kind of things you know she told him directly she had not the least mind in the world to be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little so ever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you know or something of the kind so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in her coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons
p04760_B,04760,B,i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them you were all in the same room together were not you
p04761_B,04761,B,no indeed not us la miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by oh for shame to be sure you must know better than that no no they were shut up in the drawing room together and all i heard was only by listening at the door
p04762_B,04762,B,how have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door i am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself how could you behave so unfairly by your sister
p04763_B,04763,B,oh la there is nothing in that i only stood at the door and heard what i could and i am sure lucy would have done just the same by me for a year or two back when martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together she never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind a chimney board on purpose to hear what we said edward talks of going to oxford soon but now he is lodging at no pall mall what an ill natured woman his mother is an t she and your brother and sister were not very kind however i shan t say anything against them to you and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot which was more than i looked for and for my part i was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however nothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine out of sight edward have got some business at oxford he says so he must go there for a time and after that as soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious i d lay my life i know what my cousins will say when they hear of it they will tell me i should write to the doctor to get edward the curacy of his new living i know they will but i am sure i would not do such a thing for all the world la i shall say directly i wonder how you could think of such a thing i write to the doctor indeed
p04764_B,04764,B,well it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst you have got your answer ready
p04765_B,04765,B,oh la here come the richardsons i had a vast deal more to say to you but i must not stay away from them not any longer i assure you they are very genteel people he makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their own coach i have not time to speak to mrs jennings about it myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us and lady middleton the same and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away and mrs jennings should want company i am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes i suppose lady middleton won t ask us any more this bout good by i am sorry miss marianne was not here remember me kindly to her la if you have not got your spotted muslin on i wonder you was not afraid of its being torn
p04766_B,04766,B,you forget that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of
p04767_B,04767,B,but it is in somersetshire i cannot go into somersetshire there where i looked forward to going no elinor you cannot expect me to go there
p04768_B,04768,B,i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p04769_B,04769,B,i have heard of the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered from his family for if i understand the matter right he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman have i been rightly informed is it so the cruelty the impolitic cruelty of dividing or attempting to divide two young people long attached to each other is terrible mrs ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to i have seen mr ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with him he is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time but i have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake and as a friend of yours i wish it still more i understand that he intends to take orders will you be so good as to tell him that the living of delaford now just vacant as i am informed by this day s post is his if he think it worth his acceptance but that perhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now it may be nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it were more valuable it is a rectory but a small one the late incumbent i believe did not make more than 200 per annum and though it is certainly capable of improvement i fear not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income such as it is however my pleasure in presenting it to him will be very great pray assure him of it
p04770_B,04770,B,the smallness of the house i cannot imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income
p04771_B,04771,B,this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p04772_B,04772,B,thank you ma am it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life
p04773_B,04773,B,lord my dear you are very modest i an t the least astonished at it in the world for i have often thought of late there was nothing more likely to happen
p04774_B,04774,B,you judged from your knowledge of the colonel s general benevolence but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur
p04775_B,04775,B,opportunity oh as to that when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity well my dear i wish you joy of it again and again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think i shall soon know where to look for them
p04776_B,04776,B,you mean to go to delaford after them i suppose
p04777_B,04777,B,aye my dear that i do indeed and as to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever i saw
p04778_B,04778,B,he spoke of its being out of repair
p04779_B,04779,B,well and whose fault is that why don t he repair it who should do it but himself well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be quite alone i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company and besides you must long to tell your sister all about it
p04780_B,04780,B,certainly ma am i shall tell marianne of it but i shall not mention it at present to any body else
p04781_B,04781,B,oh very well then you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think of going as far as holborn to day
p04782_B,04782,B,no ma am not even lucy if you please one day s delay will not be very material and till i have written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else i shall do that directly it is of importance that no time should be lost with him for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination
p04783_B,04783,B,oh ho i understand you mr ferrars is to be the man well so much the better for him ay to be sure he must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad to find things are so forward between you but my dear is not this rather out of character should not the colonel write himself sure he is the proper person
p04784_B,04784,B,colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars than himself
p04785_B,04785,B,and so you are forced to do it well that is an odd kind of delicacy however i will not disturb you you know your own concerns best so goodby my dear i have not heard of any thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed i have just been thinking of betty s sister my dear i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress but whether she would do for a lady s maid i am sure i can t tell she is an excellent housemaid and works very well at her needle however you will think of all that at your leisure
p04786_B,04786,B,certainly ma am
p04787_B,04787,B,you would not have gone however without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person mrs jennings was quite right in what she said i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was on the point of communicating by paper i am charged with a most agreeable office colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasure in offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well judging a friend and to join in his wish that the living it is about two hundred a year were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such in short as might establish all your views of happiness
p04788_B,04788,B,colonel brandon
p04789_B,04789,B,yes colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which i am sure marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion
p04790_B,04790,B,colonel brandon give me a living can it be possible
p04791_B,04791,B,the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where
p04792_B,04792,B,no not to find it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all i feel it i would express it if i could but as you well know i am no orator
p04793_B,04793,B,you are very much mistaken i do assure you that you owe it entirely at least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandon s discernment of it i have had no hand in it i did not even know till i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift as a friend of mine of my family he may perhaps indeed i know he has still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owe nothing to my solicitation
p04794_B,04794,B,colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability i have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems him highly he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectly the gentleman
p04795_B,04795,B,indeed i believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house it is particularly important that he should be all this
p04796_B,04796,B,colonel brandon i think lodges in st james street i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man
p04797_B,04797,B,when i see him again i shall see him the husband of lucy
p04798_B,04798,B,no ma am that was not very likely
p04799_B,04799,B,well and how soon will he be ready for it seems all to depend upon that
p04800_B,04800,B,really i know so little of these kind of forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three months will complete his ordination
p04801_B,04801,B,two or three months lord my dear how calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out of patience and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him sure somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is in orders already
p04802_B,04802,B,my dear ma am what can you be thinking of why colonel brandon s only object is to be of use to mr ferrars
p04803_B,04803,B,lord bless you my dear sure you do not mean to persuade me that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr ferrars aye aye the parsonage is but a small one and very likely may be out of repair but to hear a man apologising as i thought for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground floor and i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds and to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage it seems quite ridiculous but my dear we must touch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it
p04804_B,04804,B,but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living s being enough to allow them to marry
p04805_B,04805,B,the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shan t go if lucy an t there
p04806_B,04806,B,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward
p04807_B,04807,B,really well this is very astonishing no relationship no connection between them and now that livings fetch such a price what was the value of this
p04808_B,04808,B,about two hundred a year
p04809_B,04809,B,very well and for the next presentation to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly and likely to vacate it soon he might have got i dare say fourteen hundred pounds and how came he not to have settled that matter before this person s death now indeed it would be too late to sell it but a man of colonel brandon s sense i wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common such natural concern well i am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough to take it aye aye that is the fact depend upon it it is truly astonishing what could be the colonel s motive
p04810_B,04810,B,a very simple one to be of use to mr ferrars
p04811_B,04811,B,well well whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very lucky man you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though i have broke it to her and she bears it vastly well she will not like to hear it much talked of mrs ferrars knows nothing about it at present and i believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all
p04812_B,04812,B,but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise surely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him she would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent
p04813_B,04813,B,ah elinor your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature when edward s unhappy match takes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him and therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son
p04814_B,04814,B,you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time
p04815_B,04815,B,you wrong her exceedingly mrs ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world we think now of robert s marrying miss morton
p04816_B,04816,B,the lady i suppose has no choice in the affair
p04817_B,04817,B,choice how do you mean
p04818_B,04818,B,i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert
p04819_B,04819,B,certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other of one thing my dear sister i may assure you and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it but i have it from the very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her daughter did and i have it from her that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection you understand me it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all she said and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately
p04820_B,04820,B,have you ever seen the lady
p04821_B,04821,B,yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved
p04822_B,04822,B,not yet but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton
p04823_B,04823,B,but she must not go round by london i shall never see her if she goes by london
p04824_B,04824,B,no sir i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house
p04825_B,04825,B,had they told me that mr palmer and all his relations were at the devil it would not have turned me from the door my business is with you and only you
p04826_B,04826,B,with me well sir be quick and if you can less violent
p04827_B,04827,B,sit down and i will be both
p04828_B,04828,B,pray be quick sir i have no time to spare
p04829_B,04829,B,your sister is out of danger i heard it from the servant god be praised but is it true is it really true for god s sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not
p04830_B,04830,B,we hope she is
p04831_B,04831,B,had i known as much half an hour ago but since i am here what does it signify for once miss dashwood it will be the last time perhaps let us be cheerful together i am in a fine mood for gaiety tell me honestly do you think me most a knave or a fool
p04832_B,04832,B,mr willoughby i advise you at present to return to combe i am not at leisure to remain with you longer whatever your business may be with me it will be better recollected and explained to morrow
p04833_B,04833,B,i understand you yes i am very drunk a pint of porter with my cold beef at marlborough was enough to over set me
p04834_B,04834,B,at marlborough
p04835_B,04835,B,yes i left london this morning at eight o clock and the only ten minutes i have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at marlborough
p04836_B,04836,B,mr willoughby you ought to feel and i certainly do that after what has passed your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse what is it that you mean by it
p04837_B,04837,B,i mean if i can to make you hate me one degree less than you do now i mean to offer some kind of explanation some kind of apology for the past to open my whole heart to you and by convincing you that though i have been always a blockhead i have not been always a rascal to obtain something like forgiveness from ma from your sister
p04838_B,04838,B,is this the real reason of your coming
p04839_B,04839,B,upon my soul it is
p04840_B,04840,B,if that is all you may be satisfied already for marianne does she has long forgiven you
p04841_B,04841,B,has she then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds now will you listen to me i do not know how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me perhaps you will hardly think the better of me it is worth the trial however and you shall hear every thing when i first became intimate in your family i had no other intention no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain in devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before your sister s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me and her behaviour to me almost from the first was of a kind it is astonishing when i reflect on what it was and what she was that my heart should have been so insensible but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it careless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement giving way to feelings which i had always been too much in the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means in my power to make myself pleasing to her without any design of returning her affection
p04842_B,04842,B,it is hardly worth while mr willoughby for you to relate or for me to listen any longer such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject
p04843_B,04843,B,i insist on you hearing the whole of it my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself every year since my coming of age or even before i believe had added to my debts and though the death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free yet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant it had been for some time my intention to re establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune to attach myself to your sister therefore was not a thing to be thought of and with a meanness selfishness cruelty which no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours miss dashwood can ever reprobate too much i was acting in this manner trying to engage her regard without a thought of returning it but one thing may be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity i did not know the extent of the injury i meditated because i did not then know what it was to love but have i ever known it well may it be doubted for had i really loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity to avarice or what is more could i have sacrificed hers but i have done it to avoid a comparative poverty which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence lost every thing that could make it a blessing
p04844_B,04844,B,you did then believe yourself at one time attached to her
p04845_B,04845,B,to have resisted such attractions to have withstood such tenderness is there a man on earth who could have done it yes i found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life were what i spent with her when i felt my intentions were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless even then however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed i will not reason here nor will i stop for you to expatiate on the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound the event has proved that i was a cunning fool providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever at last however my resolution was taken and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display but in the interim in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass before i could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance to ruin all my resolution and with it all my comfort a discovery took place mrs smith had somehow or other been informed i imagine by some distant relation whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour of an affair a connection but i need not explain myself farther your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago
p04846_B,04846,B,i have i have heard it all and how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension
p04847_B,04847,B,remember from whom you received the account could it be an impartial one i acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me i do not mean to justify myself but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because i was a libertine she must be a saint if the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding i do not mean however to defend myself her affection for me deserved better treatment and i often with great self reproach recall the tenderness which for a very short time had the power of creating any return i wish i heartily wish it had never been but i have injured more than herself and i have injured one whose affection for me may i say it was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind oh how infinitely superior
p04848_B,04848,B,your indifference however towards that unfortunate girl i must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her do not think yourself excused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding on her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours you must have known that while you were enjoying yourself in devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay always happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence
p04849_B,04849,B,but upon my soul i did not know it i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction and common sense might have told her how to find it out
p04850_B,04850,B,well sir and what said mrs smith
p04851_B,04851,B,she taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion may be guessed the purity of her life the formality of her notions her ignorance of the world every thing was against me the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it she was previously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my conduct in general and was moreover discontented with the very little attention the very little portion of my time that i had bestowed on her in my present visit in short it ended in a total breach by one measure i might have saved myself in the height of her morality good woman she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza that could not be and i was formally dismissed from her favour and her house the night following this affair i was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be the struggle was great but it ended too soon my affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally inclined to feel and expensive society had increased i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do a heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave devonshire i was engaged to dine with you on that very day some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement but whether i should write this apology or deliver it in person was a point of long debate to see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted whether i could see her again and keep to my resolution in that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity as the event declared for i went i saw her and saw her miserable and left her miserable and left her hoping never to see her again
p04852_B,04852,B,why did you call mr willoughby a note would have answered every purpose why was it necessary to call
p04853_B,04853,B,it was necessary to my own pride i could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you or the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part of what had really passed between mrs smith and myself and i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage in my way to honiton the sight of your dear sister however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone you were all gone i do not know where i had left her only the evening before so fully so firmly resolved within my self on doing right a few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i walked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself delighted with every body but in this our last interview of friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted rascal i was
p04854_B,04854,B,did you tell her that you should soon return
p04855_B,04855,B,i do not know what i told her less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future i cannot think of it it won t do then came your dear mother to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence thank heaven it did torture me i was miserable miss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now well i went left all that i loved and went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent my journey to town travelling with my own horses and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when i looked forward every thing so inviting when i looked back at barton the picture so soothing oh it was a blessed journey
p04856_B,04856,B,well sir and this is all
p04857_B,04857,B,all no have you forgot what passed in town that infamous letter did she show it you
p04858_B,04858,B,yes i saw every note that passed
p04859_B,04859,B,when the first of hers reached me as it immediately did for i was in town the whole time what i felt is in the common phrase not to be expressed in a more simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion my feelings were very very painful every line every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart to know that marianne was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt thunderbolts and daggers what a reproof would she have given me her taste her opinions i believe they are better known to me than my own and i am sure they are dearer
p04860_B,04860,B,this is not right mr willoughby remember that you are married relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear
p04861_B,04861,B,marianne s note by assuring me that i was still as dear to her as in former days that in spite of the many many weeks we had been separated she was as constant in her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever awakened all my remorse i say awakened because time and london business and dissipation had in some measure quieted it and i had been growing a fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so and silencing every reproach overcoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then i shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married but this note made me know myself better i felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world and that i was using her infamously but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me to retreat was impossible all that i had to do was to avoid you both i sent no answer to marianne intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street but at last judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the house one morning and left my name
p04862_B,04862,B,watched us out of the house
p04863_B,04863,B,even so you would be surprised to hear how often i watched you how often i was on the point of falling in with you i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight as the carriage drove by lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long i avoided the middletons as much as possible as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common not aware of their being in town however i blundered on sir john i believe the first day of his coming and the day after i had called at mrs jennings s he asked me to a party a dance at his house in the evening had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there i should have felt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him the next morning brought another short note from marianne still affectionate open artless confiding everything that could make my conduct most hateful i could not answer it i tried but could not frame a sentence but i thought of her i believe every moment of the day if you can pity me miss dashwood pity my situation as it was then with my head and heart full of your sister i was forced to play the happy lover to another woman those three or four weeks were worse than all well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone oh god holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was well it does not signify it is over now such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white as death that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me it was a horrid sight yet when i thought of her to day as really dying it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that i knew exactly how she would appear to those who saw her last in this world she was before me constantly before me as i travelled in the same look and hue well let me make haste and be gone your sister is certainly better certainly out of danger
p04864_B,04864,B,we are assured of it
p04865_B,04865,B,your poor mother too doting on marianne
p04866_B,04866,B,but the letter mr willoughby your own letter have you any thing to say about that
p04867_B,04867,B,yes yes that in particular your sister wrote to me again you know the very next morning you saw what she said i was breakfasting at the ellisons and her letter with some others was brought to me there from my lodgings it happened to catch sophia s eye before it caught mine and its size the elegance of the paper the hand writing altogether immediately gave her a suspicion some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever affecting that air of playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman one loves she opened the letter directly and read its contents she was well paid for her impudence she read what made her wretched her wretchedness i could have borne but her passion her malice at all events it must be appeased and in short what do you think of my wife s style of letter writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not
p04868_B,04868,B,your wife the letter was in your own hand writing
p04869_B,04869,B,yes but i had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as i was ashamed to put my name to the original was all her own her own happy thoughts and gentle diction but what could i do we were engaged every thing in preparation the day almost fixed but i am talking like a fool preparation day in honest words her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture and after all what did it signify to my character in the opinion of marianne and her friends in what language my answer was couched it must have been only to one end my business was to declare myself a scoundrel and whether i did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance said i to myself such were my reasonings as in a sort of desperate carelessness i copied my wife s words and parted with the last relics of marianne her three notes unluckily they were all in my pocketbook or i should have denied their existence and hoarded them for ever i was forced to put them up and could not even kiss them and the lock of hair that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me
p04870_B,04870,B,you are very wrong mr willoughby very blamable you ought not to speak in this way either of mrs willoughby or my sister you had made your own choice it was not forced on you your wife has a claim to your politeness to your respect at least she must be attached to you or she would not have married you to treat her with unkindness to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to marianne nor can i suppose it a relief to your own conscience
p04871_B,04871,B,do not talk to me of my wife she does not deserve your compassion she knew i had no regard for her when we married well married we were and came down to combe magna to be happy and afterwards returned to town to be gay and now do you pity me miss dashwood or have i said all this to no purpose am i be it only one degree am i less guilty in your opinion than i was before my intentions were not always wrong have i explained away any part of my guilt
p04872_B,04872,B,yes you have certainly removed something a little you have proved yourself on the whole less faulty than i had believed you you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked but i hardly know the misery that you have inflicted i hardly know what could have made it worse
p04873_B,04873,B,will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered what i have been telling you let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours you tell me that she has forgiven me already let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart and of my present feelings will draw from her a more spontaneous more natural more gentle less dignified forgiveness tell her of my misery and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her and if you will that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever
p04874_B,04874,B,i will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called your justification but you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now nor how you heard of her illness
p04875_B,04875,B,last night in drury lane lobby i ran against sir john middleton and when he saw who i was for the first time these two months he spoke to me that he had cut me ever since my marriage i had seen without surprise or resentment now however his good natured honest stupid soul full of indignation against me and concern for your sister could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to though probably he did not think it would vex me horridly as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland a letter that morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger most imminent the palmers are all gone off in a fright c i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john his heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much of his ill will was done away that when we parted he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy what i felt on hearing that your sister was dying and dying too believing me the greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me in her latest moments for how could i tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed one person i was sure would represent me as capable of anything what i felt was dreadful my resolution was soon made and at eight o clock this morning i was in my carriage now you know all there is no use in staying here i must be off
p04876_B,04876,B,are you going back to town
p04877_B,04877,B,no to combe magna i have business there from thence to town in a day or two good bye and you do think something better of me than you did as to that i must rub through the world as well as i can domestic happiness is out of the question if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something to live for marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again well once more good bye i shall now go away and live in dread of one event
p04878_B,04878,B,what do you mean
p04879_B,04879,B,your sister s marriage
p04880_B,04880,B,you are very wrong she can never be more lost to you than she is now
p04881_B,04881,B,but she will be gained by some one else and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye god bless you
p04882_B,04882,B,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established
p04883_B,04883,B,i know it is or after such a warning i should be the last to encourage such affection or even to be pleased by it but his coming for me as he did with such active such ready friendship is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men
p04884_B,04884,B,his character however does not rest on one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne were humanity out of the case would have prompted him to mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him and even my own knowledge of him though lately acquired is very considerable and so highly do i value and esteem him that if marianne can be happy with him i shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope
p04885_B,04885,B,oh my love i could not then talk of hope to him or to myself marianne might at that moment be dying but he did not ask for hope or encouragement his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend not an application to a parent yet after a time i did say for at first i was quite overcome that if she lived as i trusted she might my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage and since our arrival since our delightful security i have repeated it to him more fully have given him every encouragement in my power time a very little time i tell him will do everything marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as willoughby his own merits must soon secure it
p04886_B,04886,B,to judge from the colonel s spirits however you have not yet made him equally sanguine
p04887_B,04887,B,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one
p04888_B,04888,B,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy
p04889_B,04889,B,yes my peace of mind is doubly involved in it for not only is it horrible to suspect a person who has been what he has been to me of such designs but what must it make me appear to myself what in a situation like mine but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to
p04890_B,04890,B,how then would you account for his behaviour
p04891_B,04891,B,i would suppose him oh how gladly would i suppose him only fickle very very fickle i am not wishing him too much good when i wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own he will suffer enough in them
p04892_B,04892,B,do you compare your conduct with his
p04893_B,04893,B,no i compare it with what it ought to have been i compare it with yours
p04894_B,04894,B,our situations have borne little resemblance
p04895_B,04895,B,they have borne more than our conduct do not my dearest elinor let your kindness defend what i know your judgment must censure my illness has made me think it has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection long before i was enough recovered to talk i was perfectly able to reflect i considered the past i saw in my own behaviour since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself and want of kindness to others i saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave my illness i well knew had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health as i had felt even at the time to be wrong had i died it would have been self destruction i did not know my danger till the danger was removed but with such feelings as these reflections gave me i wonder at my recovery wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live to have time for atonement to my god and to you all did not kill me at once had i died in what peculiar misery should i have left you my nurse my friend my sister you who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days who had known all the murmurings of my heart how should i have lived in your remembrance my mother too how could you have consoled her i cannot express my own abhorrence of myself whenever i looked towards the past i saw some duty neglected or some failing indulged every body seemed injured by me the kindness the unceasing kindness of mrs jennings i had repaid with ungrateful contempt to the middletons to the palmers the steeles to every common acquaintance even i had been insolent and unjust with a heart hardened against their merits and a temper irritated by their very attention to john to fanny yes even to them little as they deserve i had given less than their due but you you above all above my mother had been wronged by me i and only i knew your heart and its sorrows yet to what did it influence me not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself your example was before me but to what avail was i more considerate of you and your comfort did i imitate your forbearance or lessen your restraints by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone no not less when i knew you to be unhappy than when i had believed you at ease did i turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me and leaving you for whom i professed an unbounded affection to be miserable for my sake you are very good the future must be my proof i have laid down my plan and if i am capable of adhering to it my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself i shall now live solely for my family you my mother and margaret must henceforth be all the world to me you will share my affections entirely between you from you from my home i shall never again have the smallest incitement to move and if i do mix in other society it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled my heart amended and that i can practise the civilities the lesser duties of life with gentleness and forbearance as for willoughby to say that i shall soon or that i shall ever forget him would be idle his remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions but it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment if i could but know his heart everything would become easy tell mama
p04896_B,04896,B,i know it i know it happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt
p04897_B,04897,B,i wish for no change
p04898_B,04898,B,you consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties
p04899_B,04899,B,it is very true my happiness never was his object
p04900_B,04900,B,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife
p04901_B,04901,B,i have not a doubt of it and i have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly
p04902_B,04902,B,rather say your mother s imprudence my child she must be answerable
p04903_B,04903,B,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
p04904_B,04904,B,who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas

p04921_B,04921,B,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p04922_B,04922,B,he comes from mr pratt s purposely to see us i will be calm i will be mistress of myself
p04923_B,04923,B,at longstaple no my mother is in town
p04924_B,04924,B,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars
p04925_B,04925,B,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish
p04926_B,04926,B,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her
p04927_B,04927,B,she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite she will be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner i thought it my duty independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me in such a situation as that where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement and even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantage it could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living
p04928_B,04928,B,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be
p04929_B,04929,B,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering
p04930_B,04930,B,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first
p04931_B,04931,B,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit
