p00000_A,00000,A,i must take leave to observe sir walter that the present juncture is much in our favour this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore they will be all wanting a home could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants many a noble fortune has been made during the war if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter
p00001_A,00001,A,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p00002_A,00002,A,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p00003_A,00003,A,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd
p00004_A,00004,A,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p00005_A,00005,A,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p00006_A,00006,A,there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description
p00007_A,00007,A,yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man i have observed it all my life a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixty two forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age
p00008_A,00008,A,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00009_A,00009,A,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p00010_A,00010,A,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p00011_A,00011,A,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p00012_A,00012,A,bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed
p00013_A,00013,A,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p00014_A,00014,A,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00015_A,00015,A,oh certainly
p00016_A,00016,A,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00017_A,00017,A,oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas
p00018_A,00018,A,no nothing
p00019_A,00019,A,no nothing at all
p00020_A,00020,A,she sees nothing to blame in it on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith
p00021_A,00021,A,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00022_A,00022,A,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00023_A,00023,A,and who is admiral croft
p00024_A,00024,A,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p00025_A,00025,A,how is mary looking the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day
p00026_A,00026,A,merely gowland
p00027_A,00027,A,westgate buildings and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty
p00028_A,00028,A,no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch
p00029_A,00029,A,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p00030_A,00030,A,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00031_A,00031,A,i cannot possibly do without anne
p00032_A,00032,A,mrs clay never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles
p00033_A,00033,A,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00034_A,00034,A,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p00035_A,00035,A,have they any acquaintance here
p00036_A,00036,A,there is hardly any personal defect which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to
p00037_A,00037,A,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p00038_A,00038,A,so you are come at last i began to think i should never see you i am so ill i can hardly speak i have not seen a creature the whole morning
p00039_A,00039,A,yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning
p00040_A,00040,A,yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad
p00041_A,00041,A,i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way
p00042_A,00042,A,i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday
p00043_A,00043,A,dear me what can you possibly have to do
p00044_A,00044,A,oh well but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday
p00045_A,00045,A,oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone
p00046_A,00046,A,nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it where shall we go i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you
p00047_A,00047,A,so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday
p00048_A,00048,A,i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing
p00049_A,00049,A,yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day
p00050_A,00050,A,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p00051_A,00051,A,you have had your little boys with you
p00052_A,00052,A,well you will soon be better now you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house
p00053_A,00053,A,you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early
p00054_A,00054,A,my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner
p00055_A,00055,A,a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time
p00056_A,00056,A,did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party
p00057_A,00057,A,i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party
p00058_A,00058,A,i have not the smallest objection on that account i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves
p00059_A,00059,A,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p00060_A,00060,A,but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy
p00061_A,00061,A,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p00062_A,00062,A,it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country perhaps you may not have heard that he is married
p00063_A,00063,A,but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days
p00064_A,00064,A,the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour
p00065_A,00065,A,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p00066_A,00066,A,now you are talking nonsense mary it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied
p00067_A,00067,A,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p00068_A,00068,A,i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday
p00069_A,00069,A,upon my word it would dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations you know i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross
p00070_A,00070,A,you will not find her there quite worn out and broken up i was the last man who commanded her hardly fit for service then reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies the admiralty entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed
p00071_A,00071,A,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p00072_A,00072,A,phoo phoo what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his
p00073_A,00073,A,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00074_A,00074,A,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p00075_A,00075,A,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00076_A,00076,A,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p00077_A,00077,A,and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance
p00078_A,00078,A,she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it
p00079_A,00079,A,mary is good natured enough in many respects but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne
p00080_A,00080,A,oh yes certainly
p00081_A,00081,A,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00082_A,00082,A,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00083_A,00083,A,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p00084_A,00084,A,we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials
p00085_A,00085,A,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p00086_A,00086,A,to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say
p00087_A,00087,A,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00088_A,00088,A,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p00089_A,00089,A,oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend
p00090_A,00090,A,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p00091_A,00091,A,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p00092_A,00092,A,nothing to the purpose you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board
p00093_A,00093,A,all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself
p00094_A,00094,A,i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board
p00095_A,00095,A,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p00096_A,00096,A,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p00097_A,00097,A,but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then
p00098_A,00098,A,depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable
p00099_A,00099,A,my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings
p00100_A,00100,A,ay that we shall
p00101_A,00101,A,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00102_A,00102,A,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p00103_A,00103,A,i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here
p00104_A,00104,A,i hope the little boy is better
p00105_A,00105,A,had you i honour you
p00106_A,00106,A,is there no one to help me
p00107_A,00107,A,oh god her father and mother
p00108_A,00108,A,true true a surgeon this instant
p00109_A,00109,A,but it rains
p00110_A,00110,A,though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair
p00111_A,00111,A,i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time it was a frightful hour a frightful day the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery
p00112_A,00112,A,yes but there i think ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not
p00113_A,00113,A,about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire
p00114_A,00114,A,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p00115_A,00115,A,you have not been long enough in bath to enjoy the evening parties of the place
p00116_A,00116,A,you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes
p00117_A,00117,A,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me
p00118_A,00118,A,perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added
p00119_A,00119,A,no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here
p00120_A,00120,A,not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then
p00121_A,00121,A,they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say
p00122_A,00122,A,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p00123_A,00123,A,a surgeon
p00124_A,00124,A,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p00125_A,00125,A,i am much obliged to you but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking
p00126_A,00126,A,oh very little nothing that i regard
p00127_A,00127,A,how do you do
p00128_A,00128,A,certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both sides good principles and good temper
p00129_A,00129,A,you were a good while at lyme i think
p00130_A,00130,A,i should very much like to see lyme again
p00131_A,00131,A,oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player
p00132_A,00132,A,i am not yet so much changed
p00133_A,00133,A,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
p00134_A,00134,A,i should have thought that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this
p00135_A,00135,A,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion
p00136_A,00136,A,would i
p00137_A,00137,A,walter get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you
p00138_A,00138,A,what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills they talked of coming into this side of the country i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day oh it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not
p00139_A,00139,A,she would have turned back then but for you
p00140_A,00140,A,happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind
p00141_A,00141,A,do you mean that she refused him
p00142_A,00142,A,when did that happen
p00143_A,00143,A,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p00144_A,00144,A,no no
p00145_A,00145,A,miss elliot i am sure you are tired do let us have the pleasure of taking you home here is excellent room for three i assure you if we were all like you i believe we might sit four you must indeed you must
p00146_A,00146,A,we had better not talk about it my dear for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before
p00147_A,00147,A,he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth
p00148_A,00148,A,well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other
p00149_A,00149,A,pray can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away
p00150_A,00150,A,yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london
p00151_A,00151,A,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p00152_A,00152,A,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p00153_A,00153,A,there you see just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery
p00154_A,00154,A,she is dead she is dead
p00155_A,00155,A,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p00156_A,00156,A,miss elliot you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much i wish he could have such company oftener it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do we cannot part
p00157_A,00157,A,ay true enough only june
p00158_A,00158,A,look here do you know who that is
p00159_A,00159,A,yes and you may guess who it is for but it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it he is writing about it now poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon
p00160_A,00160,A,it was not in her nature she doted on him
p00161_A,00161,A,granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since
p00162_A,00162,A,no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather
p00163_A,00163,A,there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men
p00164_A,00164,A,but how shall we prove anything
p00165_A,00165,A,ah if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts
p00166_A,00166,A,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p00167_A,00167,A,and not known to him perhaps so soon
p00168_A,00168,A,certainly captain benwick
p00169_A,00169,A,no that i can easily believe
p00170_A,00170,A,it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions
p00171_A,00171,A,true very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick
p00172_A,00172,A,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p00173_A,00173,A,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p00174_A,00174,A,we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said
p00175_A,00175,A,oh i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone
p00176_A,00176,A,captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found
p00177_A,00177,A,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00178_A,00178,A,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p00179_A,00179,A,such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now
p00180_A,00180,A,that cannot be much to your taste i know but i do believe him to be an excellent young man
p00181_A,00181,A,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00182_A,00182,A,and a very good living it was only five and twenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation not that he will value it as he ought charles is too cool about sporting that s the worst of him
p00183_A,00183,A,oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now
p00184_A,00184,A,yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long
p00185_A,00185,A,i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house it will be some trial to us both
p00186_A,00186,A,i hope i shall remember in future not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays
p00187_A,00187,A,it was an acquaintance worth having
p00188_A,00188,A,i am no match maker as you well know being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one
p00189_A,00189,A,ay a very bad business indeed a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress s head is not it miss elliot this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly now this must be very bad for you to be coming and finding us here i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad but now do not stand upon ceremony get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it
p00190_A,00190,A,ha is it you thank you thank you this is treating me like a friend here i am you see staring at a picture i can never get by this shop without stopping but what a thing here is by way of a boat do look at it did you ever see the like what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be i wonder where that boat was built i would not venture over a horsepond in it well now where are you bound can i go anywhere for you or with you can i be of any use
p00191_A,00191,A,that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm that s right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is
p00192_A,00192,A,yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick
p00193_A,00193,A,well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for
p00194_A,00194,A,oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice
p00195_A,00195,A,well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross
p00196_A,00196,A,not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him
p00197_A,00197,A,yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think poor frederick now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath
p00198_A,00198,A,another time sir i thank you not now
p00199_A,00199,A,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p00200_A,00200,A,did you say that you had something to tell me sir
p00201_A,00201,A,a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick
p00202_A,00202,A,i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man and i understand that he bears an excellent character
p00203_A,00203,A,indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please
p00204_A,00204,A,i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man
p00205_A,00205,A,certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort
p00206_A,00206,A,oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man i do not know what he would be at we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heart broken man as captain benwick
p00207_A,00207,A,i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you at all
p00208_A,00208,A,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p00209_A,00209,A,oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go
p00210_A,00210,A,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p00211_A,00211,A,now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is oh he talks of you in such terms
p00212_A,00212,A,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p00213_A,00213,A,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00214_A,00214,A,well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother
p00215_A,00215,A,phoo phoo what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play
p00216_A,00216,A,no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise
p00217_A,00217,A,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p00218_A,00218,A,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p00219_A,00219,A,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p00220_A,00220,A,you will not like him i will answer for it
p00221_A,00221,A,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p00222_A,00222,A,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00223_A,00223,A,any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me
p00224_A,00224,A,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p00225_A,00225,A,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p00226_A,00226,A,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p00227_A,00227,A,anne there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now they seemed deep in talk who is it come and tell me good heavens i recollect it is mr elliot himself
p00228_A,00228,A,do come anne come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme
p00229_A,00229,A,a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place
p00230_A,00230,A,the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view
p00231_A,00231,A,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p00232_A,00232,A,very well i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrang in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course
p00233_A,00233,A,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p00234_A,00234,A,yes we shall indeed be known to be related to them i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them
p00235_A,00235,A,well i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place
p00236_A,00236,A,this is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar
p00237_A,00237,A,i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient
p00238_A,00238,A,for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next
p00239_A,00239,A,indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family
p00240_A,00240,A,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p00241_A,00241,A,pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance
p00242_A,00242,A,yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof
p00243_A,00243,A,i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman
p00244_A,00244,A,perhaps i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of
p00245_A,00245,A,and she besides nursing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise she always takes the right time for applying everybody s heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour s leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know one s species better one likes to hear what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat
p00246_A,00246,A,by all means only tell me all about it when you do come who is your party well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me to morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you
p00247_A,00247,A,the little durands were there i conclude with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed they never miss a concert
p00248_A,00248,A,the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them
p00249_A,00249,A,old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course
p00250_A,00250,A,oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond
p00251_A,00251,A,no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation
p00252_A,00252,A,yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together and such being the case i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time pray is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath
p00253_A,00253,A,i have been a good deal acquainted with him but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met
p00254_A,00254,A,to confess the truth that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done
p00255_A,00255,A,i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune
p00256_A,00256,A,now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis
p00257_A,00257,A,oh if these are your only objections mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin
p00258_A,00258,A,it first came into my head upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago
p00259_A,00259,A,did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday
p00260_A,00260,A,it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
p00261_A,00261,A,no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with
p00262_A,00262,A,i did
p00263_A,00263,A,yes he was not married when i knew him first
p00264_A,00264,A,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him
p00265_A,00265,A,i know it all i know it all he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put
p00266_A,00266,A,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other
p00267_A,00267,A,to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from
p00268_A,00268,A,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty
p00269_A,00269,A,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof
p00270_A,00270,A,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger
p00271_A,00271,A,i can explain this too
p00272_A,00272,A,yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis
p00273_A,00273,A,no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed
p00274_A,00274,A,i know you did i know it all perfectly but
p00275_A,00275,A,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you
p00276_A,00276,A,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do
p00277_A,00277,A,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation
p00278_A,00278,A,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p00279_A,00279,A,yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room
p00280_A,00280,A,i do not know i do not think they were
p00281_A,00281,A,no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little
p00282_A,00282,A,but i ought to have looked about me more
p00283_A,00283,A,do you see that in my eye
p00284_A,00284,A,mr elliot are you acquainted with mr elliot
p00285_A,00285,A,i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you
p00286_A,00286,A,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me
p00287_A,00287,A,no nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am
p00288_A,00288,A,my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one
p00289_A,00289,A,no i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that do tell me how it first came into your head
p00290_A,00290,A,and has it indeed been spoken of
p00291_A,00291,A,no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular
p00292_A,00292,A,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message
p00293_A,00293,A,i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years
p00294_A,00294,A,not before he was married i suppose
p00295_A,00295,A,indeed then do tell me what he was at that time of life i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man was he at all such as he appears now
p00296_A,00296,A,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man
p00297_A,00297,A,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back
p00298_A,00298,A,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot
p00299_A,00299,A,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character
p00300_A,00300,A,but was not she a very low woman
p00301_A,00301,A,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now
p00302_A,00302,A,thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now
p00303_A,00303,A,can you really
p00304_A,00304,A,colonel wallis you are acquainted with him
p00305_A,00305,A,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived
p00306_A,00306,A,indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left
p00307_A,00307,A,he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme
p00308_A,00308,A,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not
p00309_A,00309,A,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness
p00310_A,00310,A,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p00311_A,00311,A,what is this the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant
p00312_A,00312,A,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00313_A,00313,A,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p00314_A,00314,A,a well looking man a very well looking man
p00315_A,00315,A,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p00316_A,00316,A,i had not the smallest intention of asking him but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least
p00317_A,00317,A,oh i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect
p00318_A,00318,A,oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men
p00319_A,00319,A,indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty
p00320_A,00320,A,quite delightful exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son
p00321_A,00321,A,my dear miss elliot
p00322_A,00322,A,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p00323_A,00323,A,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p00324_A,00324,A,oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going
p00325_A,00325,A,and so ma am all these thing considered though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement
p00326_A,00326,A,oh dear mrs croft there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement
p00327_A,00327,A,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p00328_A,00328,A,have you finished your letter
p00329_A,00329,A,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p00330_A,00330,A,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00331_A,00331,A,here frederick you and i part company i believe i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves
p00332_A,00332,A,good morning god bless you
p00333_A,00333,A,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p00334_A,00334,A,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p00335_A,00335,A,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p00336_A,00336,A,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
p00337_A,00337,A,i hardly know
p00000_B,00000,B,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd
p00001_B,00001,B,there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description
p00002_B,00002,B,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p00003_B,00003,B,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p00004_B,00004,B,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p00005_B,00005,B,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p00006_B,00006,B,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p00007_B,00007,B,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00008_B,00008,B,and who is admiral croft
p00009_B,00009,B,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p00010_B,00010,B,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p00011_B,00011,B,oh certainly
p00012_B,00012,B,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00013_B,00013,B,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p00014_B,00014,B,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p00015_B,00015,B,the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it
p00016_B,00016,B,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p00017_B,00017,B,merely gowland
p00018_B,00018,B,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p00019_B,00019,B,certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her you see how it has carried away her freckles
p00020_B,00020,B,if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse
p00021_B,00021,B,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p00022_B,00022,B,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00023_B,00023,B,a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here
p00024_B,00024,B,no nothing at all
p00025_B,00025,B,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p00026_B,00026,B,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00027_B,00027,B,oh no that must have been quite accidental in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas
p00028_B,00028,B,is not this song worth staying for
p00029_B,00029,B,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00030_B,00030,B,bless me how very odd i shall forget my own name soon i suppose a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise very odd indeed
p00031_B,00031,B,then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath
p00032_B,00032,B,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00033_B,00033,B,there is hardly any personal defect which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to
p00034_B,00034,B,she sees nothing to blame in it on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith
p00035_B,00035,B,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00036_B,00036,B,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00037_B,00037,B,i think very differently an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me
p00038_B,00038,B,a great many things i assure you more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants are for lady russell i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave i was told that they wished it but all these things took up a great deal of time
p00039_B,00039,B,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p00040_B,00040,B,my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner
p00041_B,00041,B,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p00042_B,00042,B,i have not the smallest objection on that account i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves
p00043_B,00043,B,i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party
p00044_B,00044,B,but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy
p00045_B,00045,B,you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone it is early
p00046_B,00046,B,you have had your little boys with you
p00047_B,00047,B,did you go then i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party
p00048_B,00048,B,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p00049_B,00049,B,well you will soon be better now you know i always cure you when i come how are your neighbours at the great house
p00050_B,00050,B,oh well but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday
p00051_B,00051,B,yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell so lady russell would not get out i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer oh charles is out shooting i have not seen him since seven o clock he would go though i told him how ill i was he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning
p00052_B,00052,B,dear me what can you possibly have to do
p00053_B,00053,B,i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about i have not nerves for the sort of thing
p00054_B,00054,B,oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath
p00055_B,00055,B,nothing remarkable one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one s own mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it where shall we go i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you
p00056_B,00056,B,yes you see his papa can and why should not i jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day
p00057_B,00057,B,i never want them i assure you they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me oh anne i am so very unwell it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday
p00058_B,00058,B,yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad
p00059_B,00059,B,oh yes i went i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning it would have been strange if i had not gone
p00060_B,00060,B,are you serious dear me that s a very good thought very good indeed to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home am i and it only harasses me you who have not a mother s feelings are a great deal the properest person you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima oh i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone an excellent thought of yours indeed anne i will go and tell charles and get ready directly you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child
p00061_B,00061,B,i can give you no account of them i have not seen one of them to day except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way
p00062_B,00062,B,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00063_B,00063,B,we are expecting a brother of mrs croft s here soon i dare say you know him by name
p00064_B,00064,B,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p00065_B,00065,B,so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening i knew how it would be this is always my luck if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them very unfeeling i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy talks of his being going on so well how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried i am not at all equal to it you saw how hysterical i was yesterday
p00066_B,00066,B,charles may say what he pleases but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday i wish you had been there to see her behaviour and as to captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best but charles is so positive i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me
p00067_B,00067,B,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p00068_B,00068,B,this is very kind of anne and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child
p00069_B,00069,B,now you are talking nonsense mary it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied
p00070_B,00070,B,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p00071_B,00071,B,phoo phoo what stuff these young fellows talk never was a better sloop than the asp in her day for an old built sloop you would not see her equal lucky fellow to get her he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his
p00072_B,00072,B,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p00073_B,00073,B,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p00074_B,00074,B,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00075_B,00075,B,had you i honour you
p00076_B,00076,B,happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can but this no doubt you have been always doing it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it let those who would be happy be firm here is a nut to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere this nut while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind
p00077_B,00077,B,do you mean that she refused him
p00078_B,00078,B,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00079_B,00079,B,she would have turned back then but for you
p00080_B,00080,B,when did that happen
p00081_B,00081,B,and so ma am all these thing considered though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement
p00082_B,00082,B,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p00083_B,00083,B,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p00084_B,00084,B,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p00085_B,00085,B,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p00086_B,00086,B,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00087_B,00087,B,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p00088_B,00088,B,oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend
p00089_B,00089,B,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00090_B,00090,B,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00091_B,00091,B,but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then
p00092_B,00092,B,my dear frederick you are talking quite idly pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings
p00093_B,00093,B,but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days
p00094_B,00094,B,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p00095_B,00095,B,depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable
p00096_B,00096,B,all merged in my friendship sophia i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself
p00097_B,00097,B,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p00098_B,00098,B,now i have done
p00099_B,00099,B,nothing to the purpose you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board
p00100_B,00100,B,i might not like them the better for that perhaps such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board
p00101_B,00101,B,ay that we shall
p00102_B,00102,B,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p00103_B,00103,B,a surgeon
p00104_B,00104,B,the last hours were certainly very painful but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable
p00105_B,00105,B,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
p00106_B,00106,B,certainly i could have none but it appears i should hope it would be a very happy match there are on both sides good principles and good temper
p00107_B,00107,B,captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick he knows where a surgeon is to be found
p00108_B,00108,B,i am only waiting for mr elliot he will be here in a moment i am sure good morning to you
p00109_B,00109,B,they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say
p00110_B,00110,B,i should have thought that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this
p00111_B,00111,B,would i
p00112_B,00112,B,you were a good while at lyme i think
p00113_B,00113,B,i should very much like to see lyme again
p00114_B,00114,B,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p00115_B,00115,B,how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently
p00116_B,00116,B,oh very little nothing that i regard
p00117_B,00117,B,i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now to me she was in the place of a parent do not mistake me however i am not saying that she did not err in her advice it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman s portion
p00118_B,00118,B,oh no the usual character of them has nothing for me i am no card player
p00119_B,00119,B,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p00120_B,00120,B,i am not yet so much changed
p00121_B,00121,B,yes but there i think ends the resemblance with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing but i have no reason to suppose it so it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me a man like him in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman he ought not he does not
p00122_B,00122,B,you were not formerly i know you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes
p00123_B,00123,B,but it rains
p00124_B,00124,B,i hope the little boy is better
p00125_B,00125,B,though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair
p00126_B,00126,B,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p00127_B,00127,B,about a fortnight i could not leave it till louisa s doing well was quite ascertained i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace it had been my doing solely mine she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak the country round lyme is very fine i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire
p00128_B,00128,B,it is a period indeed eight years and a half is a period
p00129_B,00129,B,yes yes to the inn i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others
p00130_B,00130,B,oh god her father and mother
p00131_B,00131,B,i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time it was a frightful hour a frightful day the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery
p00132_B,00132,B,good god you would it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again i did not understand you i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself six years of separation and suffering might have been spared it is a sort of pain too which is new to me i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards like other great men under reverses i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve
p00133_B,00133,B,perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus but i could not i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery i had no reason to believe her of less authority now the force of habit was to be added
p00134_B,00134,B,true true a surgeon this instant
p00135_B,00135,B,no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here
p00136_B,00136,B,not yet but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time i trust to being in charity with her soon but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady my own self tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter would you in short have renewed the engagement then
p00137_B,00137,B,walter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
p00138_B,00138,B,she would indeed i am almost ashamed to say it
p00139_B,00139,B,oh yes certainly
p00140_B,00140,B,i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary i wish she had accepted him we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russell s doing that she did not they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him
p00141_B,00141,B,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p00142_B,00142,B,mary is good natured enough in many respects but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pride the elliot pride she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride we do so wish that charles had married anne instead i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne
p00143_B,00143,B,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p00144_B,00144,B,oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good
p00145_B,00145,B,well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides i do not like having such things so long in hand i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch then there would always be company for them and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other
p00146_B,00146,B,he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy but there is no saying which he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind ay this comes of the peace if it were war now he would have settled it long ago we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth
p00147_B,00147,B,very good humoured unaffected girls indeed and a very respectable family one could not be connected with better people my dear admiral that post we shall certainly take that post
p00148_B,00148,B,we had better not talk about it my dear for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together i had known you by character however long before
p00149_B,00149,B,yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london
p00150_B,00150,B,there you see just as i said heir to sir walter elliot i was sure that would come out if it was so depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes but anne only conceive how extraordinary i wish i had looked at him more i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other do you think he had the elliot countenance i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery
p00151_B,00151,B,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p00152_B,00152,B,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p00153_B,00153,B,is there no one to help me
p00154_B,00154,B,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p00155_B,00155,B,of course you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him
p00156_B,00156,B,it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved yes we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit we cannot help ourselves we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us you are forced on exertion you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions
p00157_B,00157,B,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p00158_B,00158,B,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p00159_B,00159,B,true very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick
p00160_B,00160,B,we never shall we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said
p00161_B,00161,B,no that i can easily believe
p00162_B,00162,B,and not known to him perhaps so soon
p00163_B,00163,B,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p00164_B,00164,B,oh i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long as if i may be allowed the expression so long as you have an object i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone
p00165_B,00165,B,certainly captain benwick
p00166_B,00166,B,granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick he has not been forced upon any exertion the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since
p00167_B,00167,B,ay true enough only june
p00168_B,00168,B,but how shall we prove anything
p00169_B,00169,B,no no it is not man s nature i will not allow it to be more man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved i believe the reverse i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather
p00170_B,00170,B,ah if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence i speak you know only of such men as have hearts
p00171_B,00171,B,it was not in her nature she doted on him
p00172_B,00172,B,not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm nobody could do it but that good fellow the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week that s what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us
p00173_B,00173,B,we shall never agree upon this question
p00174_B,00174,B,you are a good soul there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied
p00175_B,00175,B,yes and you may guess who it is for but it was not done for her miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him i little thought then but no matter this was drawn at the cape he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another it was a commission to me but who else was there to employ i hope i can allow for him i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another he undertakes it he is writing about it now poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon
p00176_B,00176,B,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00177_B,00177,B,yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long
p00178_B,00178,B,to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since
p00179_B,00179,B,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00180_B,00180,B,oh yes my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find money you know coming down with money two daughters at once it cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me mary does not above half like henrietta s match she never did you know but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop i cannot make her attend to the value of the property it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now
p00181_B,00181,B,that cannot be much to your taste i know but i do believe him to be an excellent young man
p00182_B,00182,B,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p00183_B,00183,B,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p00184_B,00184,B,such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove should be happy in their children s marriages they do everything to confer happiness i am sure what a blessing to young people to be in such hands your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now
p00185_B,00185,B,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p00186_B,00186,B,i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it
p00187_B,00187,B,oh when shall i leave you again
p00188_B,00188,B,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p00189_B,00189,B,certainly but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort
p00190_B,00190,B,another time sir i thank you not now
p00191_B,00191,B,indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwick s manners i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please
p00192_B,00192,B,i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man
p00193_B,00193,B,a little i am a little acquainted with captain benwick
p00194_B,00194,B,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p00195_B,00195,B,i am much obliged to you but i am not going with them the carriage would not accommodate so many i walk i prefer walking
p00196_B,00196,B,i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man and i understand that he bears an excellent character
p00197_B,00197,B,did you say that you had something to tell me sir
p00198_B,00198,B,well whenever it suits you you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door a good place is not it but you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butler s room ay so it always is i believe one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like our own best and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not we have made very few changes either very few we told you about the laundry door at uppercross that has been a very great improvement the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did so long you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better my wife should have the credit of them however i have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father s a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away from one s self so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i never go near the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place the breakfast room chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this pray say so with my compliments he will be glad to hear it
p00199_B,00199,B,that i will with all my heart and farther too yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along there take my arm that s right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there lord what a boat it is
p00200_B,00200,B,well she is to marry him nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for
p00201_B,00201,B,yes yes i understand you but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name for himself he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think poor frederick now he must begin all over again with somebody else i think we must get him to bath sophy must write and beg him to come to bath here are pretty girls enough i am sure it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath
p00202_B,00202,B,oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice
p00203_B,00203,B,yes i have presently but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however i shall not stop how d ye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife she poor soul is tied by the leg she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a three shilling piece if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother shabby fellows both of them i am glad they are not on this side of the way sophy cannot bear them they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men i will tell you the whole story another time there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife ah the peace has come too soon for that younker poor old sir archibald how do you like bath miss elliot it suits us very well we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way well now you shall hear something that will surprise you but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to her christian name i always forget her christian name ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick he was courting her week after week the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right but even then there was something odd in their way of going on instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since we have seen nothing of him since november even sophy could not understand it but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick you know james benwick
p00204_B,00204,B,well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his there is something about frederick more to our taste and the thing is certainly true it is not a mere bit of gossip we have it from frederick himself his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross i fancy they are all at uppercross
p00205_B,00205,B,not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him
p00206_B,00206,B,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p00207_B,00207,B,no i did not promise i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise
p00208_B,00208,B,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p00209_B,00209,B,now mary you know very well how it really was it was all your doing he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come that is the fact upon my honour mary knows it is oh he talks of you in such terms
p00210_B,00210,B,phoo phoo what s an evening party never worth remembering your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us you may do as you like but i shall go to the play
p00211_B,00211,B,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p00212_B,00212,B,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p00213_B,00213,B,oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go
p00214_B,00214,B,i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there i declare anne he never talks of you at all
p00215_B,00215,B,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p00216_B,00216,B,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p00217_B,00217,B,he is a man whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me
p00218_B,00218,B,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p00219_B,00219,B,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p00220_B,00220,B,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p00221_B,00221,B,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00222_B,00222,B,any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me
p00223_B,00223,B,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p00224_B,00224,B,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p00225_B,00225,B,you will not like him i will answer for it
p00226_B,00226,B,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00227_B,00227,B,no it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow
p00228_B,00228,B,yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend
p00229_B,00229,B,how is mary looking the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day
p00230_B,00230,B,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p00231_B,00231,B,and mine kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately
p00232_B,00232,B,my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification
p00233_B,00233,B,pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance
p00234_B,00234,B,yes yes i see you are i see you know nothing of the matter you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english you need not say anything more of your ignorance here is complete proof
p00235_B,00235,B,i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman
p00236_B,00236,B,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p00237_B,00237,B,i love your indignation it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him
p00238_B,00238,B,perhaps i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of
p00239_B,00239,B,i knew you by report long before you came to bath i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately i have been acquainted with you by character many years your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me the name of anne elliot has long had an interesting sound to me very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change
p00240_B,00240,B,well i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place
p00241_B,00241,B,for shame for shame this is too much flattery i forget what we are to have next
p00242_B,00242,B,indeed how so you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family
p00243_B,00243,B,yes we shall indeed be known to be related to them i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance i suppose i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them
p00244_B,00244,B,i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient
p00245_B,00245,B,i was not at all aware of this you never mentioned it before had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you
p00246_B,00246,B,can you really
p00247_B,00247,B,but i ought to have looked about me more
p00248_B,00248,B,indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left
p00249_B,00249,B,perhaps you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot
p00250_B,00250,B,he certainly did so far it is very true at lyme i happened to be at lyme
p00251_B,00251,B,and has it indeed been spoken of
p00252_B,00252,B,mr elliot are you acquainted with mr elliot
p00253_B,00253,B,but was not she a very low woman
p00254_B,00254,B,no i can readily believe all that of my cousin he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions i consider him with great respect i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me surely this must be calm enough and upon my word he is nothing to me should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him i assure you i shall not i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that do tell me how it first came into your head
p00255_B,00255,B,my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above half a year he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one
p00256_B,00256,B,i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years
p00257_B,00257,B,no that was what i dreaded it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little
p00258_B,00258,B,i do not know i do not think they were
p00259_B,00259,B,colonel wallis you are acquainted with him
p00260_B,00260,B,nay i have no particular enquiry to make about her i have always understood they were not a happy couple but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my father s acquaintance as he did my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him why did mr elliot draw back
p00261_B,00261,B,and were you much acquainted
p00262_B,00262,B,no was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid i observed no one in particular
p00263_B,00263,B,indeed my dear mrs smith i want none you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe i am more curious to know why he should be so different now
p00264_B,00264,B,i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me
p00265_B,00265,B,the whole history she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news but though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could shall i mention to him your being in bath shall i take any message
p00266_B,00266,B,yes you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine there is always something offensive in the details of cunning the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not
p00267_B,00267,B,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p00268_B,00268,B,how do you do
p00269_B,00269,B,this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night this explains it i found he had been used to hear of me i could not comprehend how what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned how sure to be mistaken but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you mr elliot married then completely for money the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character
p00270_B,00270,B,thank you this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying but why be acquainted with us now
p00271_B,00271,B,no nor next week nor next nor next i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week i am not going to marry mr elliot i should like to know why you imagine i am
p00272_B,00272,B,this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life which has always excited my particular curiosity it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times it seemed to announce a different sort of man
p00273_B,00273,B,not before he was married i suppose
p00274_B,00274,B,do you see that in my eye
p00275_B,00275,B,i am very glad to know all this it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do my line of conduct will be more direct mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness
p00276_B,00276,B,my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient this will not do mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father that was all prior to my coming to bath i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived
p00277_B,00277,B,yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room
p00278_B,00278,B,to confess the truth that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have i want you to talk about me to mr elliot i want your interest with him he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done
p00279_B,00279,B,my dear there was nothing else to be done i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless he was very unkind to his first wife they were wretched together but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her i was willing to hope that you must fare better
p00280_B,00280,B,yes i do your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together and such being the case i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time pray is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me does he know that i am in bath
p00281_B,00281,B,no it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed
p00282_B,00282,B,i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon i ought to have waited for official information but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak next week to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune
p00283_B,00283,B,i know you did i know it all perfectly but
p00284_B,00284,B,did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday
p00285_B,00285,B,oh those things are too common when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct we lived for enjoyment i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing to do the best for himself passed as a duty
p00286_B,00286,B,it first came into my head upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago
p00287_B,00287,B,but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it the language i know is highly disrespectful though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning but it shows you the man mark his professions to my poor husband can any thing be stronger
p00288_B,00288,B,i know it all i know it all he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put
p00289_B,00289,B,no no you were better employed you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening i see it in your eye i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to in the intervals of the concert it was conversation
p00290_B,00290,B,oh you saw enough for your own amusement i can understand there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond
p00291_B,00291,B,i can explain this too
p00292_B,00292,B,yes he was not married when i knew him first
p00293_B,00293,B,no i thank you no certainly not in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with
p00294_B,00294,B,to be sure i did very often i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from
p00295_B,00295,B,now how i do wish i understood you how i do wish i knew what you were at i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers but why should you be cruel let me plead for my present friend i cannot call him but for my former friend where can you look for a more suitable match where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man let me recommend mr elliot i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis
p00296_B,00296,B,i did
p00297_B,00297,B,yes i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing he is no hypocrite now he truly wants to marry you his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis
p00298_B,00298,B,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now
p00299_B,00299,B,the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them
p00300_B,00300,B,yes which i objected to but he would not regard money money was all that he wanted her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof
p00301_B,00301,B,oh if these are your only objections mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him do not forget me when you are married that s all let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin
p00302_B,00302,B,mr elliot at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law he was determined to make it by marriage he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you he told me the whole story he had no concealments with me it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other
p00303_B,00303,B,i have not seen mr elliot these three years i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you there were many things to be taken into the account one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliot s real character though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen you might some time or other be differently affected towards him hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character he has no feeling for others those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion oh he is black at heart hollow and black my expressions startle you you must allow for an injured angry woman but i will try to command myself i will not abuse him i will only tell you what i have found him facts shall speak he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself the intimacy had been formed before our marriage i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together we were principally in town living in very good style he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him
p00304_B,00304,B,i have been a good deal acquainted with him but it seems worn out now it is a great while since we met
p00305_B,00305,B,well grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me my account states that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do
p00306_B,00306,B,only give me a hearing you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm nobody supposes that you were his first inducement he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you so says my historian at least is this true did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you
p00307_B,00307,B,old lady mary maclean i need not ask after her she never misses i know and you must have seen her she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course
p00308_B,00308,B,it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
p00309_B,00309,B,lessening i understand he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it said she and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs wallis s recommendation
p00310_B,00310,B,i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother s place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me you are your mother s self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life
p00311_B,00311,B,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p00312_B,00312,B,have they any acquaintance here
p00313_B,00313,B,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p00314_B,00314,B,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p00315_B,00315,B,no i just know his name a bowing acquaintance wentworth captain wentworth of the navy his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch
p00316_B,00316,B,indeed i do say it i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation poor man i was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty
p00317_B,00317,B,quite delightful exactly like father and son dear miss elliot may i not say father and son
p00318_B,00318,B,my dear miss elliot
p00319_B,00319,B,oh i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together they appear to so much advantage in company with each other each behaving so pleasantly mr elliot looking up with so much respect
p00320_B,00320,B,oh i lay no embargo on any body s words if you will have such ideas but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men
p00321_B,00321,B,well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him i did invite him you know i sent him away with smiles when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him
p00322_B,00322,B,if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps
p00323_B,00323,B,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p00324_B,00324,B,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p00325_B,00325,B,yes dear ma am or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can
p00326_B,00326,B,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p00327_B,00327,B,oh dear mrs croft there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement it is what i always protested against for my children it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement
p00328_B,00328,B,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p00329_B,00329,B,good morning god bless you
p00330_B,00330,B,there is no hurry on my side i am only ready whenever you are i am in very good anchorage here well supplied and want for nothing no hurry for a signal at all well miss elliot as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point no man and woman would probably but let me observe that all histories are against you all stories prose and verse if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman s inconstancy songs and proverbs all talk of woman s fickleness but perhaps you will say these were all written by men
p00331_B,00331,B,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00332_B,00332,B,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p00333_B,00333,B,to be sure i will if you wish it charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss anne s message but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy captain harville holds himself quite engaged i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say
p00334_B,00334,B,oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word captain harville has no thought but of going
p00335_B,00335,B,i found that i was considered by harville an engaged man that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment i was startled and shocked to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the same her own family nay perhaps herself i was no longer at my own disposal i was hers in honour if she wished it i had been unguarded i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences i was six weeks with edward and saw him happy i could have no other pleasure i deserved none he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter here ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive with some degree of hope you were single it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me to see you in the midst of those who could not be my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared how could i look on without agony was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done was it not all against me
p00336_B,00336,B,i hardly know
p00337_B,00337,B,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
