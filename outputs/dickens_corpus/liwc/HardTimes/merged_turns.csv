454,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],difficult to answer it yes or no father,527,527,Q527
455,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced,528,529,"Q528,Q529"
456,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],what would you advise me to use in its stead father,530,530,Q530
457,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears,531,531,Q531
458,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression,532,532,Q532
459,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that,533,533,Q533
460,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],shall i marry him,534,534,Q534
461,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women,535,535,Q535
462,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],no father i do not,536,536,Q536
463,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa,537,538,"Q537,Q538"
464,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father,539,539,Q539
465,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark,540,540,Q540
466,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],father i have often thought that life is very short,541,541,Q541
467,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact,542,542,Q542
468,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],i speak of my own life father,543,543,Q543
469,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate,544,544,Q544
470,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter,545,545,Q545
471,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],how matter what matter my dear,546,546,Q546
472,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not,547,547,Q547
473,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],certainly my dear,548,548,Q548
474,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said,549,549,Q549
475,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child,550,550,Q550
476,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],none father what does it matter,551,551,Q551
477,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal,552,552,Q552
478,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences,553,553,Q553

480,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped,555,555,Q555
481,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],my dear quite true quite true,556,556,Q556
482,Louisa Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear,557,557,Q557
483,Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],my dear louisa you abundantly repay my care kiss me my dear girl i may assure you now my favourite child that i am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived mr bounderby is a very remarkable man and what little disparity can be said to exist between you if any is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired it has always been my object so to educate you as that you might while still in your early youth be if i may so express myself almost any age kiss me once more louisa now let us go and find your mother,558,559,"Q558,Q559"

1170,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child,1348,1348,Q1348
1171,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],you d like to keep her here for a time,1349,1349,Q1349
1172,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts,1350,1350,Q1350
1173,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself,1351,1351,Q1351
1174,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her,1352,1352,Q1352
1175,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me,1353,1353,Q1353
1176,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone,1354,1354,Q1354
1177,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope,1355,1355,Q1355
1178,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],bounderby this is unreasonable,1356,1356,Q1356
1179,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this,1357,1358,"Q1357,Q1358"
1180,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],not i fear to spare me,1359,1359,Q1359
1181,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it,1360,1360,Q1360
1182,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],bounderby the less we say to night the better i think,1361,1361,Q1361
1183,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now,1362,1363,"Q1362,Q1363"

1186,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects,1366,1366,Q1366
1187,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility,1367,1367,Q1367

1189,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],what made you think of this,1369,1369,Q1369
1190,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for,1370,1370,Q1370
1191,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out,1371,1371,Q1371
1192,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa,1372,1372,Q1372
1193,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark,1373,1373,Q1373
1194,Thomas Gradgrind,['Josiah Bounderby'],let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision,1374,1374,Q1374
1195,Josiah Bounderby,['Thomas Gradgrind'],i always come to a decision and whatever i do i do at once i should be surprised at tom gradgrind s addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown knowing what he knows of him if i could be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug i have given you my decision and i have got no more to say good night,1375,1375,Q1375
