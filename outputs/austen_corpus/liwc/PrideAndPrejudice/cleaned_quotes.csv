Q0,my dear mr bennet have you heard that netherfield park is let at last,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1,but it is for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q2,do not you want to know who has taken it,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q3,you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q4,why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q5,what is his name,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q6,bingley,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']

Q8,oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q9,how so how can it affect them,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q10,my dear mr bennet how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q11,is that his design in settling here,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q12,design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q13,i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q14,my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q15,in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q16,but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q17,it is more than i engage for i assure you,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q18,but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q19,you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q20,i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q21,they have none of them much to recommend them they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q22,mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q23,you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q24,ah you do not know what i suffer,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q25,but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q26,it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q27,depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q28,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q29,we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes since we are not to visit,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q30,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q31,i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q32,no more have i and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q33,don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q34,kitty has no discretion in her coughs she times them ill,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q35,i do not cough for my own amusement,Kitty,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q36,to morrow fortnight,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q37,aye so it is and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q38,then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q39,impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q40,i honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q41,nonsense nonsense,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q42,what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q43,while mary is adjusting her ideas let us return to mr bingley,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q44,i am sick of mr bingley,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q45,i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q46,how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q47,now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q48,what an excellent father you have girls i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty']"
Q49,oh i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q50,if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q51,come darcy i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance,Mr. Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q52,i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with,Mr. Darcy,['Mr. Bingley']
Q53,i would not be so fastidious as you are for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty,Mr. Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q54,you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,Mr. Darcy,['Mr. Bingley']
Q55,oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you,Mr. Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q56,which do you mean she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me,Mr. Darcy,['Mr. Bingley']
Q57,oh my dear mr bennet,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q58,we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q59,if he had had any compassion for me he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q60,oh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst s gown,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q61,but i can assure you that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q62,he is just what a young man ought to be sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q63,he is also handsome which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q64,i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q65,did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q66,dear lizzy,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q67,oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q68,i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q69,i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q70,certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q71,you began the evening well charlotte you were mr bingley s first choice,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q72,yes but he seemed to like his second better,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q73,oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q74,perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q75,upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q76,my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q77,i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q78,are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her,Jane,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Maria']"
Q79,aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q80,miss bingley told me,Jane,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'A Young Lucas', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q81,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable,Jane,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'A Young Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q82,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q83,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q84,another time lizzy i would not dance with him if i were you,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q85,i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q86,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q87,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'A Young Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q88,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us,Mary,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'A Young Lucas', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q89,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day,A Young Lucas,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q90,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'A Young Lucas', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q91,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q92,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q93,remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q94,but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q95,perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q96,your plan is a good one where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q97,not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q98,yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q99,well i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q100,you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q101,what does mr darcy mean by listening to my conversation with colonel forster,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q102,that is a question which mr darcy only can answer,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q103,but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q104,did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q105,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q106,you are severe on us,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q107,it will be her turn soon to be teazed i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows,Charlotte Lucas,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q108,you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers very well if it must be so it must there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q109,what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q110,certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance,Mr. Darcy,['Sir William Lucas']
Q111,your friend performs delightfully and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q112,you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir,Mr. Darcy,['Sir William Lucas']
Q113,yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james s,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q114,never sir,Mr. Darcy,['Sir William Lucas']
Q115,do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q116,it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it,Mr. Darcy,['Sir William Lucas']
Q117,you have a house in town i conclude,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q118,i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas,Sir William Lucas,['Mr. Darcy']
Q119,my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you,Sir William Lucas,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q120,indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner,Elizabeth,"['Sir William Lucas', 'Mr. Darcy']"
Q121,you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour,Sir William Lucas,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q122,mr darcy is all politeness,Elizabeth,"['Sir William Lucas', 'Mr. Darcy']"
Q123,he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner,Sir William Lucas,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q124,i can guess the subject of your reverie,Miss Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q125,i should imagine not,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q126,you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them,Miss Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q127,your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q128,miss elizabeth bennet,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q129,miss elizabeth bennet i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy,Miss Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q130,that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q131,nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you,Miss Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q132,from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q133,i am astonished my dear that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of any body s children it should not be of my own however,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q134,if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q135,yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q136,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q137,my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q138,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q139,well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q140,it is from miss bingley,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q141,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q142,dining out that is very unlucky,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q143,can i have the carriage,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q144,no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q145,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home,Elizabeth,"['Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q146,oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"

Q195,all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"

Q197,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q198,nor i i am sure,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q199,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q200,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q201,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"

Q206,eliza bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"

Q210,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Kitty']"
Q211,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q212,whatever i do is done in a hurry and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q213,that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q214,you begin to comprehend me do you,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q215,oh yes i understand you perfectly,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q216,i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q217,that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q218,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"

Q222,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q223,yes indeed i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q224,i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"

Q226,seemed to think the country was nothing at all,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q227,indeed mama you are mistaken you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q228,certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q229,yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q230,did charlotte dine with you,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"

Q232,she seems a very pleasant young woman,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q233,oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q234,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q235,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q236,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q237,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q238,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not,Lydia,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q239,how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q240,you write uncommonly fast,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q241,you are mistaken i write rather slowly,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q242,how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year letters of business too how odious i should think them,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q243,it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q244,pray tell your sister that i long to see her,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q245,i have already told her so once by your desire,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q246,i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"

Q248,how can you contrive to write so even,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q249,tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q250,will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q251,oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q252,they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q253,it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q254,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q255,my style of writing is very different from yours,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q256,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst']"
Q257,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q258,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q259,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q260,and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q261,the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q262,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q263,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q264,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q265,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q266,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q267,upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q268,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q269,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q270,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q271,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q272,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q273,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q274,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q275,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q276,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q277,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q278,oh i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q279,indeed i do not dare,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q280,i hope you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses,Miss Bingley,['Mr. Darcy']
Q281,have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q282,oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes,Miss Bingley,[]
Q283,it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied,Mr. Darcy,['Miss Bingley']
Q284,i did not know that you intended to walk,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst']"
Q285,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out,Mrs. Hurst,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q286,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q287,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q288,very glad,Mr. Hurst,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q289,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q290,by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q291,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q292,i should like balls infinitely better if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q293,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q294,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q295,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it,Elizabeth,['Miss Bingley']
Q296,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q297,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q298,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q299,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q300,mr darcy is not to be laughed at that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q301,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q302,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q303,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q304,such as vanity and pride,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q305,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q306,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley']"
Q307,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q308,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q309,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q310,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q311,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q312,and yours is wilfully to misunderstand them,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley']"
Q313,do let us have a little music louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane']"
Q314,i hope my dear that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q315,who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q316,the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q317,a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q318,it is not mr bingley it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q319,about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q320,oh my dear i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q321,it certainly is a most iniquitous affair and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q322,no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q323,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q324,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q325,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit,Jane,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q326,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q327,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q328,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed,Mary,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q329,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q330,you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q331,ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q332,i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q333,that is all very proper and civil i am sure and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q334,the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q335,i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q336,she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q337,ah then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q338,she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q339,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q340,her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q341,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q342,they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q343,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q344,i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q345,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Collins']
Q346,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mrs. Philips', 'George Wickham', 'Mr. Philips']"
Q347,about a month he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q348,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q349,you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q350,as much as i ever wish to be i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q351,i have no right to give my opinion as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q352,upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q353,i cannot pretend to be sorry that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q354,i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q355,i wonder whether he is likely to be in this country much longer,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q356,i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q357,oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q358,it was the prospect of constant society and good society which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q359,indeed,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q360,yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q361,good heavens but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q362,there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recal nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q363,this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q364,some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q365,but what can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q366,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q367,i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q368,i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q369,i will not trust myself on the subject i can hardly be just to him,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q370,to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q371,we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q372,how strange how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q373,it is wonderful for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q374,can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q375,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q376,what sort of a girl is miss darcy,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q377,i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q378,i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q379,not at all,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q380,he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q381,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q382,i know very well madam that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mrs. Philips', 'George Wickham']"
Q383,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q384,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q385,no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q386,her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q387,mr collins speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q388,i believe her to be both in a great degree i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q389,they have both been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q390,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q391,laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q392,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q393,it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q394,i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q395,while i can have my mornings to myself it is enough i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body,Mary,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q396,i am by no means of opinion i assure you that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q397,i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here,Mr. Denney,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia']"
Q398,i dare say you will find him very agreeable,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q399,heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q400,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q401,very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q402,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q403,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q404,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q405,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q406,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q407,i must not decide on my own performance,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q408,when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q409,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q410,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q411,i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me,Sir William Lucas,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q412,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q413,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q414,what think you of books,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q415,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q416,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q417,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q418,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q419,yes always,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q420,i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q421,i am,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q422,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q423,i hope not,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q424,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q425,may i ask to what these questions tend,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q426,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q427,and what is your success,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q428,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q429,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q430,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q431,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q432,so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcy s steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better,Miss Bingley,['Elizabeth']
Q433,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself,Elizabeth,['Miss Bingley']
Q434,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant,Miss Bingley,['Elizabeth']
Q435,insolent girl you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy,Elizabeth,['Elizabeth']
Q436,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q437,no i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q438,mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q439,no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q440,this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q441,he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q442,i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q443,i have found out by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q444,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Collins', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q445,indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q446,my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q447,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q448,what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Lady Lucas']"
Q449,for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing,Elizabeth,"['Lady Lucas', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q450,that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit,Mr. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Mr. Collins', 'Miss Bingley', 'Lady Lucas']"
Q451,if i were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Hurst', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Jane', 'Miss Bingley', 'Lady Lucas', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q452,lord how tired i am,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr. Darcy', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q453,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q454,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q455,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q456,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q457,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q458,my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q459,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them,Elizabeth,['Mr. Collins']
Q460,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q461,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,Elizabeth,['Mr. Collins']
Q462,were it certain that lady catherine would think so but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q463,indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled,Elizabeth,['Mr. Collins']
Q464,when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q465,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one,Elizabeth,['Mr. Collins']
Q466,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q467,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart,Elizabeth,['Mr. Collins']
Q468,you are uniformly charming and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q469,but depend upon it mr collins that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Collins']
Q470,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity,Mr. Collins,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q471,sir you quite misunderstand me lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Collins']
Q472,oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q473,i have not the pleasure of understanding you of what are you talking,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q474,of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q475,and what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless business,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q476,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q477,let her be called down she shall hear my opinion,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q478,come here child i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q479,very well and this offer of marriage you have refused,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q480,i have sir,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Bennet', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q481,very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is not it so mrs bennet,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q482,yes or i will never see her again,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q483,an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q484,what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q485,my dear i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet']"
Q486,i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him,Lydia,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q487,pray do my dear miss lucas for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves,Mrs. Bennet,"['Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty']"
Q488,aye there she comes looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty']"
Q489,now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q490,oh mr collins,Mrs. Bennet,"['Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q491,my dear madam let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me,Mr. Collins,"['Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q492,to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise,Mr. Collins,"['Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Charlotte Lucas']"
Q493,i found as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q494,this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q495,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q496,caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q497,it is evident by this that he comes back no more this winter,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q498,it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q499,why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q500,what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q501,yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q502,most willingly,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q503,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q504,indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q505,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q506,that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q507,but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q508,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q509,how can you talk so you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q510,i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q511,but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q512,it keeps him in good humour and i am more obliged to you than i can express,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q513,my dear madam this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q514,but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q515,my dear sir i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q516,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q517,believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth,Mr. Collins,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q518,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q519,why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q520,i see what you are feeling you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q521,undoubtedly,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q522,good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Sir William Lucas']"
Q523,indeed mr bennet it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q524,my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q525,i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q526,what should not you mind,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q527,i should not mind any thing at all,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q528,let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q529,i never can be thankful mr bennet for any thing about the entail how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else,Mrs. Bennet,['Mr. Bennet']
Q530,i leave it to yourself to determine,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q531,oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q532,you doubt me indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q533,i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q534,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q535,nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q536,my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q537,to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q538,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q539,and men take care that they should,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q540,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q541,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q542,and do you impute it to either of those,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q543,yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q544,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q545,yes in conjunction with his friend,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q546,i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q547,your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q548,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q549,so lizzy your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q550,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q551,true but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q552,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Kitty']"
Q553,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q554,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q555,but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q556,i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q557,oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q558,i hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q559,and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q560,so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q561,she will drop the acquaintance entirely,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q562,you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q563,my dear aunt this is being serious indeed,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q564,yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q565,well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q566,elizabeth you are not serious now,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q567,i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q568,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q569,as i did the other day very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q570,wished they might be happy,Mrs. Bennet,[]
Q571,i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q572,that you certainly shall,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q573,and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q574,we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire,Elizabeth,['Charlotte Lucas']
Q575,i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q576,my father and maria are to come to me in march and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them,Charlotte Lucas,['Elizabeth']
Q577,but my dear elizabeth what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q578,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q579,if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q580,she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q581,but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q582,no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q583,but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q584,a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q585,her not objecting does not justify him it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q586,well have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q587,no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q588,oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q589,take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q590,we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us but perhaps to the lakes,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q591,my dear dear aunt what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q592,yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q593,lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed and a most attentive neighbour,Charlotte Lucas,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Collins', 'Maria']"
Q594,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q595,oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment,Maria,['Elizabeth']
Q596,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter,Elizabeth,['Maria']
Q597,la my dear it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small,Maria,['Elizabeth']
Q598,she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in,Elizabeth,['Maria']
Q599,oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in,Maria,['Elizabeth']
Q600,i like her appearance she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife,Elizabeth,['Maria']
Q601,i confess that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Sir William Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q602,i am the less surprised at what has happened from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon,Sir William Lucas,"['Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins', 'Maria']"
Q603,do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q604,your father s estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family do you play and sing miss bennet,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q605,a little,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q606,oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q607,one of them does,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q608,why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as your s do you draw,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q609,no not at all,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q610,what none of you,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q611,not one,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q612,that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q613,my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q614,has your governess left you,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q615,we never had any governess,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q616,no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q617,then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q618,compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q619,aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q620,said she,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q621,are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q622,yes ma am all,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q623,all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q624,yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q625,upon my word you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q626,with three younger sisters grown up your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q627,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q628,i am not one and twenty,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Jenkinson', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Miss De Bourgh', 'Maria']"
Q629,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me,Charlotte Lucas,"['Elizabeth', 'Maria']"
Q630,my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q631,what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q632,we are speaking of music madam,Colonel Fitzwilliam,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh']"
Q633,of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q634,i am very glad to hear such a good account of her and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q635,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q636,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q637,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q638,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q639,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q640,i am not afraid of you,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q641,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers,Colonel Fitzwilliam,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q642,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q643,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q644,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q645,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q646,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q647,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble,Colonel Fitzwilliam,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth']"
Q648,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q649,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q650,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q651,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Colonel Fitzwilliam']"
Q652,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q653,perfectly so i thank you,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q654,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q655,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q656,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q657,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q658,this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q659,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q660,mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q661,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q662,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q663,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q664,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q665,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q666,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q667,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q668,you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q669,are you pleased with kent,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q670,what can be the meaning of this my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way,Charlotte Lucas,"['Elizabeth', 'Maria']"
Q671,i did not know before that you ever walked this way,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q672,i have been making the tour of the park as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q673,no i should have turned in a moment,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q674,do you certainly leave kent on saturday,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q675,yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q676,and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q677,he likes to have his own way very well but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q678,in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q679,these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q680,unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q681,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q682,is this meant for me,Elizabeth,[]
Q683,and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q684,i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q685,no that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q686,are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q687,you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q688,i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q689,oh yes mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q690,care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q691,what is it you mean,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q692,it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q693,you may depend upon my not mentioning it,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q694,and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q695,did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q696,i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q697,and what arts did he use to separate them,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q698,he did not talk to me of his own arts he only told me what i have now told you,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q699,i am thinking of what you have been telling me your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q700,you are rather disposed to call his interference officious,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q701,i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case,Elizabeth,['Colonel Fitzwilliam']
Q702,that is not an unnatural surmise but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q703,there were some very strong objections against the lady,Colonel Fitzwilliam,['Elizabeth']
Q704,to jane herself there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach,Elizabeth,[]
Q705,in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q706,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q707,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q708,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q709,i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q710,can you deny that you have done it,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q711,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q712,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q713,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q714,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q715,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q716,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q717,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q718,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q719,you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q720,from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q721,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q722,i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q723,this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood,Elizabeth,[]
Q724,how despicably have i acted i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself,Elizabeth,[]
Q725,i assure you i feel it exceedingly i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q726,but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q727,i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday,Elizabeth,"['Anne De Bourgh', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q728,why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q729,but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return,Elizabeth,"['Anne De Bourgh', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q730,oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q731,you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan,Elizabeth,"['Anne De Bourgh', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q732,mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q733,my uncle is to send a servant for us,Elizabeth,"['Anne De Bourgh', 'Lady Catherine De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q734,oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,"['Elizabeth', 'Anne De Bourgh', 'Charlotte Lucas', 'Mr. Collins']"
Q735,i know not miss elizabeth whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q736,it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q737,you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other,Mr. Collins,['Elizabeth']
Q738,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here,Mr. Collins,"['Elizabeth', 'Maria']"
Q739,good gracious it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened,Maria,['Elizabeth']
Q740,a great many indeed,Elizabeth,['Maria']
Q741,we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell,Maria,['Elizabeth']
Q742,and how much i shall have to conceal,Elizabeth,[]
Q743,and we mean to treat you all but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q744,oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q745,are they indeed,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Kitty', 'Maria', 'Lydia']"
Q746,they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q747,yes that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton,Elizabeth,[]
Q748,now i have got some news for you what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q749,aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q750,and mary king is safe safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Kitty', 'Maria', 'Lydia']"
Q751,she is a great fool for going away if she liked him,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q752,but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Maria']"
Q753,i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q754,how nicely we are crammed in i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but col and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Maria']"
Q755,i am glad you are come back lizzy,Mr. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Lady Lucas', 'Sir William Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q756,oh mary i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'Lady Lucas', 'Sir William Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q757,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book,Mary,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'Lady Lucas', 'Sir William Lucas', 'Maria']"
Q758,his being so sure of succeeding was wrong and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q759,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q760,blame you oh no,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q761,but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q762,no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q763,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q764,this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q765,i do not know when i have been more shocked wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q766,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q767,poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q768,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q769,i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q770,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q771,lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q772,indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q773,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q774,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q775,surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q776,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q777,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q778,and then if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value,Elizabeth,[]
Q779,well lizzy what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q780,i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q781,oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q782,well lizzy and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q783,no nothing at all,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q784,a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q785,it was a subject which they could not mention before me,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q786,no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q787,i am sure i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q788,i am sure i shall break mine,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q789,if one could but go to brighton,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q790,oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q791,and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,Kitty,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Lydia']"
Q792,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older,Kitty,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q793,lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q794,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q795,already arisen what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q796,indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q797,do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q798,how long did you say that he was at rosings,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q799,nearly three weeks,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q800,and you saw him frequently,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q801,yes almost every day,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q802,his manners are very different from his cousin s,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q803,yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q804,indeed and pray may i ask is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope that he is improved in essentials,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q805,oh no in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q806,when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood,Elizabeth,['George Wickham']
Q807,you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']
Q808,but it is fortunate that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation,Elizabeth,[]
Q809,but surely i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me,Elizabeth,[]
Q810,my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q811,if it were merely a fine house richly furnished i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q812,and of this place i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them,Elizabeth,[]
Q813,but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q814,he is now gone into the army but i am afraid he has turned out very wild,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q815,and that is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q816,i have heard much of your master s fine person it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q817,does that young lady know mr darcy,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q818,a little,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner', 'Mrs. Reynolds']"
Q819,and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q820,yes very handsome,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner', 'Mrs. Reynolds']"
Q821,i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q822,and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q823,oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q824,is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q825,not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q826,except when she goes to ramsgate,Elizabeth,[]
Q827,if your master would marry you might see more of him,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q828,yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q829,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner', 'Mrs. Reynolds']"
Q830,i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q831,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q832,yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q833,can this be mr darcy,Elizabeth,[]
Q834,his father was an excellent man,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Reynolds', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q835,yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q836,he is the best landlord and the best master that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q837,in what an amiable light does this place him,Elizabeth,[]
Q838,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q839,perhaps we might be deceived,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q840,that is not very likely our authority was too good,Mrs. Gardiner,['Elizabeth']
Q841,he is certainly a good brother,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner', 'Mrs. Reynolds']"
Q842,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her,Mrs. Reynolds,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q843,delightful charming,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q844,what will be his surprise when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion,Elizabeth,[]
Q845,why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me,Elizabeth,[]
Q846,for your housekeeper informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Darcy', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q847,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton,Mr. Darcy,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q848,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q849,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q850,i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q851,to be sure lizzy he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q852,but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q853,from what we have seen of him i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q854,it is above eight months we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield,Mr. Bingley,['Elizabeth']
Q855,pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family,Miss Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Miss Darcy']"
Q856,how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again,Miss Bingley,"['Miss Darcy', 'Mr. Darcy']"
Q857,for my own part i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable,Miss Bingley,"['Miss Darcy', 'Mr. Darcy']"
Q858,i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time,Miss Bingley,"['Miss Darcy', 'Mr. Darcy']"
Q859,yes but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance,Mr. Darcy,"['Miss Bingley', 'Miss Darcy']"
Q860,oh where where is my uncle,Elizabeth,['Elizabeth']
Q861,i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q862,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q863,let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q864,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q865,i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q866,when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q867,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q868,oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q869,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q870,my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q871,when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q872,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q873,oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q874,but what is to be done about pemberley john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q875,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q876,that is all settled,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q877,and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was,Mrs. Gardiner,['Mrs. Gardiner']
Q878,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q879,do you really think so,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q880,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q881,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q882,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q883,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q884,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q885,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q886,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q887,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q888,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q889,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q890,and do you really know all this,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q891,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q892,but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q893,oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q894,when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other,Mrs. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q895,not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites,Elizabeth,"['Mrs. Gardiner', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q896,not yet but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q897,is my father in town,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q898,yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q899,and have you heard from him often,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q900,we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q901,and my mother how is she how are you all,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q902,my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q903,but you how are you you look pale how much you must have gone through,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q904,if i had been able to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Jane', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q905,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,Mr. Gardiner,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Mrs. Gardiner']"
Q906,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Gardiner', 'Jane', 'Mr. Gardiner']"
Q907,this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation,Mary,['Elizabeth']
Q908,unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex,Mary,['Elizabeth']
Q909,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q910,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q911,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q912,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q913,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q914,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q915,but not before they went to brighton,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q916,no i believe not,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q917,and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q918,i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q919,oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q920,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q921,could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q922,he brought it with him for us to see,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q923,oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q924,i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q925,oh jane was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q926,i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q927,your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q928,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q929,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q930,he meant i believe to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q931,a gamester this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it,Jane,[]
Q932,what is he coming home and without poor lydia sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away,Mrs. Bennet,[]
Q933,say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty']"
Q934,you must not be too severe upon yourself,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q935,you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty']"
Q936,do you suppose them to be in london,Elizabeth,"['Mr. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q937,yes where else can they be so well concealed,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty']"
Q938,and lydia used to want to go to london,Kitty,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q939,she is happy then and her residence there will probably be of some duration,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty']"
Q940,lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty']"
Q941,this is a parade which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q942,i am not going to run away papa if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia,Kitty,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q943,you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q944,well well do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"
Q945,i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask,Mrs. Hill,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q946,what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Hill']"
Q947,dear madam don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter,Mrs. Hill,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q948,if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse,Butler,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q949,oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q950,yes i have had a letter from him by express,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q951,well and what news does it bring good or bad,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q952,what is there of good to be expected but perhaps you would like to read it,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q953,read it aloud for i hardly know myself what it is about,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q954,then it is as i always hoped they are married,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q955,is it possible can it be possible that he will marry her,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q956,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q957,and have you answered the letter,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q958,no but it must be done soon,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q959,oh my dear father come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q960,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q961,i dislike it very much but it must be done,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q962,and may i ask but the terms i suppose must be complied with,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q963,complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q964,and they must marry yet he is such a man,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q965,yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q966,money my uncle what do you mean sir,Jane,"['Elizabeth', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q967,i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q968,that is very true though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q969,no wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q970,ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q971,and they are really to be married how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q972,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q973,if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q974,we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q975,their conduct has been such as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q976,just as you please,Mr. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q977,may we take my uncle s letter to read to her,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"

Q980,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money,Jane,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty']"
Q981,well it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane']"

Q984,mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn,Mr. Bennet,['Mrs. Bennet']

Q986,only think of its being three months since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'George Wickham']"
Q987,oh mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'George Wickham']"

Q992,i should like it beyond any thing,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Lydia', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet', 'George Wickham']"
Q993,and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over,Lydia,"['Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'George Wickham']"
Q994,i thank you for my share of the favour but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands,Elizabeth,"['Mary', 'Lydia', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet', 'George Wickham']"
Q995,lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q996,no really i think there cannot be too little said on the subject,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Lydia']"

Q998,well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well,Lydia,"['Elizabeth', 'Jane']"
Q999,mr darcy,Elizabeth,"['Jane', 'Lydia']"

Q1027,exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent,George Wickham,['Elizabeth']

Q1124,miss bennet you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1125,if you believed it impossible to be true i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1126,at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1127,your coming to longbourn to see me and my family will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']

Q1129,i never heard that it was,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1130,and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']

Q1133,your ladyship has declared it to be impossible,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1134,it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1135,if i have i shall be the last person to confess it,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1136,miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1137,but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1138,let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1139,only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1140,the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her s while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1141,yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1142,because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1143,these are heavy misfortunes but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1144,obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1145,let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any person s whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1146,that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1147,i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1148,in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1149,true you are a gentleman s daughter but who was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1150,whatever my connections may be if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1151,tell me once for all are you engaged to him,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1152,i am not,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1153,and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1154,i will make no promise of the kind,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1155,miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1156,and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1157,not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1158,you can now have nothing farther to say you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1159,you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1160,lady catherine i have nothing farther to say you know my sentiments,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1161,you are then resolved to have him,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1162,i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1163,it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1164,neither duty nor honour nor gratitude have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn,Elizabeth,['Lady Catherine De Bourgh']
Q1165,and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1166,i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased,Lady Catherine De Bourgh,['Elizabeth']
Q1167,she did not choose it she would go,Elizabeth,['Mrs. Bennet']
Q1168,she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1169,if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all,Elizabeth,['Elizabeth']
Q1170,lizzy i was going to look for you come into my room,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1171,i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1172,you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1173,from mr collins and what can he have to say,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1174,something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1175,can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1176,have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1177,mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1178,are you not diverted,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1179,oh yes pray read on,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1180,mr collins moreover adds,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1181,that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1182,oh i am excessively diverted but it is so strange,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1183,yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1184,mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1185,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1186,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1187,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1188,you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1189,it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1190,yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1191,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1192,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1193,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1194,those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1195,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1196,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1197,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1198,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1199,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1200,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1201,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1202,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1203,had you then persuaded yourself that i should,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1204,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1205,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1206,hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1207,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1208,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1209,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1210,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1211,i must ask whether you were surprised,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1212,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1213,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1214,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1215,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1216,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1217,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1218,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1219,my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1220,you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1221,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1222,oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1223,you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1224,good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1225,there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1226,very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1227,oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1228,what do you mean,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1229,why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1230,my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1231,it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley,Elizabeth,['Jane']
Q1232,now i am quite happy for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you,Jane,['Elizabeth']
Q1233,good gracious if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way,Mrs. Bennet,"['Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q1234,mr bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q1235,i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view,Mrs. Bennet,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Kitty', 'Jane', 'Mr. Bingley', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q1236,it may do very well for the others but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty,Mr. Bingley,"['Mr. Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Mrs. Bennet', 'Kitty', 'Mr. Bennet']"
Q1237,i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1238,go to your father he wants you in the library,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1239,lizzy what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1240,or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1241,have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1242,none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1243,i do i do like him i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms,Elizabeth,['Mr. Bennet']
Q1244,lizzy i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1245,well my dear i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1246,this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1247,if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1248,good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1249,my dearest child i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow,Mrs. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1250,i admire all my three sons in law highly wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s,Mr. Bennet,['Elizabeth']
Q1251,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1252,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1253,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1254,for the liveliness of your mind i did,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1255,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1256,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1257,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1258,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1259,but i was embarrassed,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1260,and so was i,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1261,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1262,a man who had felt less might,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1263,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1264,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1265,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1266,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1267,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
Q1268,i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly,Mr. Darcy,['Elizabeth']
Q1269,and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected,Elizabeth,['Mr. Darcy']
