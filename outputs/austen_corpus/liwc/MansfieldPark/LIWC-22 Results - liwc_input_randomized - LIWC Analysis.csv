p00016_A,00016,A,my dear sir thomas i perfectly comprehend you and do justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct and i entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one s own hands and i am sure i should be the last person in the world to withhold my mite upon such an occasion having no children of my own who should i look to in any little matter i may ever have to bestow but the children of my sisters and i am sure mr norris is too just but you know i am a woman of few words and professions do not let us be frightened from a good deed by a trifle give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world and ten to one but she has the means of settling well without farther expense to anybody a niece of ours sir thomas i may say or at least of yours would not grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages i don t say she would be so handsome as her cousins i dare say she would not but she would be introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable circumstances as in all human probability would get her a creditable establishment you are thinking of your sons but do not you know that of all things upon earth that is the least likely to happen brought up as they would be always together like brothers and sisters it is morally impossible i never knew an instance of it it is in fact the only sure way of providing against the connexion suppose her a pretty girl and seen by tom or edmund for the first time seven years hence and i dare say there would be mischief the very idea of her having been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and neglect would be enough to make either of the dear sweet tempered boys in love with her but breed her up with them from this time and suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel and she will never be more to either than a sister,1,77.25,67,14.25,11.25,4.25,0.75,2.25,3.25,0.5,3,8,18,10.5,5,7.5,1.75,5.25
p00017_A,00017,A,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends,1,82.56,67.18,18.97,14.36,5.64,0,2.56,4.62,1.03,4.62,4.62,12.82,11.79,7.18,7.18,2.56,5.13

p00452_A,00452,A,and yet in general nothing can be more easily ascertained the distinction is so broad manners as well as appearance are generally speaking so totally different till now i could not have supposed it possible to be mistaken as to a girl s being out or not a girl not out has always the same sort of dress a close bonnet for instance looks very demure and never says a word you may smile but it is so i assure you and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far it is all very proper girls should be quiet and modest the most objectionable part is that the alteration of manners on being introduced into company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite to confidence that is the faulty part of the present system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr bertram i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes,1,81.15,65.45,8.38,4.19,1.57,0,1.57,0.52,0.52,4.19,7.33,14.66,11.52,11.52,9.42,3.14,6.81

p00459_A,00459,A,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me,1,77.38,62.7,16.27,13.1,7.14,0.79,0.79,1.59,2.38,3.17,5.95,14.29,8.73,5.16,9.13,2.38,5.95

p00512_A,00512,A,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it

yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it
