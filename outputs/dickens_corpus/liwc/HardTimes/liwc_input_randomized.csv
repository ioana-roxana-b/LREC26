p00036_A,00036,A,thank you sir i have thought sometimes that perhaps i tried to learn too much and that if i had asked to be allowed to try a little less i might have
p00037_A,00037,A,i wish i could have made a better acknowledgment sir of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you and of your protection of her
p00038_A,00038,A,thank you sir very much

p00041_A,00041,A,we had our fears before yesterday and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last night and heard what passed being close to rachael all the time i went to him when no one saw and said to him he was in a tremble before i whispered to him and he started and trembled more then and said i thought of father s old circus i have not forgotten where mr sleary goes at this time of year and i read of him in a paper only the other day i told him to hurry there and tell his name and ask mr sleary to hide him till i came he said and i saw him shrink away among the people
p00042_A,00042,A,very well then he is a veterinary surgeon a farrier and horsebreaker give me your definition of a horse girl number twenty unable to define a horse girl number twenty possessed of no facts in reference to one of the commonest of animals some boy s definition of a horse bitzer yours bitzer your definition of a horse

p00044_A,00044,A,is it accessible to any compassionate influence

p00046_A,00046,A,if this is solely a question of self interest with you
p00047_A,00047,A,what sum of money will you set against your expected promotion
p00048_A,00048,A,bitzer bitzer i have but one chance left to soften you you were many years at my school if in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son i entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance
p00049_A,00049,A,quadruped graminivorous forty teeth namely twenty four grinders four eye teeth and twelve incisive sheds coat in the spring in marshy countries sheds hoofs too hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron age known by marks in mouth
p00050_A,00050,A,i m sorry to interfere with your plans but i can t allow myself to be done by horse riders i must have young mr tom he mustn t be got away by horse riders here he is in a smock frock and i must have him
p00051_A,00051,A,the circulation sir couldn t be carried on without one no man sir acquainted with the facts established by harvey relating to the circulation of the blood can doubt that i have a heart
p00052_A,00052,A,it is accessible to reason sir and to nothing else
p00053_A,00053,A,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good
p00054_A,00054,A,i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir but i am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self interest what you must always appeal to is a person s self interest it s your only hold we are so constituted i was brought up in that catechism when i was very young sir as you are aware
p00055_A,00055,A,thank you sir for hinting at the proposal but i will not set any sum against it knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative i have gone over the calculations in my mind and i find that to compound a felony even on very high terms indeed would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the bank
p00056_A,00056,A,now girl number twenty you know what a horse is
p00057_A,00057,A,you must paper it whether you like it or not don t tell us you wouldn t paper it what do you mean boy
p00058_A,00058,A,fact fact fact
p00059_A,00059,A,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00060_A,00060,A,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00061_A,00061,A,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00062_A,00062,A,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00063_A,00063,A,cecilia jupe by name
p00064_A,00064,A,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00065_A,00065,A,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00066_A,00066,A,i am much of your opinion
p00067_A,00067,A,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00068_A,00068,A,now girl take this gentleman and me to your father s we are going there what have you got in that bottle you are carrying
p00069_A,00069,A,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00070_A,00070,A,has what has he missed
p00071_A,00071,A,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00072_A,00072,A,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00073_A,00073,A,can jupe be sent here bounderby
p00074_A,00074,A,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00075_A,00075,A,hush that is enough never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more bounderby this is a case for rigid training and i shall observe it with interest
p00076_A,00076,A,you have missed my letter
p00077_A,00077,A,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p00078_A,00078,A,indeed
p00079_A,00079,A,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p00080_A,00080,A,undoubtedly she is here
p00081_A,00081,A,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p00082_A,00082,A,my dear bounderby
p00083_A,00083,A,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p00084_A,00084,A,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p00085_A,00085,A,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p00086_A,00086,A,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p00087_A,00087,A,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p00088_A,00088,A,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p00089_A,00089,A,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p00090_A,00090,A,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p00091_A,00091,A,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p00092_A,00092,A,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p00093_A,00093,A,bounderby this is unreasonable
p00094_A,00094,A,not i fear to spare me
p00095_A,00095,A,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p00096_A,00096,A,what do i mean bounderby
p00097_A,00097,A,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p00098_A,00098,A,if you put it in those terms
p00099_A,00099,A,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p00100_A,00100,A,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p00101_A,00101,A,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p00102_A,00102,A,of course no why wouldn t you you must paper it
p00103_A,00103,A,ay ay ay but you mustn t fancy that s it you are never to fancy
p00104_A,00104,A,fact fact fact
p00105_A,00105,A,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure
p00106_A,00106,A,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00107_A,00107,A,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00108_A,00108,A,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00109_A,00109,A,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00110_A,00110,A,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00111_A,00111,A,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00112_A,00112,A,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00113_A,00113,A,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00114_A,00114,A,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week
p00115_A,00115,A,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00116_A,00116,A,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00117_A,00117,A,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00118_A,00118,A,now tom gradgrind here s a lady here mrs sparsit you know mrs sparsit who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb
p00119_A,00119,A,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p00120_A,00120,A,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse
p00121_A,00121,A,ah indeed and in that conversation
p00122_A,00122,A,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p00123_A,00123,A,here
p00124_A,00124,A,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone
p00125_A,00125,A,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p00126_A,00126,A,i thought you couldn t make em
p00127_A,00127,A,i never mentioned his name
p00128_A,00128,A,who do you mean by we
p00129_A,00129,A,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p00130_A,00130,A,i don t see it at all sir
p00131_A,00131,A,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p00132_A,00132,A,you d like to keep her here for a time
p00133_A,00133,A,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p00134_A,00134,A,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p00135_A,00135,A,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p00136_A,00136,A,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p00137_A,00137,A,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p00138_A,00138,A,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p00139_A,00139,A,by your visiting proposition
p00140_A,00140,A,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p00141_A,00141,A,what made you think of this
p00142_A,00142,A,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p00143_A,00143,A,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p00144_A,00144,A,yes sir no sir
p00145_A,00145,A,and is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them and have people walking over them with heavy boots
p00146_A,00146,A,gin
p00147_A,00147,A,the what
p00148_A,00148,A,then what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for
p00149_A,00149,A,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00150_A,00150,A,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p00151_A,00151,A,it wouldn t hurt them sir they wouldn t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy
p00152_A,00152,A,dear no sir it s the nine oils
p00153_A,00153,A,the nine oils sir to rub father with
p00154_A,00154,A,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00155_A,00155,A,this is it sir and if you wouldn t mind sir this is the house it s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it s only merrylegs and he only barks
p00156_A,00156,A,o my dear father my good kind father where are you gone you are gone to try to do me some good i know you are gone away for my sake i am sure and how miserable and helpless you will be without me poor poor father until you come back
p00157_A,00157,A,louisa thomas in the name of wonder idleness and folly what do you do here
p00158_A,00158,A,what it was like
p00159_A,00159,A,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00160_A,00160,A,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00161_A,00161,A,tired of what
p00162_A,00162,A,my dear louisa you are a woman
p00163_A,00163,A,my dear i must speak with you alone and seriously come to me in my room after breakfast to morrow will you
p00164_A,00164,A,your hands are rather cold louisa are you not well
p00165_A,00165,A,and cheerful
p00166_A,00166,A,my dear louisa i prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together you have been so well trained and you do i am happy to say so much justice to the education you have received that i have perfect confidence in your good sense you are not impulsive you are not romantic you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation from that ground alone i know you will view and consider what i am going to communicate louisa my dear you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me a proposal of marriage my dear
p00167_A,00167,A,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00168_A,00168,A,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00169_A,00169,A,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00170_A,00170,A,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00171_A,00171,A,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00172_A,00172,A,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00173_A,00173,A,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00174_A,00174,A,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00175_A,00175,A,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00176_A,00176,A,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00177_A,00177,A,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00178_A,00178,A,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00179_A,00179,A,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00180_A,00180,A,how matter what matter my dear
p00181_A,00181,A,certainly my dear
p00182_A,00182,A,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00183_A,00183,A,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00184_A,00184,A,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00185_A,00185,A,my dear quite true quite true
p00186_A,00186,A,louisa
p00187_A,00187,A,what is the matter how strange you look and good heaven have you come here exposed to this storm
p00188_A,00188,A,what is it i conjure you louisa tell me what is the matter
p00189_A,00189,A,yes louisa
p00190_A,00190,A,curse the hour curse the hour
p00191_A,00191,A,yes louisa
p00192_A,00192,A,no no my poor child
p00193_A,00193,A,o no no no louisa
p00194_A,00194,A,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00195_A,00195,A,and you so young louisa
p00196_A,00196,A,louisa
p00197_A,00197,A,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00198_A,00198,A,for you louisa
p00199_A,00199,A,my dear louisa my poor daughter my unfortunate child it would be hopeless for me louisa to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed i have been and still am by what broke upon me last night the ground on which i stand has ceased to be solid under my feet the only support on which i leaned and the strength of which it seemed and still does seem impossible to question has given way in an instant i am stunned by these discoveries i have no selfish meaning in what i say but i find the shock of what broke upon me last night to be very heavy indeed i will not say louisa that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago it would have been better for us both better for your peace and better for mine for i am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind i had proved my my system to myself and i have rigidly administered it and i must bear the responsibility of its failures i only entreat you to believe my favourite child that i have meant to do right
p00200_A,00200,A,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00201_A,00201,A,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p00202_A,00202,A,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p00203_A,00203,A,not now my dears in the evening i am not able yet to morrow
p00204_A,00204,A,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p00205_A,00205,A,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p00206_A,00206,A,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p00207_A,00207,A,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p00208_A,00208,A,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p00209_A,00209,A,wanted to see what it was like
p00210_A,00210,A,yes father
p00211_A,00211,A,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00212_A,00212,A,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00213_A,00213,A,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00214_A,00214,A,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00215_A,00215,A,yes father
p00216_A,00216,A,yes father
p00217_A,00217,A,quite well father
p00218_A,00218,A,i am as cheerful father as i usually am or usually have been
p00219_A,00219,A,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00220_A,00220,A,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00221_A,00221,A,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00222_A,00222,A,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00223_A,00223,A,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00224_A,00224,A,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00225_A,00225,A,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00226_A,00226,A,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00227_A,00227,A,shall i marry him
p00228_A,00228,A,no father i do not
p00229_A,00229,A,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00230_A,00230,A,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00231_A,00231,A,i speak of my own life father
p00232_A,00232,A,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00233_A,00233,A,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00234_A,00234,A,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00235_A,00235,A,none father what does it matter
p00236_A,00236,A,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00237_A,00237,A,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00238_A,00238,A,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00239_A,00239,A,father i want to speak to you
p00240_A,00240,A,yes
p00241_A,00241,A,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00242_A,00242,A,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00243_A,00243,A,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00244_A,00244,A,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00245_A,00245,A,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00246_A,00246,A,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00247_A,00247,A,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00248_A,00248,A,and i so young in this condition father for i show you now without fear or favour the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know it you proposed my husband to me i took him i never made a pretence to him or you that i loved him i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom i made that wild escape into something visionary and have slowly found out how wild it was but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him it matters little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors when i was irrevocably married there rose up into rebellion against the tie the old strife made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me father until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul
p00249_A,00249,A,i do not reproach you father i make no complaint i am here with another object
p00250_A,00250,A,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00251_A,00251,A,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00252_A,00252,A,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00253_A,00253,A,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p00254_A,00254,A,very honest
p00255_A,00255,A,i believe father he will not come back to town to night
p00256_A,00256,A,dear father you have three young children left they will be different i will be different yet with heaven s help
p00257_A,00257,A,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p00258_A,00258,A,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p00259_A,00259,A,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p00260_A,00260,A,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p00261_A,00261,A,sissy has effected it father
p00262_A,00262,A,i hadn t a shoe to my foot as to a stocking i didn t know such a thing by name i passed the day in a ditch and the night in a pigsty that s the way i spent my tenth birthday not that a ditch was new to me for i was born in a ditch
p00263_A,00263,A,enough to give a baby cold
p00264_A,00264,A,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00265_A,00265,A,well what s the matter what is young thomas in the dumps about
p00266_A,00266,A,it s all right now louisa it s all right young thomas you won t do so any more i ll answer for it s being all over with father well louisa that s worth a kiss isn t it
p00267_A,00267,A,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00268_A,00268,A,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00269_A,00269,A,you may set your mind at rest ma am you can take it very quietly can t you loo
p00270_A,00270,A,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time
p00271_A,00271,A,offence do you suppose if there was any offence given me i shouldn t name it and request to have it corrected i am a straightforward man i believe i don t go beating about for side winds
p00272_A,00272,A,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00273_A,00273,A,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00274_A,00274,A,mrs gradgrind allow me to present to you mrs bounderby
p00275_A,00275,A,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00276_A,00276,A,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00277_A,00277,A,then i beg of you louisa to do nothing of that description for goodness sake you inconsiderate girl or i shall never hear the last of it from your father and thomas it is really shameful with my poor head continually wearing me out that a boy brought up as you have been and whose education has cost what yours has should be found encouraging his sister to wonder when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it louisa don t tell me in my state of health for unless you had been encouraged it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it
p00278_A,00278,A,thank you sir the same to you and happiness also
p00279_A,00279,A,well my dear and i hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself it was all your father s doing he set his heart upon it and he ought to know
p00280_A,00280,A,you want to hear of me my dear that s something new i am sure when anybody wants to hear of me not at all well louisa very faint and giddy
p00281_A,00281,A,i think there s a pain somewhere in the room but i couldn t positively say that i have got it you very seldom see your sister she grows like you i wish you would look at her sissy bring her here do you see the likeness louisa
p00282_A,00282,A,eh yes i always say so and that reminds me i i want to speak to you my dear sissy my good girl leave us alone a minute
p00283_A,00283,A,eh yes to be sure my dear you know your father is almost always away now and therefore i must write to him about it
p00284_A,00284,A,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything
p00285_A,00285,A,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00286_A,00286,A,that s the reason
p00287_A,00287,A,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00288_A,00288,A,i want to hear of you mother not of myself
p00289_A,00289,A,are you in pain dear mother
p00290_A,00290,A,yes mother i should think her like me but
p00291_A,00291,A,you were going to speak to me mother
p00292_A,00292,A,about what mother don t be troubled about what
p00293_A,00293,A,i can hear you mother
p00294_A,00294,A,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00295_A,00295,A,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly

p00344_A,00344,A,i don t know i don t see why he shouldn t be
p00345_A,00345,A,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is
p00346_A,00346,A,no he took it pretty well he was civil enough where are you loo good night my dear good night

p00351_A,00351,A,he frightened me so with his cruel faces
p00352_A,00352,A,no i wasn t sir not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say it s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn t known to the horse riders
p00353_A,00353,A,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00354_A,00354,A,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00355_A,00355,A,by your leaves gentlemen
p00356_A,00356,A,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00357_A,00357,A,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00358_A,00358,A,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00359_A,00359,A,by your leaves gentlemen it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe
p00360_A,00360,A,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00361_A,00361,A,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00362_A,00362,A,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00363_A,00363,A,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00364_A,00364,A,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00365_A,00365,A,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00366_A,00366,A,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00367_A,00367,A,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00368_A,00368,A,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00369_A,00369,A,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00370_A,00370,A,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00371_A,00371,A,a cackler here we go again
p00372_A,00372,A,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00373_A,00373,A,perhaps so
p00374_A,00374,A,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00375_A,00375,A,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00376_A,00376,A,kidderminster stow that
p00377_A,00377,A,missed his tip
p00378_A,00378,A,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00379_A,00379,A,oh that is tip is it
p00380_A,00380,A,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00381_A,00381,A,yes i was
p00382_A,00382,A,i never saw the man in my life
p00383_A,00383,A,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00384_A,00384,A,why has he been so very much goosed
p00385_A,00385,A,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00386_A,00386,A,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00387_A,00387,A,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00388_A,00388,A,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00389_A,00389,A,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00390_A,00390,A,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now

p00435_A,00435,A,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00436_A,00436,A,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00437_A,00437,A,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00438_A,00438,A,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00439_A,00439,A,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00440_A,00440,A,i do not sir deny it
p00441_A,00441,A,it is true sir
p00442_A,00442,A,i can go mr bounderby if you wish it
p00443_A,00443,A,sir i hope i never had nowt to say not fitten for a born lady to year sin i were born mysen
p00444_A,00444,A,was it an unequal marriage sir in point of years
p00445_A,00445,A,indeed sir i inferred from its being so miserable a marriage that it was probably an unequal one in point of years
p00446_A,00446,A,good evening mr bounderby
p00447_A,00447,A,thank you sir
p00448_A,00448,A,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00449_A,00449,A,yes sir
p00450_A,00450,A,yes sir i hope you may be happy mr bounderby oh indeed i hope you may be happy sir
p00451_A,00451,A,i wish with all my heart sir that you may be in all respects very happy
p00452_A,00452,A,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00453_A,00453,A,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00454_A,00454,A,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00455_A,00455,A,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00456_A,00456,A,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00457_A,00457,A,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00458_A,00458,A,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00459_A,00459,A,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00460_A,00460,A,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00461_A,00461,A,don t be low sir pray let me see you cheerful sir as i used to do i cannot bear to see you so sir try a hand at backgammon sir as you used to do when i had the honour of living under your roof
p00462_A,00462,A,no sir i am aware that you have not i remember that miss gradgrind takes no interest in the game but i shall be happy sir if you will condescend
p00463_A,00463,A,oh dear no sir i was thinking of the dew
p00464_A,00464,A,it s not myself sir i am fearful of miss gradgrind s taking cold
p00465_A,00465,A,really sir oh sir not your sherry warm with lemon peel and nutmeg
p00466_A,00466,A,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00467_A,00467,A,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00468_A,00468,A,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00469_A,00469,A,very true sir
p00470_A,00470,A,no indeed sir
p00471_A,00471,A,ah
p00472_A,00472,A,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00473_A,00473,A,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00474_A,00474,A,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00475_A,00475,A,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again
p00476_A,00476,A,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00477_A,00477,A,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p00478_A,00478,A,sir
p00479_A,00479,A,pray sir do not bite my nose off
p00480_A,00480,A,mr bounderby sir
p00481_A,00481,A,may i ask sir have you been ruffled this morning
p00482_A,00482,A,may i inquire sir whether i am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper
p00483_A,00483,A,it is apparent to me that i am in your way at present i will retire to my own apartment sir
p00484_A,00484,A,thank you sir i can do it for myself
p00485_A,00485,A,really sir
p00486_A,00486,A,oh pray sir don t disparage your judgment everybody knows how unerring mr bounderby s judgment is everybody has had proofs of it it must be the theme of general conversation disparage anything in yourself but your judgment sir
p00487_A,00487,A,it never occurred to me before sir but now you mention it should think it highly probable
p00488_A,00488,A,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl
p00489_A,00489,A,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00490_A,00490,A,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00491_A,00491,A,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00492_A,00492,A,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00493_A,00493,A,louisa louisa louisa
p00494_A,00494,A,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00495_A,00495,A,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00496_A,00496,A,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00497_A,00497,A,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00498_A,00498,A,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00499_A,00499,A,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00500_A,00500,A,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00501_A,00501,A,very well you re a steady hand and i was not mistaken now let me hear what it s all about as it s not that let me hear what it is what have you got to say out with it lad
p00502_A,00502,A,i was acquainted with all this you know except the last clause long ago it s a bad job that s what it is you had better have been satisfied as you were and not have got married however it s too late to say that
p00503_A,00503,A,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00504_A,00504,A,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00505_A,00505,A,mrs sparsit ma am i am going to astonish you
p00506_A,00506,A,i am going ma am to marry tom gradgrind s daughter
p00507_A,00507,A,well ma am i am obliged to you i hope i shall be
p00508_A,00508,A,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00509_A,00509,A,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00510_A,00510,A,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00511_A,00511,A,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00512_A,00512,A,you ll have your own private apartments and you ll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it and you ll have your maid to attend upon you and you ll have your light porter to protect you and you ll be what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable
p00513_A,00513,A,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit
p00514_A,00514,A,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00515_A,00515,A,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00516_A,00516,A,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00517_A,00517,A,i haven t played backgammon ma am since that time
p00518_A,00518,A,what s the matter ma am you don t see a fire do you
p00519_A,00519,A,what have you got to do with the dew ma am
p00520_A,00520,A,she never takes cold
p00521_A,00521,A,why i have got out of the habit of taking it now ma am
p00522_A,00522,A,there stop where you are ma am stop where you are mrs bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble i believe
p00523_A,00523,A,i tell you what ma am you shall come down here of a saturday while the fine weather lasts and stay till monday
p00524_A,00524,A,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am
p00525_A,00525,A,nor yet in a week ma am
p00526_A,00526,A,in a similar manner ma am i can wait you know if romulus and remus could wait josiah bounderby can wait they were better off in their youth than i was however they had a she wolf for a nurse i had only a she wolf for a grandmother she didn t give any milk ma am she gave bruises she was a regular alderney at that
p00527_A,00527,A,no ma am i have not heard anything more about it it s in hand though and young tom who rather sticks to business at present something new for him he hadn t the schooling i had is helping my injunction is keep it quiet and let it seem to blow over do what you like under the rose but don t give a sign of what you re about or half a hundred of em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted out of reach for good keep it quiet and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little and we shall have em
p00528_A,00528,A,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00529_A,00529,A,but you ll go down to morrow ma am all the same you ll go down just as if i was there it will make no difference to you
p00530_A,00530,A,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00531_A,00531,A,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00532_A,00532,A,what do you mean ma am
p00533_A,00533,A,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p00534_A,00534,A,why what s the matter now mrs sparsit ma am
p00535_A,00535,A,why what do you mean by this i ask you what do you mean by this mrs sparsit ma am
p00536_A,00536,A,what s the matter now ma am
p00537_A,00537,A,bite your nose off ma am your nose
p00538_A,00538,A,well ma am what are you staring at
p00539_A,00539,A,yes ma am
p00540_A,00540,A,now i ll tell you what ma am i am not come here to be bullied a female may be highly connected but she can t be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position and i am not going to put up with it
p00541_A,00541,A,allow me to open the door ma am
p00542_A,00542,A,you had better allow me ma am
p00543_A,00543,A,i have been thinking it over you see since the late affairs have happened ma am
p00544_A,00544,A,it appears to me ma am i say that a different sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of your powers such an establishment as your relation lady scadgers s now don t you think you might find some affairs there ma am to interfere with
p00545_A,00545,A,then suppose you try ma am you can take your own time for going ma am but perhaps in the meanwhile it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind to eat her meals by herself and not to be intruded upon i really ought to apologise to you being only josiah bounderby of coketown for having stood in your light so long because i can take the opportunity of saying a word to you before you go mrs sparsit ma am i rather think you are cramped here do you know it appears to me that under my humble roof there s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people s affairs and it appears to my poor judgment
p00546_A,00546,A,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00547_A,00547,A,louisa never wonder
p00548_A,00548,A,how was this done
p00549_A,00549,A,this robbery i forced the safe myself over night and shut it up ajar before i went away i had had the key that was found made long before i dropped it that morning that it might be supposed to have been used i didn t take the money all at once i pretended to put my balance away every night but i didn t now you know all about it if a thunderbolt had fallen on me it would have shocked me less than this
p00550_A,00550,A,you must be got to liverpool and sent abroad
p00551_A,00551,A,here is your letter all necessary means will be provided for you atone by repentance and better conduct for the shocking action you have committed and the dreadful consequences to which it has led give me your hand my poor boy and may god forgive you as i do
p00552_A,00552,A,you don t hate sissy tom
p00553_A,00553,A,no she does not tom i am sure
p00554_A,00554,A,not me i hope tom
p00555_A,00555,A,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00556_A,00556,A,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00557_A,00557,A,it s a great pity it s a great pity tom it s very unfortunate for both of us
p00558_A,00558,A,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it
p00559_A,00559,A,your revenge tom
p00560_A,00560,A,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00561_A,00561,A,what is your great mode of smoothing and managing tom is it a secret
p00562_A,00562,A,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00563_A,00563,A,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00564_A,00564,A,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00565_A,00565,A,yes tom
p00566_A,00566,A,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00567_A,00567,A,i am asking sissy a few questions tom you have no occasion to go away but don t interrupt us for a moment tom dear
p00568_A,00568,A,i ll come directly
p00569_A,00569,A,dear tom how long it is since you have been to see me
p00570_A,00570,A,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00571_A,00571,A,no
p00572_A,00572,A,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00573_A,00573,A,no dear tom i won t forget
p00574_A,00574,A,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00575_A,00575,A,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00576_A,00576,A,tom have you anything to tell me if ever you loved me in your life and have anything concealed from every one besides tell it to me
p00577_A,00577,A,my dear brother is there nothing that you have to tell me is there nothing you can tell me if you will you can tell me nothing that will change me o tom tell me the truth
p00578_A,00578,A,as you lie here alone my dear in the melancholy night so you must lie somewhere one night when even i if i am living then shall have left you as i am here beside you barefoot unclothed undistinguishable in darkness so must i lie through all the night of my decay until i am dust in the name of that time tom tell me the truth now
p00579_A,00579,A,you may be certain that i will not reproach you you may be certain that i will be compassionate and true to you you may be certain that i will save you at whatever cost o tom have you nothing to tell me whisper very softly say only and i shall understand you not a word tom
p00580_A,00580,A,you are tired
p00581_A,00581,A,you have been so hurried and disturbed to day have any fresh discoveries been made
p00582_A,00582,A,tom have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people and that we saw those three together
p00583_A,00583,A,yes but i did not know then what was going to happen
p00584_A,00584,A,ought i to say after what has happened that i made that visit should i say so must i say so
p00585_A,00585,A,tom do you believe the man i gave the money to is really implicated in this crime
p00586_A,00586,A,he seemed to me an honest man
p00587_A,00587,A,was he offended by what you said
p00588_A,00588,A,you have nothing more to tell me
p00589_A,00589,A,i wouldn t have you do that to night tom of all the nights in your life many and much happier as i hope they will be
p00590_A,00590,A,o tom tom do we end so after all my love
p00591_A,00591,A,what is the first principle of this science
p00592_A,00592,A,it would be a fine thing to be you miss louisa
p00593_A,00593,A,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00594_A,00594,A,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00595_A,00595,A,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00596_A,00596,A,o no they know everything
p00597_A,00597,A,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00598_A,00598,A,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00599_A,00599,A,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00600_A,00600,A,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00601_A,00601,A,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00602_A,00602,A,then mr m choakumchild said he would try me once more and he said here are the stutterings
p00603_A,00603,A,yes miss louisa they always remind me of stutterings and that s another of my mistakes of accidents upon the sea and i find mr m choakumchild said that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death what is the percentage and i said miss i said it was nothing
p00604_A,00604,A,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00605_A,00605,A,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00606_A,00606,A,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00607_A,00607,A,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00608_A,00608,A,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00609_A,00609,A,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00610_A,00610,A,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00611_A,00611,A,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00612_A,00612,A,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00613_A,00613,A,always always kinder and kinder than i can tell he was angry only one night and that was not to me but merrylegs merrylegs is his performing dog
p00614_A,00614,A,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00615_A,00615,A,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and
p00616_A,00616,A,i hope i have not disturbed you i have come to ask if you would let me stay with you
p00617_A,00617,A,am i i would be something to you if i might

p00619_A,00619,A,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00620_A,00620,A,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00621_A,00621,A,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try

p00656_A,00656,A,i am so unhappy and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste that if i had been bereft of sense to this hour and instead of being as learned as you think me had to begin to acquire the simplest truths i could not want a guide to peace contentment honour all the good of which i am quite devoid more abjectly than i do does not that repel you
p00657_A,00657,A,forgive me pity me help me have compassion on my great need and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart

p00663_A,00663,A,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone
p00664_A,00664,A,there s no more to tell miss louisa i keep the nine oils ready for him and i know he will come back every letter that i see in mr gradgrind s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes for i think it comes from father or from mr sleary about father mr sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of and i trust to him to keep his word

p00724_A,00724,A,now stephen what s the matter with you now you know we have never had any difficulty with you and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones you don t expect to be set up in a coach and six and to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon as a good many of em do and therefore i know already that you have not come here to make a complaint now you know i am certain of that beforehand
p00725_A,00725,A,very well fire away
p00726_A,00726,A,i have heard all this before she took to drinking left off working sold the furniture pawned the clothes and played old gooseberry
p00727_A,00727,A,the more fool you i think
p00728_A,00728,A,you hear what this lady asks was it an unequal marriage in point of years this unlucky job of yours
p00729_A,00729,A,well why don t you go on
p00730_A,00730,A,what do you mean what are you talking about you took her for better for worse
p00731_A,00731,A,no how
p00732_A,00732,A,of course there is
p00733_A,00733,A,of course there is
p00734_A,00734,A,of course there is
p00735_A,00735,A,of course there is
p00736_A,00736,A,hem there s a sanctity in this relation of life and and it must be kept up
p00737_A,00737,A,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money
p00738_A,00738,A,why you d have to go to doctors commons with a suit and you d have to go to a court of common law with a suit and you d have to go to the house of lords with a suit and you d have to get an act of parliament to enable you to marry again and it would cost you if it was a case of very plain sailing i suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound perhaps twice the money
p00739_A,00739,A,certainly not
p00740_A,00740,A,pooh pooh don t you talk nonsense my good fellow about things you don t understand and don t you call the institutions of your country a muddle or you ll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings the institutions of your country are not your piece work and the only thing you have got to do is to mind your piece work you didn t take your wife for fast and for loose but for better for worse if she has turned out worse why all we have got to say is she might have turned out better
p00741_A,00741,A,now i ll tell you what with what i shall call your unhallowed opinions you have been quite shocking this lady who as i have already told you is a born lady and who as i have not already told you has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds tens of thousands of pounds now you have always been a steady hand hitherto but my opinion is and so i tell you plainly that you are turning into the wrong road you have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other they re always about and the best thing you can do is to come out of that now you know i can see as far into a grindstone as another man farther than a good many perhaps because i had my nose well kept to it when i was young i see traces of the turtle soup and venison and gold spoon in this yes i do by the lord harry i do
p00742_A,00742,A,now speak up
p00743_A,00743,A,why i have told you speak up like a man since you are a man and tell us about yourself and this combination
p00744_A,00744,A,now look here harthouse here s a specimen of em when this man was here once before i warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about and who ought to be hanged wherever they are found and i told this man that he was going in the wrong direction now would you believe it that although they have put this mark upon him he is such a slave to them still that he s afraid to open his lips about them
p00745_A,00745,A,you said ah i know what you said more than that i know what you mean you see not always the same thing by the lord harry quite different things you had better tell us at once that that fellow slackbridge is not in the town stirring up the people to mutiny and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people that is a most confounded scoundrel you had better tell us so at once you can t deceive me you want to tell us so why don t you
p00746_A,00746,A,now you ll think this pretty well harthouse you ll think this tolerably strong you ll say upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with but this is nothing sir you shall hear me ask this man a question pray mr blackpool may i take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this combination
p00747_A,00747,A,ah how it happens
p00748_A,00748,A,not to me you know
p00749_A,00749,A,as for me any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it if only josiah bounderby of coketown had been in question you would have joined and made no bones about it
p00750_A,00750,A,though he knows that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for now mr harthouse you have been knocking about in the world some time did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country
p00751_A,00751,A,in short it s because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift go through with it while you are about it out with it
p00752_A,00752,A,now my friend if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute i should like to have a word or two with you you said just now that you had nothing to tell us about this business you are quite sure of that before we go any further
p00753_A,00753,A,here s a gentleman from london present a parliament gentleman i should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me instead of taking the substance of it for i know precious well beforehand what it will be nobody knows better than i do take notice instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth now what do you complain of
p00754_A,00754,A,what do you people in a general way complain of
p00755_A,00755,A,of course now perhaps you ll let the gentleman know how you would set this muddle as you re so fond of calling it to rights
p00756_A,00756,A,i ll tell you something towards it at any rate we will make an example of half a dozen slackbridges we ll indict the blackguards for felony and get em shipped off to penal settlements don t tell me we won t man because we will i tell you
p00757_A,00757,A,just stop a moment i told you the last time you were here with a grievance that you had better turn about and come out of that and i also told you if you remember that i was up to the gold spoon look out
p00758_A,00758,A,now it s clear to me that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance and you go about sowing it and raising crops that s the business of your life my friend you are such a waspish raspish ill conditioned chap you see that even your own union the men who know you best will have nothing to do with you i never thought those fellows could be right in anything but i tell you what i so far go along with them for a novelty that i ll have nothing to do with you either you can finish off what you re at and then go elsewhere
p00759_A,00759,A,what i know i know and what you know you know i have no more to say about it

p00799_A,00799,A,what are the restless wretches doing now
p00800_A,00800,A,it is much to be regretted that the united masters allow of any such class combinations
p00801_A,00801,A,being united themselves they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man
p00802_A,00802,A,i do not pretend to understand these things my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere and mr sparsit as a powler being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions i only know that these people must be conquered and that it s high time it was done once for all
p00803_A,00803,A,has it been a busy day bitzer
p00804_A,00804,A,the clerks are trustworthy punctual and industrious of course
p00805_A,00805,A,ah h
p00806_A,00806,A,bitzer do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names
p00807_A,00807,A,please to remember that i have a charge here i hold a trust here bitzer under mr bounderby however improbable both mr bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago that he would ever become my patron making me an annual compliment i cannot but regard him in that light from mr bounderby i have received every acknowledgment of my social station and every recognition of my family descent that i could possibly expect more far more therefore to my patron i will be scrupulously true and i do not consider i will not consider i cannot consider that i should be scrupulously true if i allowed names to be mentioned under this roof that are unfortunately most unfortunately no doubt of that connected with his no bitzer say an individual and i will hear you say mr thomas and you must excuse me
p00808_A,00808,A,ah h
p00809_A,00809,A,ah h

p00816_A,00816,A,nothing just now bitzer
p00817_A,00817,A,i don t know who it can be
p00818_A,00818,A,what a stranger can want at the bank at this time of the evening unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late i don t know but i hold a charge in this establishment from mr bounderby and i will never shrink from it if to see him is any part of the duty i have accepted i will see him use your own discretion bitzer
p00819_A,00819,A,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00820_A,00820,A,it must be admitted that it s very tasteful
p00821_A,00821,A,it s immoral to game
p00822_A,00822,A,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00823_A,00823,A,thank you ma am
p00824_A,00824,A,all is shut up ma am
p00825_A,00825,A,well ma am i can t say that i have heard anything particular our people are a bad lot ma am but that is no news unfortunately
p00826_A,00826,A,merely going on in the old way ma am uniting and leaguing and engaging to stand by one another
p00827_A,00827,A,yes ma am

p00833_A,00833,A,i beg your pardon ma am it s quite true that you did object to names being used and they re always best avoided
p00834_A,00834,A,with the usual exception ma am of an individual
p00835_A,00835,A,an individual ma am has never been what he ought to have been since he first came into the place he is a dissipated extravagant idler he is not worth his salt ma am he wouldn t get it either if he hadn t a friend and relation at court ma am
p00836_A,00836,A,i only hope ma am that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on otherwise ma am we know out of whose pocket that money comes
p00837_A,00837,A,he is to be pitied ma am the last party i have alluded to is to be pitied ma am
p00838_A,00838,A,as to an individual ma am he is as improvident as any of the people in this town and you know what their improvidence is ma am no one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does
p00839_A,00839,A,thank you ma am but since you do refer to me now look at me ma am i have put by a little ma am already that gratuity which i receive at christmas ma am i never touch it i don t even go the length of my wages though they re not high ma am why can t they do as i have done ma am what one person can do another can do as to their wanting recreations ma am it s stuff and nonsense i don t want recreations i never did and i never shall i don t like em as to their combining together there are many of them i have no doubt that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then whether in money or good will and improve their livelihood then why don t they improve it ma am it s the first consideration of a rational creature and it s what they pretend to want
p00840_A,00840,A,i am sure we are constantly hearing ma am till it becomes quite nauseous concerning their wives and families why look at me ma am i don t want a wife and family why should they
p00841_A,00841,A,yes ma am that s where it is if they were more provident and less perverse ma am what would they do they would say or as the case might be ma am
p00842_A,00842,A,thank you ma am would you wish a little more hot water ma am or is there anything else that i could fetch you
p00843_A,00843,A,thank you ma am i shouldn t wish to disturb you at your meals ma am particularly tea knowing your partiality for it but there s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so ma am and he has come across as if he was going to knock that is his knock ma am no doubt yes ma am would you wish the gentleman to be shown in ma am
p00844_A,00844,A,a stranger ma am evidently
p00845_A,00845,A,if you please ma am the gentleman would wish to see you
p00846_A,00846,A,spends a deal of money on his dress ma am
p00847_A,00847,A,yes ma am if that s worth the money besides which ma am he looks to me as if he gamed
p00848_A,00848,A,it s ridiculous ma am because the chances are against the players
p00849_A,00849,A,i believe sir you wished to see me
p00850_A,00850,A,please to be seated sir
p00851_A,00851,A,in general much blacker
p00852_A,00852,A,no sir it was once my good or ill fortune as it may be before i became a widow to move in a very different sphere my husband was a powler
p00853_A,00853,A,a powler
p00854_A,00854,A,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00855_A,00855,A,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00856_A,00856,A,no sir he does not
p00857_A,00857,A,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00858_A,00858,A,yes he had that honour
p00859_A,00859,A,indeed sir is she
p00860_A,00860,A,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00861_A,00861,A,i have already had the honour
p00862_A,00862,A,it appears but yesterday sir that i had the honour of receiving you at the bank when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with mr bounderby s address
p00863_A,00863,A,we live in a singular world sir
p00864_A,00864,A,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00865_A,00865,A,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00866_A,00866,A,very engaging sir
p00867_A,00867,A,i beg your pardon pray excuse me
p00868_A,00868,A,thank you allow me i left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the van and strolled on looking about me exceedingly odd place will you allow me to ask you if it s always as black as this
p00869_A,00869,A,is it possible excuse me you are not a native i think
p00870_A,00870,A,beg your pardon really was
p00871_A,00871,A,powler family you must be very much bored here
p00872_A,00872,A,very philosophical and very exemplary and laudable and
p00873_A,00873,A,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00874_A,00874,A,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00875_A,00875,A,quite an eternity i think he married gradgrind s daughter
p00876_A,00876,A,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00877_A,00877,A,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00878_A,00878,A,i give you my honour mrs powler that i never was so astonished in my life i assure you mrs powler that the father s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity i am obliged to you of all things for correcting so absurd a mistake pray excuse my intrusion many thanks good day
p00879_A,00879,A,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00880_A,00880,A,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00881_A,00881,A,i have had the honour by a coincidence of which i am proud to have made a remark similar in effect though not so epigrammatically expressed
p00882_A,00882,A,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00883_A,00883,A,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00884_A,00884,A,highly so
p00885_A,00885,A,if you want to bring in for any place a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech look after my brother jem for he s your man
p00886_A,00886,A,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00887_A,00887,A,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00888_A,00888,A,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00889_A,00889,A,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00890_A,00890,A,well stephen what s this i hear what have these pests of the earth been doing to you come in and speak up this is the man i was telling you about harthouse
p00891_A,00891,A,harthouse you have a couple of horses down here bring half a dozen more if you like and we ll find room for em there s stabling in this place for a dozen horses and unless nickits is belied he kept the full number a round dozen of em sir when that man was a boy he went to westminster school went to westminster school as a king s scholar when i was principally living on garbage and sleeping in market baskets why if i wanted to keep a dozen horses which i don t for one s enough for me i couldn t bear to see em in their stalls here and think what my own lodging used to be i couldn t look at em sir and not order em out yet so things come round you see this place you know what sort of a place it is you are aware that there s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere i don t care where and here got into the middle of it like a maggot into a nut is josiah bounderby while nickits as a man came into my office and told me yesterday nickits who used to act in latin in the westminster school plays with the chief justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face is drivelling at this minute drivelling sir in a fifth floor up a narrow dark back street in antwerp
p00892_A,00892,A,harthouse have you heard
p00893_A,00893,A,then you haven t heard
p00894_A,00894,A,the bank s robbed
p00895_A,00895,A,robbed last night sir robbed in an extraordinary manner robbed with a false key
p00896_A,00896,A,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00897_A,00897,A,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00898_A,00898,A,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00899_A,00899,A,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00900_A,00900,A,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00901_A,00901,A,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00902_A,00902,A,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00903_A,00903,A,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00904_A,00904,A,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00905_A,00905,A,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00906_A,00906,A,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00907_A,00907,A,oh really
p00908_A,00908,A,why sir i am told that nickits gave seven hundred pound for that seabeach now to be plain with you if i ever in the whole course of my life take seven looks at it at a hundred pound a look it will be as much as i shall do no by george i don t forget that i am josiah bounderby of coketown for years upon years the only pictures in my possession or that i could have got into my possession by any means unless i stole em were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot on the blacking bottles that i was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with and that i sold when they were empty for a farthing a piece and glad to get it
p00909_A,00909,A,heard what
p00910_A,00910,A,i have heard you and so has this brute i have heard nothing else
p00911_A,00911,A,you don t mean it
p00912_A,00912,A,of much
p00913_A,00913,A,of how much
p00914_A,00914,A,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00915_A,00915,A,i suppose it might
p00916_A,00916,A,where is tom by the by
p00917_A,00917,A,is anybody suspected
p00918_A,00918,A,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00919_A,00919,A,suspicious certainly
p00920_A,00920,A,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00921_A,00921,A,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00922_A,00922,A,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00923_A,00923,A,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00924_A,00924,A,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p00925_A,00925,A,pardon me the expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful tom should be so proud of it i know this is inexcusable but i am so compelled to admire
p00926_A,00926,A,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00927_A,00927,A,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00928_A,00928,A,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00929_A,00929,A,thank you i claim to deserve it you know how little i do claim but i will go that length you have done so much for him you are so fond of him your whole life mrs bounderby expresses such charming self forgetfulness on his account pardon me again i am running wide of the subject i am interested in him for his own sake mrs bounderby it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother s years if he is heedless inconsiderate and expensive a little dissipated in the common phrase is he
p00930_A,00930,A,allow me to be frank do you think he games at all i think he makes bets
p00931_A,00931,A,of course he loses
p00932_A,00932,A,everybody does lose who bets may i hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes acquit me of impertinent curiosity my dear mrs bounderby i think tom may be gradually falling into trouble and i wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience shall i say again for his sake is that necessary candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father
p00933_A,00933,A,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00934_A,00934,A,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00935_A,00935,A,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00936_A,00936,A,oh perfectly
p00937_A,00937,A,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00938_A,00938,A,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00939_A,00939,A,nor of any other such person
p00940_A,00940,A,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00941_A,00941,A,my dear child will you not bear with my society for a little while
p00942_A,00942,A,where louisa
p00943_A,00943,A,but we have so little time to make so much of and i have come so far and am altogether so devoted and distracted there never was a slave at once so devoted and ill used by his mistress to look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life and to be received in your frozen manner is heart rending
p00944_A,00944,A,but we must meet my dear louisa where shall we meet shall i ride up to the house a few minutes hence innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me
p00945_A,00945,A,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00946_A,00946,A,you are going to devote yourself as i gather from what mr bounderby has said to the service of your country you have made up your mind to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties
p00947_A,00947,A,have you none of your own
p00948_A,00948,A,you are a singular politician
p00949_A,00949,A,being so impulsive
p00950_A,00950,A,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00951_A,00951,A,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00952_A,00952,A,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00953_A,00953,A,yes
p00954_A,00954,A,i know he does
p00955_A,00955,A,yes
p00956_A,00956,A,i do not think it likely
p00957_A,00957,A,i do not think that likely either
p00958_A,00958,A,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00959_A,00959,A,when i married i found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt heavily for him i mean heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets they were no sacrifice i sold them very willingly i attached no value to them they were quite worthless to me since then i have given my brother at various times what money i could spare in short what money i have had confiding in you at all on the faith of the interest you profess for him i will not do so by halves since you have been in the habit of visiting here he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds i have not been able to give it to him i have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved but i have kept these secrets until now when i trust them to your honour i have held no confidence with any one because you anticipated my reason just now
p00960_A,00960,A,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00961_A,00961,A,you recollect the man mr harthouse
p00962_A,00962,A,his face and his manner and what he said
p00963_A,00963,A,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00964_A,00964,A,no certainly
p00965_A,00965,A,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00966_A,00966,A,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00967_A,00967,A,not here
p00968_A,00968,A,not here
p00969_A,00969,A,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00970_A,00970,A,no
p00971_A,00971,A,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards
p00972_A,00972,A,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p00973_A,00973,A,well then don t begin with me
p00974_A,00974,A,no such luck sir
p00975_A,00975,A,thank ee thank ee well mr harthouse i hope you have had about a dose of old bounderby to night
p00976_A,00976,A,you think so don t you
p00977_A,00977,A,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean
p00978_A,00978,A,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p00979_A,00979,A,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p00980_A,00980,A,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p00981_A,00981,A,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p00982_A,00982,A,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p00983_A,00983,A,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p00984_A,00984,A,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p00985_A,00985,A,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p00986_A,00986,A,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p00987_A,00987,A,his daughter ah and everybody else why he formed me that way
p00988_A,00988,A,he did though i mean to say mr harthouse that when i first left home and went to old bounderby s i was as flat as a warming pan and knew no more about life than any oyster does
p00989_A,00989,A,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p00990_A,00990,A,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p00991_A,00991,A,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no
p00992_A,00992,A,well i must take my leave of you though i say yours is very good tobacco but it s too mild
p00993_A,00993,A,halloa i didn t know you were here
p00994_A,00994,A,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p00995_A,00995,A,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p00996_A,00996,A,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it
p00997_A,00997,A,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p00998_A,00998,A,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p00999_A,00999,A,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p01000_A,01000,A,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p01001_A,01001,A,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p01002_A,01002,A,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p01003_A,01003,A,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p01004_A,01004,A,and i take your offer as a great kindness as a great kindness mr harthouse
p01005_A,01005,A,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p01006_A,01006,A,i will be mr harthouse
p01007_A,01007,A,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p01008_A,01008,A,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p01009_A,01009,A,well i don t know she was off somewhere at daybreak this morning she s always full of mystery i hate her so i do that white chap he s always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow
p01010_A,01010,A,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p01011_A,01011,A,detained two of us were detained i was detained looking for you till i lost every train but the mail it would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night and have to walk home through a pond i was obliged to sleep in town after all
p01012_A,01012,A,where why in my own bed at bounderby s
p01013_A,01013,A,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off

p01030_A,01030,A,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister

p01035_A,01035,A,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p01036_A,01036,A,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p01037_A,01037,A,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p01038_A,01038,A,my good fellow so am i

p01086_A,01086,A,what shall i understand that you mean by a bad name
p01087_A,01087,A,then by the prejudices of his own class and by the prejudices of the other he is sacrificed alike are the two so deeply separated in this town that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them he fell into suspicion with his fellow weavers because he had made a promise not to be one of them i think it must have been to you that he made that promise might i ask you why he made it

p01150_A,01150,A,gone to bed sir

p01153_A,01153,A,i speak to mr harthouse
p01154_A,01154,A,if i do not understand and i do not sir what your honour as a gentleman binds you to in other matters i am sure i may rely upon it to keep my visit secret and to keep secret what i am going to say i will rely upon it if you will tell me i may so far trust
p01155_A,01155,A,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now
p01156_A,01156,A,i left her within an hour
p01157_A,01157,A,at her father s
p01158_A,01158,A,she hurried there last night she arrived there in great agitation and was insensible all through the night i live at her father s and was with her you may be sure sir you will never see her again as long as you live
p01159_A,01159,A,i have no charge from her
p01160_A,01160,A,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p01161_A,01161,A,it is still true there is no hope
p01162_A,01162,A,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p01163_A,01163,A,yes
p01164_A,01164,A,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p01165_A,01165,A,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p01166_A,01166,A,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p01167_A,01167,A,my name
p01168_A,01168,A,sissy jupe
p01169_A,01169,A,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p01170_A,01170,A,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p01171_A,01171,A,at
p01172_A,01172,A,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p01173_A,01173,A,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p01174_A,01174,A,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p01175_A,01175,A,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p01176_A,01176,A,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned
p01177_A,01177,A,will you oblige me by confiding it
p01178_A,01178,A,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p01179_A,01179,A,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence
p01180_A,01180,A,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p01181_A,01181,A,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p01182_A,01182,A,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p01183_A,01183,A,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p01184_A,01184,A,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p01185_A,01185,A,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p01186_A,01186,A,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p01187_A,01187,A,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01188_A,01188,A,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01189_A,01189,A,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01190_A,01190,A,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01191_A,01191,A,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p01192_A,01192,A,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01193_A,01193,A,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01194_A,01194,A,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01195_A,01195,A,you need have no fear of that young lady he is sure
p01196_A,01196,A,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01197_A,01197,A,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p01198_A,01198,A,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p01199_A,01199,A,i misdoubt if there is as many as twenty left in all this place who have any trust in the poor dear lad now if it hadn t been mercifully brought about that i was to have you to speak to times are when i think my mind would not have kept right but i get hope and strength through you and you believe that though appearances may rise against him he will be proved clear
p01200_A,01200,A,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01201_A,01201,A,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01202_A,01202,A,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01203_A,01203,A,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01204_A,01204,A,but he is in none of them he has been sought for in all and he s not there
p01205_A,01205,A,he d walk the journey in two days if he was footsore and couldn t walk i sent him in the letter he got the money to ride lest he should have none of his own to spare
p01206_A,01206,A,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01207_A,01207,A,what is the matter
p01208_A,01208,A,o the poor lad the poor lad he has been made away with he is lying murdered here
p01209_A,01209,A,o my good lord he s down there down there
p01210_A,01210,A,no no no
p01211_A,01211,A,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01212_A,01212,A,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01213_A,01213,A,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01214_A,01214,A,that is a dreadful thought
p01215_A,01215,A,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01216_A,01216,A,true
p01217_A,01217,A,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01218_A,01218,A,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go
p01219_A,01219,A,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael
p01220_A,01220,A,i don t know there is a hat lying in the grass
p01221_A,01221,A,is there has the hat any blood upon it rachael i will go on a little by myself
p01222_A,01222,A,rachael dear rachael good rachael for the love of heaven not these dreadful cries think of stephen think of stephen think of stephen rachael stephen may be living you wouldn t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place a moment if you could bring help to him

p00042_B,00042,B,the circulation sir couldn t be carried on without one no man sir acquainted with the facts established by harvey relating to the circulation of the blood can doubt that i have a heart
p00043_B,00043,B,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good
p00044_B,00044,B,i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir but i am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self interest what you must always appeal to is a person s self interest it s your only hold we are so constituted i was brought up in that catechism when i was very young sir as you are aware
p00045_B,00045,B,quadruped graminivorous forty teeth namely twenty four grinders four eye teeth and twelve incisive sheds coat in the spring in marshy countries sheds hoofs too hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron age known by marks in mouth
p00046_B,00046,B,it is accessible to reason sir and to nothing else
p00047_B,00047,B,thank you sir for hinting at the proposal but i will not set any sum against it knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative i have gone over the calculations in my mind and i find that to compound a felony even on very high terms indeed would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the bank
p00048_B,00048,B,i really wonder sir to find you taking a position so untenable my schooling was paid for it was a bargain and when i came away the bargain ended i don t deny that my schooling was cheap but that comes right sir i was made in the cheapest market and have to dispose of myself in the dearest pray don t do that it s of no use doing that it only worries you seem to think that i have some animosity against young mr tom whereas i have none at all i am only going on the reasonable grounds i have mentioned to take him back to coketown if he was to resist i should set up the cry of stop thief but he won t resist you may depend upon it
p00049_B,00049,B,bitzer have you a heart
p00050_B,00050,B,what motive even what motive in reason can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth and crushing his miserable father see his sister here pity us
p00051_B,00051,B,if this is solely a question of self interest with you
p00052_B,00052,B,now girl number twenty you know what a horse is
p00053_B,00053,B,is it accessible to any compassionate influence
p00054_B,00054,B,what sum of money will you set against your expected promotion
p00055_B,00055,B,bitzer bitzer i have but one chance left to soften you you were many years at my school if in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son i entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance
p00056_B,00056,B,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00057_B,00057,B,not the least in the world as long as you do it at once i never wear gloves i didn t climb up the ladder in them shouldn t be so high up if i had
p00058_B,00058,B,i thought you couldn t make em
p00059_B,00059,B,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p00060_B,00060,B,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00061_B,00061,B,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00062_B,00062,B,here
p00063_B,00063,B,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00064_B,00064,B,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00065_B,00065,B,i ll explain to you then why you wouldn t paper a room with representations of horses do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality in fact do you of course no why then you are not to see anywhere what you don t see in fact you are not to have anywhere what you don t have in fact what is called taste is only another name for fact this is a new principle a discovery a great discovery now i ll try you again suppose you were going to carpet a room would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it girl number twenty so you would carpet your room or your husband s room if you were a grown woman and had a husband with representations of flowers would you why would you
p00066_B,00066,B,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00067_B,00067,B,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p00068_B,00068,B,gin
p00069_B,00069,B,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p00070_B,00070,B,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p00071_B,00071,B,i don t see it at all sir
p00072_B,00072,B,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p00073_B,00073,B,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00074_B,00074,B,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse
p00075_B,00075,B,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00076_B,00076,B,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p00077_B,00077,B,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p00078_B,00078,B,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00079_B,00079,B,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p00080_B,00080,B,by your visiting proposition
p00081_B,00081,B,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p00082_B,00082,B,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00083_B,00083,B,very well that s a horse now let me ask you girls and boys would you paper a room with representations of horses
p00084_B,00084,B,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00085_B,00085,B,who do you mean by we
p00086_B,00086,B,missed his tip
p00087_B,00087,B,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p00088_B,00088,B,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p00089_B,00089,B,what made you think of this
p00090_B,00090,B,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p00091_B,00091,B,pray mrs gradgrind what passed
p00092_B,00092,B,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p00093_B,00093,B,you d like to keep her here for a time
p00094_B,00094,B,ah indeed and in that conversation
p00095_B,00095,B,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00096_B,00096,B,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00097_B,00097,B,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p00098_B,00098,B,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p00099_B,00099,B,i never mentioned his name
p00100_B,00100,B,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure
p00101_B,00101,B,i always come to a decision and whatever i do i do at once i should be surprised at tom gradgrind s addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown knowing what he knows of him if i could be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug i have given you my decision and i have got no more to say good night
p00102_B,00102,B,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p00103_B,00103,B,truly i think so bitzer turn you about and take yourself home jupe stay here a moment let me hear of your running in this manner any more boy and you will hear of me through the master of the school you understand what i mean go along
p00104_B,00104,B,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00105_B,00105,B,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p00106_B,00106,B,i am much of your opinion
p00107_B,00107,B,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00108_B,00108,B,you are not cecilia jupe to do anything of that kind
p00109_B,00109,B,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00110_B,00110,B,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p00111_B,00111,B,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p00112_B,00112,B,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p00113_B,00113,B,undoubtedly she is here
p00114_B,00114,B,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p00115_B,00115,B,and this is pod s end is it jupe
p00116_B,00116,B,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00117_B,00117,B,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p00118_B,00118,B,indeed
p00119_B,00119,B,cecilia jupe by name
p00120_B,00120,B,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p00121_B,00121,B,mr m choakumchild we only wait for you
p00122_B,00122,B,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p00123_B,00123,B,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p00124_B,00124,B,you have missed my letter
p00125_B,00125,B,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p00126_B,00126,B,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00127_B,00127,B,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p00128_B,00128,B,what do i mean bounderby
p00129_B,00129,B,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p00130_B,00130,B,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00131_B,00131,B,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p00132_B,00132,B,but even as an example to louisa of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity leads to and ends in think of it bounderby in that point of view
p00133_B,00133,B,you must paper it whether you like it or not don t tell us you wouldn t paper it what do you mean boy
p00134_B,00134,B,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00135_B,00135,B,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p00136_B,00136,B,bounderby this is unreasonable
p00137_B,00137,B,my dear bounderby
p00138_B,00138,B,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p00139_B,00139,B,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p00140_B,00140,B,if you put it in those terms
p00141_B,00141,B,not i fear to spare me
p00142_B,00142,B,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p00143_B,00143,B,fact fact fact
p00144_B,00144,B,if you please sir i am very fond of flowers
p00145_B,00145,B,dear no sir it s the nine oils
p00146_B,00146,B,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00147_B,00147,B,father is not in our room sir if you wouldn t mind walking in i ll find him directly father must have gone down to the booth sir i don t know why he should go there but he must be there i ll bring him in a minute
p00148_B,00148,B,it wouldn t hurt them sir they wouldn t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy
p00149_B,00149,B,the nine oils sir to rub father with
p00150_B,00150,B,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael
p00151_B,00151,B,the what
p00152_B,00152,B,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00153_B,00153,B,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00154_B,00154,B,ay ay ay but you mustn t fancy that s it you are never to fancy
p00155_B,00155,B,then what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for
p00156_B,00156,B,now good people all this is wanton waste of time let the girl understand the fact let her take it from me if you like who have been run away from myself here what s your name your father has absconded deserted you and you mustn t expect to see him again as long as you live
p00157_B,00157,B,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p00158_B,00158,B,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00159_B,00159,B,yes
p00160_B,00160,B,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00161_B,00161,B,no father i do not
p00162_B,00162,B,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00163_B,00163,B,i speak of my own life father
p00164_B,00164,B,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00165_B,00165,B,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00166_B,00166,B,wanted to see what it was like
p00167_B,00167,B,yes father
p00168_B,00168,B,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00169_B,00169,B,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00170_B,00170,B,i am as cheerful father as i usually am or usually have been
p00171_B,00171,B,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00172_B,00172,B,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00173_B,00173,B,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00174_B,00174,B,yes father
p00175_B,00175,B,yes father
p00176_B,00176,B,father i want to speak to you
p00177_B,00177,B,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00178_B,00178,B,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00179_B,00179,B,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p00180_B,00180,B,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00181_B,00181,B,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00182_B,00182,B,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p00183_B,00183,B,quite well father
p00184_B,00184,B,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00185_B,00185,B,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p00186_B,00186,B,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00187_B,00187,B,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00188_B,00188,B,dear father you have three young children left they will be different i will be different yet with heaven s help
p00189_B,00189,B,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00190_B,00190,B,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00191_B,00191,B,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p00192_B,00192,B,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00193_B,00193,B,sissy has effected it father
p00194_B,00194,B,none father what does it matter
p00195_B,00195,B,i do not reproach you father i make no complaint i am here with another object
p00196_B,00196,B,i say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence it matters very little how he gained it father he did gain it what you know of the story of my marriage he soon knew just as well i have done no worse i have not disgraced you but if you ask me whether i have loved him or do love him i tell you plainly father that it may be so i don t know this night my husband being away he has been with me declaring himself my lover this minute he expects me for i could release myself of his presence by no other means i do not know that i am sorry i do not know that i am ashamed i do not know that i am degraded in my own esteem all that i know is your philosophy and your teaching will not save me now father you have brought me to this save me by some other means i shall die if you hold me let me fall upon the ground
p00197_B,00197,B,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00198_B,00198,B,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00199_B,00199,B,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00200_B,00200,B,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00201_B,00201,B,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00202_B,00202,B,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00203_B,00203,B,shall i marry him
p00204_B,00204,B,and i so young in this condition father for i show you now without fear or favour the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know it you proposed my husband to me i took him i never made a pretence to him or you that i loved him i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom i made that wild escape into something visionary and have slowly found out how wild it was but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him it matters little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors when i was irrevocably married there rose up into rebellion against the tie the old strife made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me father until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul
p00205_B,00205,B,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00206_B,00206,B,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00207_B,00207,B,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00208_B,00208,B,very honest
p00209_B,00209,B,o no no no louisa
p00210_B,00210,B,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00211_B,00211,B,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p00212_B,00212,B,how matter what matter my dear
p00213_B,00213,B,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00214_B,00214,B,o my child my child i am an unhappy man to see you thus what avails it to me that you do not reproach me if i so bitterly reproach myself louisa i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house by mere love and gratitude that what the head had left undone and could not do the heart may have been doing silently can it be so i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear
p00215_B,00215,B,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p00216_B,00216,B,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00217_B,00217,B,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00218_B,00218,B,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p00219_B,00219,B,what it was like
p00220_B,00220,B,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00221_B,00221,B,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00222_B,00222,B,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00223_B,00223,B,and cheerful
p00224_B,00224,B,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00225_B,00225,B,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00226_B,00226,B,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p00227_B,00227,B,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00228_B,00228,B,my dear i must speak with you alone and seriously come to me in my room after breakfast to morrow will you
p00229_B,00229,B,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00230_B,00230,B,no no my poor child
p00231_B,00231,B,for you louisa
p00232_B,00232,B,my dear louisa you abundantly repay my care kiss me my dear girl i may assure you now my favourite child that i am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived mr bounderby is a very remarkable man and what little disparity can be said to exist between you if any is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired it has always been my object so to educate you as that you might while still in your early youth be if i may so express myself almost any age kiss me once more louisa now let us go and find your mother
p00233_B,00233,B,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p00234_B,00234,B,certainly my dear
p00235_B,00235,B,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00236_B,00236,B,what is the matter how strange you look and good heaven have you come here exposed to this storm
p00237_B,00237,B,what is it i conjure you louisa tell me what is the matter
p00238_B,00238,B,your hands are rather cold louisa are you not well
p00239_B,00239,B,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00240_B,00240,B,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p00241_B,00241,B,tired of what
p00242_B,00242,B,say not another word you are childish i will hear no more what would your best friends say louisa do you attach no value to their good opinion what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say
p00243_B,00243,B,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00244_B,00244,B,louisa
p00245_B,00245,B,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00246_B,00246,B,not now my dears in the evening i am not able yet to morrow
p00247_B,00247,B,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00248_B,00248,B,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00249_B,00249,B,it is always you my child
p00250_B,00250,B,that s well
p00251_B,00251,B,yes louisa
p00252_B,00252,B,curse the hour curse the hour
p00253_B,00253,B,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00254_B,00254,B,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00255_B,00255,B,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00256_B,00256,B,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00257_B,00257,B,and you so young louisa
p00258_B,00258,B,yes louisa
p00259_B,00259,B,my dear quite true quite true
p00260_B,00260,B,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00261_B,00261,B,and her confidence not to be shaken i ask myself does the real culprit know of these accusations where is he who is he
p00262_B,00262,B,no as wet as a sop a foot of water in it
p00263_B,00263,B,cold i was born with inflammation of the lungs and of everything else i believe that was capable of inflammation for years ma am i was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen i was so sickly that i was always moaning and groaning i was so ragged and dirty that you wouldn t have touched me with a pair of tongs how i fought through it i don t know i was determined i suppose i have been a determined character in later life and i suppose i was then here i am mrs gradgrind anyhow and nobody to thank for my being here but myself my mother bolted ma am my mother left me to my grandmother and according to the best of my remembrance my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived if i got a little pair of shoes by any chance she would take em off and sell em for drink why i have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four teen glasses of liquor before breakfast she kept a chandler s shop and kept me in an egg box that was the cot of my infancy an old egg box as soon as i was big enough to run away of course i ran away then i became a young vagabond and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me they were right they had no business to do anything else i was a nuisance an incumbrance and a pest i know that very well i was to pull through it i suppose mrs gradgrind whether i was to do it or not ma am i did it i pulled through it though nobody threw me out a rope vagabond errand boy vagabond labourer porter clerk chief manager small partner josiah bounderby of coketown those are the antecedents and the culmination josiah bounderby of coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops mrs gradgrind and was first able to tell the time upon a dial plate from studying the steeple clock of st giles s church london under the direction of a drunken cripple who was a convicted thief and an incorrigible vagrant tell josiah bounderby of coketown of your district schools and your model schools and your training schools and your whole kettle of fish of schools and josiah bounderby of coketown tells you plainly all right all correct he hadn t such advantages but let us have hard headed solid fisted people the education that made him won t do for everybody he knows well such and such his education was however and you may force him to swallow boiling fat but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life
p00264_B,00264,B,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00265_B,00265,B,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00266_B,00266,B,you can take one mr bounderby
p00267_B,00267,B,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00268_B,00268,B,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00269_B,00269,B,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00270_B,00270,B,tom i wonder
p00271_B,00271,B,what is the matter with you what has given you offence
p00272_B,00272,B,i suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident or too delicate i have never made that objection to you either as a child or as a woman i don t understand what you would have
p00273_B,00273,B,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00274_B,00274,B,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him
p00275_B,00275,B,whatever i am to call him mr gradgrind when he is married to louisa i must call him something it s impossible to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name i cannot call him josiah for the name is insupportable to me you yourself wouldn t hear of joe you very well know am i to call my own son in law mister not i believe unless the time has arrived when as an invalid i am to be trampled upon by my relations then what am i to call him as to the wedding all i ask louisa is and i ask it with a fluttering in my chest which actually extends to the soles of my feet that it may take place soon otherwise i know it is one of those subjects i shall never hear the last of
p00276_B,00276,B,are you in pain dear mother
p00277_B,00277,B,that s the reason
p00278_B,00278,B,about what mother don t be troubled about what
p00279_B,00279,B,yes mother i should think her like me but
p00280_B,00280,B,i can hear you mother
p00281_B,00281,B,i want to hear of you mother not of myself
p00282_B,00282,B,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00283_B,00283,B,you were going to speak to me mother
p00284_B,00284,B,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00285_B,00285,B,tom have you anything to tell me if ever you loved me in your life and have anything concealed from every one besides tell it to me
p00286_B,00286,B,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00287_B,00287,B,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly
p00288_B,00288,B,eh yes to be sure my dear you know your father is almost always away now and therefore i must write to him about it
p00289_B,00289,B,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything
p00290_B,00290,B,i think there s a pain somewhere in the room but i couldn t positively say that i have got it you very seldom see your sister she grows like you i wish you would look at her sissy bring her here do you see the likeness louisa
p00291_B,00291,B,nonsense nonsense don t stand there and tell me such stuff louisa to my face when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father s ears i should never hear the last of it after all the trouble that has been taken with you after the lectures you have attended and the experiments you have seen after i have heard you myself when the whole of my right side has been benumbed going on with your master about combustion and calcination and calorification and i may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes i wish yes i really do wish that i had never had a family and then you would have known what it was to do without me
p00292_B,00292,B,but there is something not an ology at all that your father has missed or forgotten louisa i don t know what it is i have often sat with sissy near me and thought about it i shall never get its name now but your father may it makes me restless i want to write to him to find out for god s sake what it is give me a pen give me a pen
p00293_B,00293,B,eh yes i always say so and that reminds me i i want to speak to you my dear sissy my good girl leave us alone a minute
p00294_B,00294,B,you want to hear of me my dear that s something new i am sure when anybody wants to hear of me not at all well louisa very faint and giddy
p00295_B,00295,B,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00296_B,00296,B,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00297_B,00297,B,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00298_B,00298,B,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time
p00299_B,00299,B,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00300_B,00300,B,why couldn t you say so young tom
p00301_B,00301,B,always my pet ain t you louisa good bye louisa
p00302_B,00302,B,offence do you suppose if there was any offence given me i shouldn t name it and request to have it corrected i am a straightforward man i believe i don t go beating about for side winds
p00303_B,00303,B,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p00304_B,00304,B,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p00305_B,00305,B,what a game girl you are to be such a first rate sister loo old bounderby s quite ready time s up good bye i shall be on the look out for you when you come back i say my dear loo an t it uncommonly jolly now
p00306_B,00306,B,well then don t begin with me
p00307_B,00307,B,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p00308_B,00308,B,what are you about loo you ll rub a hole in your face
p00309_B,00309,B,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards

p00313_B,00313,B,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00314_B,00314,B,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p00315_B,00315,B,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00316_B,00316,B,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00317_B,00317,B,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00318_B,00318,B,you don t hate sissy tom
p00319_B,00319,B,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00320_B,00320,B,no
p00321_B,00321,B,your revenge tom
p00322_B,00322,B,he seemed to me an honest man

p00324_B,00324,B,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it

p00326_B,00326,B,o tom tom do we end so after all my love
p00327_B,00327,B,not me i hope tom
p00328_B,00328,B,ought i to say after what has happened that i made that visit should i say so must i say so
p00329_B,00329,B,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00330_B,00330,B,i have such unmanageable thoughts that they will wonder
p00331_B,00331,B,as you lie here alone my dear in the melancholy night so you must lie somewhere one night when even i if i am living then shall have left you as i am here beside you barefoot unclothed undistinguishable in darkness so must i lie through all the night of my decay until i am dust in the name of that time tom tell me the truth now
p00332_B,00332,B,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00333_B,00333,B,you may be certain that i will not reproach you you may be certain that i will be compassionate and true to you you may be certain that i will save you at whatever cost o tom have you nothing to tell me whisper very softly say only and i shall understand you not a word tom
p00334_B,00334,B,i wouldn t have you do that to night tom of all the nights in your life many and much happier as i hope they will be
p00335_B,00335,B,tom have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people and that we saw those three together
p00336_B,00336,B,you are tired
p00337_B,00337,B,yes tom
p00338_B,00338,B,you may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like tom i wouldn t cry
p00339_B,00339,B,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00340_B,00340,B,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00341_B,00341,B,yes but i did not know then what was going to happen
p00342_B,00342,B,you have nothing more to tell me
p00343_B,00343,B,tom do you believe the man i gave the money to is really implicated in this crime
p00344_B,00344,B,no dear tom i won t forget
p00345_B,00345,B,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00346_B,00346,B,i ll come directly
p00347_B,00347,B,was he offended by what you said
p00348_B,00348,B,you have been so hurried and disturbed to day have any fresh discoveries been made
p00349_B,00349,B,no she does not tom i am sure
p00350_B,00350,B,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00351_B,00351,B,no i wasn t sir not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say it s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn t known to the horse riders
p00352_B,00352,B,he frightened me so with his cruel faces
p00353_B,00353,B,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00354_B,00354,B,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week
p00355_B,00355,B,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00356_B,00356,B,by your leaves gentlemen it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe
p00357_B,00357,B,kidderminster stow that
p00358_B,00358,B,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00359_B,00359,B,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00360_B,00360,B,i never saw the man in my life
p00361_B,00361,B,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00362_B,00362,B,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00363_B,00363,B,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00364_B,00364,B,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00365_B,00365,B,yes i was
p00366_B,00366,B,has what has he missed
p00367_B,00367,B,why has he been so very much goosed
p00368_B,00368,B,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00369_B,00369,B,oh that is tip is it
p00370_B,00370,B,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00371_B,00371,B,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00372_B,00372,B,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00373_B,00373,B,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00374_B,00374,B,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now
p00375_B,00375,B,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00376_B,00376,B,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00377_B,00377,B,lower yourself then oh lord if you ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to let yourself down a bit
p00378_B,00378,B,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00379_B,00379,B,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00380_B,00380,B,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00381_B,00381,B,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00382_B,00382,B,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00383_B,00383,B,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00384_B,00384,B,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00385_B,00385,B,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00386_B,00386,B,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00387_B,00387,B,perhaps so
p00388_B,00388,B,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00389_B,00389,B,a cackler here we go again
p00390_B,00390,B,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00391_B,00391,B,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00392_B,00392,B,this is a very obtrusive lad
p00393_B,00393,B,we d have had a young gentleman to meet you if we had known you were coming it s a pity you don t have a bespeak being so particular you re on the tight jeff ain t you
p00394_B,00394,B,must find out mr sleary who would then let him know where you went i should have no power of keeping you against his wish and he would have no difficulty at any time in finding mr thomas gradgrind of coketown i am well known
p00395_B,00395,B,here is your letter all necessary means will be provided for you atone by repentance and better conduct for the shocking action you have committed and the dreadful consequences to which it has led give me your hand my poor boy and may god forgive you as i do
p00396_B,00396,B,it is of no moment whether this person is to be expected back at any time or the contrary he is gone away and there is no present expectation of his return that i believe is agreed on all hands
p00397_B,00397,B,yes
p00398_B,00398,B,well then i who came here to inform the father of the poor girl jupe that she could not be received at the school any more in consequence of there being practical objections into which i need not enter to the reception there of the children of persons so employed am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal i am willing to take charge of you jupe and to educate you and provide for you the only condition over and above your good behaviour i make is that you decide now at once whether to accompany me or remain here also that if you accompany me now it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present these observations comprise the whole of the case

p00404_B,00404,B,the only observation i will make to you jupe in the way of influencing your decision is that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education and that even your father himself from what i understand appears on your behalf to have known and felt that much be sure you know your own mind jupe i say no more be sure you know your own mind
p00405_B,00405,B,his scent being so fine

p00439_B,00439,B,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00440_B,00440,B,i haven t played backgammon ma am since that time
p00441_B,00441,B,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00442_B,00442,B,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00443_B,00443,B,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl

p00445_B,00445,B,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00446_B,00446,B,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00447_B,00447,B,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00448_B,00448,B,now you know this good lady is a born lady a high lady you are not to suppose because she keeps my house for me that she hasn t been very high up the tree ah up at the top of the tree now if you have got anything to say that can t be said before a born lady this lady will leave the room if what you have got to say can be said before a born lady this lady will stay where she is
p00449_B,00449,B,bite your nose off ma am your nose
p00450_B,00450,B,why don t you mind your own business ma am how dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs

p00452_B,00452,B,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00453_B,00453,B,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00454_B,00454,B,nor yet in a week ma am
p00455_B,00455,B,in a similar manner ma am i can wait you know if romulus and remus could wait josiah bounderby can wait they were better off in their youth than i was however they had a she wolf for a nurse i had only a she wolf for a grandmother she didn t give any milk ma am she gave bruises she was a regular alderney at that
p00456_B,00456,B,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed
p00457_B,00457,B,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00458_B,00458,B,allow me to open the door ma am
p00459_B,00459,B,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00460_B,00460,B,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00461_B,00461,B,well why don t you go on
p00462_B,00462,B,you had better allow me ma am
p00463_B,00463,B,why i have got out of the habit of taking it now ma am
p00464_B,00464,B,now confound this woman who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way
p00465_B,00465,B,it appears to me ma am i say that a different sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of your powers such an establishment as your relation lady scadgers s now don t you think you might find some affairs there ma am to interfere with
p00466_B,00466,B,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00467_B,00467,B,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00468_B,00468,B,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00469_B,00469,B,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00470_B,00470,B,if i waited to be taken care of by my wife ma am i believe you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday so i ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot
p00471_B,00471,B,you hear what this lady asks was it an unequal marriage in point of years this unlucky job of yours
p00472_B,00472,B,yes ma am
p00473_B,00473,B,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00474_B,00474,B,then suppose you try ma am you can take your own time for going ma am but perhaps in the meanwhile it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind to eat her meals by herself and not to be intruded upon i really ought to apologise to you being only josiah bounderby of coketown for having stood in your light so long because i can take the opportunity of saying a word to you before you go mrs sparsit ma am i rather think you are cramped here do you know it appears to me that under my humble roof there s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people s affairs and it appears to my poor judgment
p00475_B,00475,B,why what do you mean by this i ask you what do you mean by this mrs sparsit ma am
p00476_B,00476,B,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00477_B,00477,B,what s the matter ma am you don t see a fire do you
p00478_B,00478,B,what have you got to do with the dew ma am
p00479_B,00479,B,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00480_B,00480,B,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00481_B,00481,B,i am going ma am to marry tom gradgrind s daughter
p00482_B,00482,B,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00483_B,00483,B,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am
p00484_B,00484,B,she never takes cold
p00485_B,00485,B,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00486_B,00486,B,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00487_B,00487,B,what do you mean ma am
p00488_B,00488,B,may i ask sir have you been ruffled this morning
p00489_B,00489,B,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00490_B,00490,B,i can go mr bounderby if you wish it
p00491_B,00491,B,it is apparent to me that i am in your way at present i will retire to my own apartment sir
p00492_B,00492,B,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00493_B,00493,B,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00494_B,00494,B,oh pray sir don t disparage your judgment everybody knows how unerring mr bounderby s judgment is everybody has had proofs of it it must be the theme of general conversation disparage anything in yourself but your judgment sir
p00495_B,00495,B,no indeed sir
p00496_B,00496,B,yes sir i hope you may be happy mr bounderby oh indeed i hope you may be happy sir
p00497_B,00497,B,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00498_B,00498,B,it s not myself sir i am fearful of miss gradgrind s taking cold
p00499_B,00499,B,oh dear no sir i was thinking of the dew
p00500_B,00500,B,yes sir it is unquestionably true
p00501_B,00501,B,the girl is now waiting to know whether she is to go straight to the school or up to the lodge
p00502_B,00502,B,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00503_B,00503,B,it is true sir
p00504_B,00504,B,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again
p00505_B,00505,B,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00506_B,00506,B,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00507_B,00507,B,mr bounderby sir
p00508_B,00508,B,pray sir do not bite my nose off
p00509_B,00509,B,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00510_B,00510,B,of course she can if you wish it mr bounderby
p00511_B,00511,B,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00512_B,00512,B,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00513_B,00513,B,if not quite
p00514_B,00514,B,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p00515_B,00515,B,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00516_B,00516,B,thank you sir i can do it for myself
p00517_B,00517,B,no sir i am aware that you have not i remember that miss gradgrind takes no interest in the game but i shall be happy sir if you will condescend
p00518_B,00518,B,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00519_B,00519,B,thank you sir
p00520_B,00520,B,really sir
p00521_B,00521,B,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00522_B,00522,B,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00523_B,00523,B,it never occurred to me before sir but now you mention it should think it highly probable
p00524_B,00524,B,are you speaking of young miss gradgrind mr bounderby
p00525_B,00525,B,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00526_B,00526,B,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00527_B,00527,B,sir there was wont to be an elasticity in you which i sadly miss be buoyant sir
p00528_B,00528,B,very true sir
p00529_B,00529,B,was it an unequal marriage sir in point of years
p00530_B,00530,B,may i inquire sir whether i am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper
p00531_B,00531,B,i have already had the honour
p00532_B,00532,B,pray don t name it sir if that portrait could speak sir but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others it would testify that a long period has elapsed since i first habitually addressed it as the picture of a noodle nothing that a noodle does can awaken surprise or indignation the proceedings of a noodle can only inspire contempt
p00533_B,00533,B,sir
p00534_B,00534,B,i do not sir deny it
p00535_B,00535,B,really sir oh sir not your sherry warm with lemon peel and nutmeg
p00536_B,00536,B,the more s the pity sir you are losing all your good old habits cheer up sir if miss gradgrind will permit me i will offer to make it for you as i have often done
p00537_B,00537,B,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00538_B,00538,B,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00539_B,00539,B,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00540_B,00540,B,yes sir
p00541_B,00541,B,ah
p00542_B,00542,B,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00543_B,00543,B,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00544_B,00544,B,indeed mr bounderby very thoughtful of you
p00545_B,00545,B,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00546_B,00546,B,jupe i have made up my mind to take you into my house and when you are not in attendance at the school to employ you about mrs gradgrind who is rather an invalid i have explained to miss louisa this is miss louisa the miserable but natural end of your late career and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past and is not to be referred to any more from this time you begin your history you are at present ignorant i know
p00547_B,00547,B,how was what done
p00548_B,00548,B,i suppose i must i can t be more miserable anywhere than i have been here ever since i can remember that s one thing
p00549_B,00549,B,not you i don t want to have anything to say to you
p00550_B,00550,B,i am sick of my life loo i hate it altogether and i hate everybody except you
p00551_B,00551,B,i don t see why so many people are employed in situations of trust so many people out of so many will be dishonest i have heard you talk a hundred times of its being a law how can i help laws you have comforted others with such things father comfort yourself
p00552_B,00552,B,i wish i could collect all the facts we hear so much about and all the figures and all the people who found them out and i wish i could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together however when i go to live with old bounderby i ll have my revenge
p00553_B,00553,B,you seem to find more to look at in it than ever i could find another of the advantages i suppose of being a girl
p00554_B,00554,B,not but what i shall be very unwilling both to leave you loo and to leave you here but i must go you know whether i like it or not and i had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence than where i should lose it altogether don t you see
p00555_B,00555,B,thank you my dear loo i am so tired that i am sure i wonder i don t say anything to get to sleep go to bed go to bed
p00556_B,00556,B,oh you you are a girl loo and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does i don t miss anything in you you are the only pleasure i have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like
p00557_B,00557,B,why there s one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home
p00558_B,00558,B,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it

p00588_B,00588,B,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is

p00624_B,00624,B,to make the people laugh
p00625_B,00625,B,have i always hated you so much
p00626_B,00626,B,i don t know that you are more useful to my mother and more pleasant with her than i can ever be you are pleasanter to yourself than i am to my self
p00627_B,00627,B,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00628_B,00628,B,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00629_B,00629,B,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00630_B,00630,B,no
p00631_B,00631,B,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00632_B,00632,B,o lay it here lay it here my dear
p00633_B,00633,B,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00634_B,00634,B,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00635_B,00635,B,am i i would be something to you if i might
p00636_B,00636,B,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00637_B,00637,B,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00638_B,00638,B,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00639_B,00639,B,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00640_B,00640,B,o no they know everything
p00641_B,00641,B,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try
p00642_B,00642,B,always always kinder and kinder than i can tell he was angry only one night and that was not to me but merrylegs merrylegs is his performing dog
p00643_B,00643,B,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00644_B,00644,B,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00645_B,00645,B,whatever you want most if i could be that at all events i would like to try to be as near it as i can and however far off that may be i will never tire of trying will you let me
p00646_B,00646,B,then mr m choakumchild said he would try me once more and he said here are the stutterings
p00647_B,00647,B,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00648_B,00648,B,it is mr bounderby and your brother mr tom and a young woman who says her name is rachael and that you know her
p00649_B,00649,B,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00650_B,00650,B,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00651_B,00651,B,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and
p00652_B,00652,B,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00653_B,00653,B,yes miss louisa they always remind me of stutterings and that s another of my mistakes of accidents upon the sea and i find mr m choakumchild said that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death what is the percentage and i said miss i said it was nothing
p00654_B,00654,B,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00655_B,00655,B,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00656_B,00656,B,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00657_B,00657,B,they want to see you rachael has been crying and seems angry
p00658_B,00658,B,no
p00659_B,00659,B,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00660_B,00660,B,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone
p00661_B,00661,B,there s no more to tell miss louisa i keep the nine oils ready for him and i know he will come back every letter that i see in mr gradgrind s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes for i think it comes from father or from mr sleary about father mr sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of and i trust to him to keep his word
p00662_B,00662,B,i beg your pardon sir for being troublesome but have you had any letter yet about me
p00663_B,00663,B,do look sharp for old bounderby loo he ll be off if you don t look sharp
p00664_B,00664,B,i say look sharp for old bounderby loo
p00665_B,00665,B,thou lt write to me and tell me all that happens stephen
p00666_B,00666,B,try to think not and twill seem better

p00760_B,00760,B,of course there is
p00761_B,00761,B,here s a gentleman from london present a parliament gentleman i should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me instead of taking the substance of it for i know precious well beforehand what it will be nobody knows better than i do take notice instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth now what do you complain of
p00762_B,00762,B,no how
p00763_B,00763,B,i ll tell you something towards it at any rate we will make an example of half a dozen slackbridges we ll indict the blackguards for felony and get em shipped off to penal settlements don t tell me we won t man because we will i tell you
p00764_B,00764,B,not to me you know
p00765_B,00765,B,just stop a moment i told you the last time you were here with a grievance that you had better turn about and come out of that and i also told you if you remember that i was up to the gold spoon look out
p00766_B,00766,B,certainly not
p00767_B,00767,B,of course there is
p00768_B,00768,B,though he knows that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for now mr harthouse you have been knocking about in the world some time did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country
p00769_B,00769,B,why you d have to go to doctors commons with a suit and you d have to go to a court of common law with a suit and you d have to go to the house of lords with a suit and you d have to get an act of parliament to enable you to marry again and it would cost you if it was a case of very plain sailing i suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound perhaps twice the money
p00770_B,00770,B,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money
p00771_B,00771,B,why i have told you speak up like a man since you are a man and tell us about yourself and this combination
p00772_B,00772,B,what do you mean what are you talking about you took her for better for worse
p00773_B,00773,B,i was acquainted with all this you know except the last clause long ago it s a bad job that s what it is you had better have been satisfied as you were and not have got married however it s too late to say that
p00774_B,00774,B,what do you people in a general way complain of
p00775_B,00775,B,ah how it happens
p00776_B,00776,B,you said ah i know what you said more than that i know what you mean you see not always the same thing by the lord harry quite different things you had better tell us at once that that fellow slackbridge is not in the town stirring up the people to mutiny and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people that is a most confounded scoundrel you had better tell us so at once you can t deceive me you want to tell us so why don t you
p00777_B,00777,B,pooh pooh don t you talk nonsense my good fellow about things you don t understand and don t you call the institutions of your country a muddle or you ll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings the institutions of your country are not your piece work and the only thing you have got to do is to mind your piece work you didn t take your wife for fast and for loose but for better for worse if she has turned out worse why all we have got to say is she might have turned out better
p00778_B,00778,B,in short it s because they are so full of virtues that they have turned you adrift go through with it while you are about it out with it
p00779_B,00779,B,of course there is
p00780_B,00780,B,now i ll tell you what with what i shall call your unhallowed opinions you have been quite shocking this lady who as i have already told you is a born lady and who as i have not already told you has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds tens of thousands of pounds now you have always been a steady hand hitherto but my opinion is and so i tell you plainly that you are turning into the wrong road you have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other they re always about and the best thing you can do is to come out of that now you know i can see as far into a grindstone as another man farther than a good many perhaps because i had my nose well kept to it when i was young i see traces of the turtle soup and venison and gold spoon in this yes i do by the lord harry i do
p00781_B,00781,B,now it s clear to me that you are one of those chaps who have always got a grievance and you go about sowing it and raising crops that s the business of your life my friend you are such a waspish raspish ill conditioned chap you see that even your own union the men who know you best will have nothing to do with you i never thought those fellows could be right in anything but i tell you what i so far go along with them for a novelty that i ll have nothing to do with you either you can finish off what you re at and then go elsewhere
p00782_B,00782,B,very well you re a steady hand and i was not mistaken now let me hear what it s all about as it s not that let me hear what it is what have you got to say out with it lad
p00783_B,00783,B,i have heard all this before she took to drinking left off working sold the furniture pawned the clothes and played old gooseberry
p00784_B,00784,B,as for me any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it if only josiah bounderby of coketown had been in question you would have joined and made no bones about it
p00785_B,00785,B,now my friend if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute i should like to have a word or two with you you said just now that you had nothing to tell us about this business you are quite sure of that before we go any further
p00786_B,00786,B,hem there s a sanctity in this relation of life and and it must be kept up
p00787_B,00787,B,now you ll think this pretty well harthouse you ll think this tolerably strong you ll say upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with but this is nothing sir you shall hear me ask this man a question pray mr blackpool may i take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this combination
p00788_B,00788,B,now look here harthouse here s a specimen of em when this man was here once before i warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about and who ought to be hanged wherever they are found and i told this man that he was going in the wrong direction now would you believe it that although they have put this mark upon him he is such a slave to them still that he s afraid to open his lips about them
p00789_B,00789,B,of course there is
p00790_B,00790,B,what i know i know and what you know you know i have no more to say about it
p00791_B,00791,B,of course now perhaps you ll let the gentleman know how you would set this muddle as you re so fond of calling it to rights
p00792_B,00792,B,the more fool you i think
p00793_B,00793,B,he wishes to be free to marry the female of whom he speaks i fear sir
p00794_B,00794,B,indeed sir i inferred from its being so miserable a marriage that it was probably an unequal one in point of years
p00795_B,00795,B,i do the lady says what s right i do i were a coming to t i ha read i th papers that great folk fair faw em a i wishes em no hurt are not bonded together for better for worst so fast but that they can be set free fro their misfortnet marriages an marry ower agen when they dunnot agree for that their tempers is ill sorted they has rooms o one kind an another in their houses above a bit and they can live asunders we fok ha only one room and we can t when that won t do they ha gowd an other cash an they can say an they can go their separate ways we can t spite o all that they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine so i mun be ridden o this woman and i want t know how

p00809_B,00809,B,he is to be pitied ma am the last party i have alluded to is to be pitied ma am

p00854_B,00854,B,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00855_B,00855,B,i beg your pardon pray excuse me
p00856_B,00856,B,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00857_B,00857,B,highly so
p00858_B,00858,B,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00859_B,00859,B,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00860_B,00860,B,beg your pardon really was
p00861_B,00861,B,thank you allow me i left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the van and strolled on looking about me exceedingly odd place will you allow me to ask you if it s always as black as this
p00862_B,00862,B,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00863_B,00863,B,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00864_B,00864,B,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00865_B,00865,B,is it possible excuse me you are not a native i think
p00866_B,00866,B,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00867_B,00867,B,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00868_B,00868,B,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00869_B,00869,B,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00870_B,00870,B,yes he had that honour
p00871_B,00871,B,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00872_B,00872,B,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00873_B,00873,B,humph five and thirty good looking good figure good teeth good voice good breeding well dressed dark hair bold eyes
p00874_B,00874,B,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00875_B,00875,B,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00876_B,00876,B,indeed sir is she
p00877_B,00877,B,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00878_B,00878,B,a powler

p00882_B,00882,B,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00883_B,00883,B,no sir it was once my good or ill fortune as it may be before i became a widow to move in a very different sphere my husband was a powler
p00884_B,00884,B,we live in a singular world sir
p00885_B,00885,B,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00886_B,00886,B,oh really
p00887_B,00887,B,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00888_B,00888,B,is anybody suspected
p00889_B,00889,B,you don t mean it

p00891_B,00891,B,i have heard you and so has this brute i have heard nothing else
p00892_B,00892,B,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00893_B,00893,B,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00894_B,00894,B,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00895_B,00895,B,of much
p00896_B,00896,B,of how much
p00897_B,00897,B,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00898_B,00898,B,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00899_B,00899,B,heard what
p00900_B,00900,B,suspicious certainly

p00902_B,00902,B,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00903_B,00903,B,where is tom by the by
p00904_B,00904,B,harthouse you have a couple of horses down here bring half a dozen more if you like and we ll find room for em there s stabling in this place for a dozen horses and unless nickits is belied he kept the full number a round dozen of em sir when that man was a boy he went to westminster school went to westminster school as a king s scholar when i was principally living on garbage and sleeping in market baskets why if i wanted to keep a dozen horses which i don t for one s enough for me i couldn t bear to see em in their stalls here and think what my own lodging used to be i couldn t look at em sir and not order em out yet so things come round you see this place you know what sort of a place it is you are aware that there s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere i don t care where and here got into the middle of it like a maggot into a nut is josiah bounderby while nickits as a man came into my office and told me yesterday nickits who used to act in latin in the westminster school plays with the chief justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face is drivelling at this minute drivelling sir in a fifth floor up a narrow dark back street in antwerp
p00905_B,00905,B,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00906_B,00906,B,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00907_B,00907,B,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00908_B,00908,B,then you haven t heard
p00909_B,00909,B,robbed last night sir robbed in an extraordinary manner robbed with a false key
p00910_B,00910,B,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00911_B,00911,B,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00912_B,00912,B,suppose it might by the lord you may suppose so by george it might have been twice twenty there s no knowing what it would have been or wouldn t have been as it was but for the fellows being disturbed
p00913_B,00913,B,now speak up
p00914_B,00914,B,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00915_B,00915,B,the bank s robbed
p00916_B,00916,B,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00917_B,00917,B,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00918_B,00918,B,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00919_B,00919,B,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00920_B,00920,B,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00921_B,00921,B,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00922_B,00922,B,not here
p00923_B,00923,B,not here
p00924_B,00924,B,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00925_B,00925,B,his face and his manner and what he said
p00926_B,00926,B,yes
p00927_B,00927,B,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00928_B,00928,B,i do not think it likely
p00929_B,00929,B,being so impulsive
p00930_B,00930,B,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00931_B,00931,B,no
p00932_B,00932,B,i do not think that likely either
p00933_B,00933,B,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00934_B,00934,B,i know he does
p00935_B,00935,B,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00936_B,00936,B,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00937_B,00937,B,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00938_B,00938,B,have you none of your own
p00939_B,00939,B,yes
p00940_B,00940,B,no certainly
p00941_B,00941,B,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00942_B,00942,B,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00943_B,00943,B,you are a singular politician
p00944_B,00944,B,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00945_B,00945,B,where louisa
p00946_B,00946,B,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00947_B,00947,B,thank you i claim to deserve it you know how little i do claim but i will go that length you have done so much for him you are so fond of him your whole life mrs bounderby expresses such charming self forgetfulness on his account pardon me again i am running wide of the subject i am interested in him for his own sake mrs bounderby it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother s years if he is heedless inconsiderate and expensive a little dissipated in the common phrase is he
p00948_B,00948,B,allow me to be frank do you think he games at all i think he makes bets
p00949_B,00949,B,but we have so little time to make so much of and i have come so far and am altogether so devoted and distracted there never was a slave at once so devoted and ill used by his mistress to look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life and to be received in your frozen manner is heart rending
p00950_B,00950,B,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00951_B,00951,B,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00952_B,00952,B,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00953_B,00953,B,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00954_B,00954,B,your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed though i am the most unfortunate fellow in the world i believe to have been insensible to all other women and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the most beautiful and the most engaging and the most imperious my dearest louisa i cannot go myself or let you go in this hard abuse of your power
p00955_B,00955,B,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00956_B,00956,B,pardon me i have not even that merit we are the largest party in the state i assure you mrs bounderby if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together
p00957_B,00957,B,oh perfectly
p00958_B,00958,B,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00959_B,00959,B,i only say what is reasonable nothing worse i have talked it over with my friend tom more than once of course i remain on terms of perfect confidence with tom and he is quite of my opinion and i am quite of his will you walk
p00960_B,00960,B,of course he loses
p00961_B,00961,B,to relieve you from needless apprehension and as this confidence regarding your brother which i prize i am sure above all possible things has been established between us i obey i cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word look and act of his life of the affection of his best friend of the devotion of his best friend of her unselfishness of her sacrifice the return he makes her within my observation is a very poor one what she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude not his ill humour and caprice careless fellow as i am i am not so indifferent mrs bounderby as to be regardless of this vice in your brother or inclined to consider it a venial offence in a word it is to correct your brother in this mrs bounderby that i must aspire my better knowledge of his circumstances and my direction and advice in extricating them rather valuable i hope as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale will give me some influence over him and all i gain i shall certainly use towards this end i have said enough and more than enough i seem to be protesting that i am a sort of good fellow when upon my honour i have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect and openly announce that i am nothing of the sort yonder among the trees is your brother himself no doubt just come down as he seems to be loitering in this direction it may be as well perhaps to walk towards him and throw ourselves in his way he has been very silent and doleful of late perhaps his brotherly conscience is touched if there are such things as consciences though upon my honour i hear of them much too often to believe in them
p00962_B,00962,B,now how am i to take this
p00963_B,00963,B,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00964_B,00964,B,everybody does lose who bets may i hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes acquit me of impertinent curiosity my dear mrs bounderby i think tom may be gradually falling into trouble and i wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience shall i say again for his sake is that necessary candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father
p00965_B,00965,B,nor of any other such person
p00966_B,00966,B,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00967_B,00967,B,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00968_B,00968,B,but we must meet my dear louisa where shall we meet shall i ride up to the house a few minutes hence innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me
p00969_B,00969,B,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00970_B,00970,B,so spirited too
p00971_B,00971,B,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p00972_B,00972,B,never mind that now
p00973_B,00973,B,but my dear tom if your sister has not got it
p00974_B,00974,B,ay ay has resources of her own
p00975_B,00975,B,perfectly delightful and she gets on so placidly
p00976_B,00976,B,so much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for so much the less so much the less
p00977_B,00977,B,it was charming tom
p00978_B,00978,B,don t mind me but take care when his wife is by you know
p00979_B,00979,B,so much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for so much the more so much the more
p00980_B,00980,B,that s the past tense tom we are in the present tense now
p00981_B,00981,B,did you see your sister
p00982_B,00982,B,tom you are inconsiderate you expect too much of your sister you have had money of her you dog you know you have
p00983_B,00983,B,where
p00984_B,00984,B,whose name tom have you been carving on the trees
p00985_B,00985,B,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00986_B,00986,B,formed his daughter on his own model
p00987_B,00987,B,my dear fellow what am i bound to suppose when i find two married people living in harmony and happiness
p00988_B,00988,B,you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature s on the bark tom
p00989_B,00989,B,come it s late be off
p00990_B,00990,B,good very quaint though you don t mean it
p00991_B,00991,B,so whether i am waiting for a hostile message or an assignation or a penitent remonstrance or an impromptu wrestle with my friend bounderby in the lancashire manner which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs i ll dine bounderby has the advantage in point of weight and if anything of a british nature is to come off between us it may be as well to be in training some dinner at six with a beefsteak in it
p00992_B,00992,B,what a comical brother in law you are
p00993_B,00993,B,i was prevented from coming detained
p00994_B,00994,B,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p00995_B,00995,B,and your intelligent sister
p00996_B,00996,B,what is the present need tom three figures out with them say what they are
p00997_B,00997,B,you are a piece of caustic tom
p00998_B,00998,B,whelp whelp what an ass you are
p00999_B,00999,B,where were you last night tom
p01000_B,01000,B,my good fellow so am i
p01001_B,01001,B,come tom i can hardly believe that a joke s a joke
p01002_B,01002,B,well it may be of more use by and by and my good fellow if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you i may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself
p01003_B,01003,B,impossible
p01004_B,01004,B,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p01005_B,01005,B,very dutiful in your interesting sister
p01006_B,01006,B,now you see tom every man is selfish in everything he does and i am exactly like the rest of my fellow creatures i am desperately intent on your softening towards your sister which you ought to do and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother which you ought to be
p01007_B,01007,B,no time like the present tom begin at once
p01008_B,01008,B,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p01009_B,01009,B,yes it s too mild
p01010_B,01010,B,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister
p01011_B,01011,B,having made which bargain tom we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner time
p01012_B,01012,B,my dear tom let me try to be your banker
p01013_B,01013,B,a very good fellow indeed
p01014_B,01014,B,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p01015_B,01015,B,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p01016_B,01016,B,he did though i mean to say mr harthouse that when i first left home and went to old bounderby s i was as flat as a warming pan and knew no more about life than any oyster does
p01017_B,01017,B,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p01018_B,01018,B,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p01019_B,01019,B,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p01020_B,01020,B,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p01021_B,01021,B,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p01022_B,01022,B,his daughter ah and everybody else why he formed me that way
p01023_B,01023,B,it s it s ridiculously mild where s the door good night
p01024_B,01024,B,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off
p01025_B,01025,B,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p01026_B,01026,B,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p01027_B,01027,B,i will be mr harthouse
p01028_B,01028,B,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p01029_B,01029,B,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no
p01030_B,01030,B,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p01031_B,01031,B,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p01032_B,01032,B,mercenary who is not mercenary ask my sister
p01033_B,01033,B,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p01034_B,01034,B,where why in my own bed at bounderby s
p01035_B,01035,B,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p01036_B,01036,B,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p01037_B,01037,B,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p01038_B,01038,B,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p01039_B,01039,B,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p01040_B,01040,B,i believe you
p01041_B,01041,B,you think so don t you
p01042_B,01042,B,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p01043_B,01043,B,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p01044_B,01044,B,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p01045_B,01045,B,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p01046_B,01046,B,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p01047_B,01047,B,well i must take my leave of you though i say yours is very good tobacco but it s too mild

p01049_B,01049,B,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p01050_B,01050,B,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean

p01052_B,01052,B,oh my friends and fellow men i do not wonder that you the prostrate sons of labour are incredulous of the existence of such a man but he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed and judas iscariot existed and castlereagh existed and this man exists my friends by virtue o my office as your president i askes o our friend slackbridge who may be a little over hetter in this business to take his seat whiles this man stephen blackpool is heern you all know this man stephen blackpool you know him awlung o his misfort ns and his good name

p01154_B,01154,B,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned
p01155_B,01155,B,it wanted this to complete the defeat the defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished only a poor girl only a stroller only james harthouse made nothing of only james harthouse a great pyramid of failure
p01156_B,01156,B,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p01157_B,01157,B,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p01158_B,01158,B,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p01159_B,01159,B,to mr harthouse and you speak to him with the most confiding eyes i ever saw and the most earnest voice though so quiet i ever heard
p01160_B,01160,B,will you oblige me by confiding it
p01161_B,01161,B,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p01162_B,01162,B,at
p01163_B,01163,B,you may i assure you
p01164_B,01164,B,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p01165_B,01165,B,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p01166_B,01166,B,upon my soul i don t know what to say so immensely absurd
p01167_B,01167,B,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p01168_B,01168,B,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p01169_B,01169,B,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p01170_B,01170,B,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p01171_B,01171,B,my name
p01172_B,01172,B,it is still true there is no hope
p01173_B,01173,B,i left her within an hour
p01174_B,01174,B,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p01175_B,01175,B,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p01176_B,01176,B,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p01177_B,01177,B,sissy jupe
p01178_B,01178,B,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p01179_B,01179,B,at her father s
p01180_B,01180,B,yes
p01181_B,01181,B,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p01182_B,01182,B,i have no charge from her
p01183_B,01183,B,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p01184_B,01184,B,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p01185_B,01185,B,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01186_B,01186,B,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01187_B,01187,B,did you offer him a bank note
p01188_B,01188,B,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01189_B,01189,B,what what young lady in the name of mercy was left the poor lad to do the masters against him on one hand the men against him on the other he only wantin to work hard in peace and do what he felt right can a man have no soul of his own no mind of his own must he go wrong all through wi this side or must he go wrong all through wi that or else be hunted like a hare
p01190_B,01190,B,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01191_B,01191,B,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p01192_B,01192,B,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01193_B,01193,B,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01194_B,01194,B,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p01195_B,01195,B,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01196_B,01196,B,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01197_B,01197,B,true
p01198_B,01198,B,i don t know there is a hat lying in the grass
p01199_B,01199,B,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01200_B,01200,B,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p01201_B,01201,B,that is a dreadful thought
p01202_B,01202,B,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go
p01203_B,01203,B,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01204_B,01204,B,is there has the hat any blood upon it rachael i will go on a little by myself
p01205_B,01205,B,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01206_B,01206,B,then i will come next night too
p01207_B,01207,B,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01208_B,01208,B,rachael dear rachael good rachael for the love of heaven not these dreadful cries think of stephen think of stephen think of stephen rachael stephen may be living you wouldn t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place a moment if you could bring help to him
p01209_B,01209,B,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01210_B,01210,B,don t stir from here for his sake let me go and listen rachael we must lose not a moment we must go in different directions seeking aid you shall go by the way we have come and i will go forward by the path tell any one you see and every one what has happened think of stephen think of stephen
p01211_B,01211,B,he d walk the journey in two days if he was footsore and couldn t walk i sent him in the letter he got the money to ride lest he should have none of his own to spare
p01212_B,01212,B,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01213_B,01213,B,but he is in none of them he has been sought for in all and he s not there
p01214_B,01214,B,o the poor lad the poor lad he has been made away with he is lying murdered here
p01215_B,01215,B,what is the matter
p01216_B,01216,B,yes dear
p01217_B,01217,B,o my good lord he s down there down there
p01218_B,01218,B,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01219_B,01219,B,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01220_B,01220,B,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01221_B,01221,B,no no no
p01222_B,01222,B,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01223_B,01223,B,it s mrs pegler
p01224_B,01224,B,i should think it is fetch mr bounderby stand away everybody don t tell me i have told you twenty times coming along that i will not leave you till i have handed you over to him myself
p01225_B,01225,B,my own boy she threatened me that if i resisted her i should be brought by constables and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a such a fine house as this indeed indeed it is not my fault my dear noble stately boy i have always lived quiet and secret josiah my dear i have never broken the condition once i have never said i was your mother i have admired you at a distance and if i have come to town sometimes with long times between to take a proud peep at you i have done it unbeknown my love and gone away again
p01226_B,01226,B,my dear josiah my darling boy i am not to blame it s not my fault josiah i told this lady over and over again that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you but she would do it
p01227_B,01227,B,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p01228_B,01228,B,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p01229_B,01229,B,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p01230_B,01230,B,dear yes dear in his self made prosperity madam i dare say not very dear however when you deserted him in his infancy and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother
p01231_B,01231,B,do you deny then madam that you left your son to to be brought up in the gutter
p01232_B,01232,B,me unnatural me inhuman to my dear boy
p01233_B,01233,B,i deserted my josiah now lord forgive you sir for your wicked imaginations and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother who died in my arms before josiah was born may you repent of it sir and live to know better
p01234_B,01234,B,josiah in the gutter no such a thing sir never for shame on you my dear boy knows and will give you to know that though he come of humble parents he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful and i ve his books at home to show it aye have i and my dear boy knows and will give you to know sir that after his beloved father died when he was eight years old his mother too could pinch a bit as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it to help him out in life and put him prentice and a steady lad he was and a kind master he had to lend him a hand and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving and i ll give you to know sir for this my dear boy won t that though his mother kept but a little village shop he never forgot her but pensioned me on thirty pound a year more than i want for i put by out of it only making the condition that i was to keep down in my own part and make no boasts about him and not trouble him and i never have except with looking at him once a year when he has never knowed it and it s right that i should keep down in my own part and i have no doubts that if i was here i should do a many unbefitting things and i am well contented and i can keep my pride in my josiah to myself and i can love for love s own sake and i am ashamed of you sir for your slanders and suspicions and i never stood here before nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no and i shouldn t be here now if it hadn t been for being brought here and for shame upon you oh for shame to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son with my son standing here to tell you so different
