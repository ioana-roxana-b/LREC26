John Middleton,Marianne,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle,4,3,1,1,7,12,1,1,6,4,1,1,2,5,1,1,6,6,1,1,3,2,1,1,10,17,1,1,7,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,68,85,475,477,Elinor; Marianne; Mrs. Jennings,M,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement,38,0,1,0,66,1,1,1,66,1,1,1,56,1,1,1,72,4,1,1,7,0,1,0,119,5,1,1,86,3,1,1,2,0,1,0,806,24,702,704,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,14,0,1,0,33,4,1,1,25,1,1,1,43,0,1,0,32,1,1,1,5,0,1,0,49,3,1,1,35,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,344,13,876,878,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major

Elinor,Edward Ferrars,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,0,30,0,1,0,41,0,1,0,33,0,1,0,36,0,1,0,22,0,1,0,8,0,1,1,63,1,1,1,60,1,1,0,3,0,1,8,466,919,921,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate

Elinor,Edward Ferrars,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,3,1,1,1,13,7,1,1,16,5,1,1,9,1,1,1,15,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,18,10,1,1,7,7,1,1,4,0,1,0,112,64,924,926,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate
