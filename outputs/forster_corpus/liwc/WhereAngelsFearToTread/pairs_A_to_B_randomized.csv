Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,22,334,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,24,347,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,26,270,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,28,257,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there,on irma why,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,30,323,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her,i got up without saying anything,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,36,251,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,40,29,one moment irma i m going to the station i ll give you the pleasure of my company,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera,Irma; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,248,21,of course we must tell irma,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,250,31,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,252,382,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,263,358,good does the italian get anything,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,265,332,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,267,264,she was so mixed up in the affair,he will get all hers but you know what that is,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,269,317,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,271,37,that is quite true,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,273,274,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean,she did but she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy she saw that i was reticent and she did not press me you see philip i can say to you what i could not say before harriet her ideas are so crude really we do not want it known in sawston that there is a baby all peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,316,396,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks,harriet harriet shall go too harriet now will be invaluable,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,331,266,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,333,19,hopeful indeed,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,337,338,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment,we can but trust to our influence,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,346,262,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians,Caroline Abbott; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,357,386,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,359,329,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to,don t dear and harriet don t be so serious i mean not so serious when you are with irma she will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,361,392,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott,yes going alone would start this evening i offered to write she said it was too late too late the child if you please irma s brother to live with her to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates to go to school like a gentleman she paying oh you re a man it doesn t matter for you you can laugh but i know what people say and that woman goes to italy this evening,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,367,249,certainly he will never suppose that,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,369,360,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,381,362,she fences well,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,383,319,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,385,272,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate
Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,387,268,go where do sit down what s happened,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mr. Herriton,Mrs. Herriton,395,23,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her,Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,intermediate

Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,21,258,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,23,256,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her,i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,25,383,when a man is neither well bred nor well connected nor handsome nor clever nor rich even lilia may discard him in time,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,27,254,my dear boy if possible she has got worse and worse it was your idea of italian travel that saved us,the child must know some time,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,29,30,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,31,22,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,63,32,the man may be a duke or he may be an organ grinder that is not the point if lilia marries him she insults the memory of charles she insults irma she insults us therefore i forbid her and if she disobeys we have done with her for ever,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,249,393,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage,then let her go let her mess with italy by herself she ll come to grief somehow italy s too dangerous too,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,251,333,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her,hopeful indeed,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,253,391,mrs theobald must be told but she doesn t count she is breaking up very quickly she doesn t even see mr kingcroft now he thank goodness i hear has at last consoled himself with someone else,abbott,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,255,316,the later the better every moment she is developing,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,257,322,on irma why,did you let her,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,260,261,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours,it will make a difference in the money surely,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,262,250,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,264,318,he will get all hers but you know what that is,what did you say,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,266,271,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline,that is quite true,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,268,64,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them,i will do all i can,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,270,395,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,272,26,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,315,387,really irma is getting too tiresome she forgot poor lilia soon enough,go where do sit down what s happened,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,317,324,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers,you must have felt just as you did when i wanted to pray for the devil,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,319,267,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it,she was so mixed up in the affair,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,321,359,she asked if she could pray for her new father for the italian,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,323,28,i got up without saying anything,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there,Harriet; Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,330,361,i cannot think what his motive is in sending them,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,332,385,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,334,331,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,336,265,i told her not to but we must watch her carefully without of course appearing to be suspicious,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,358,363,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities,you talk like harriet,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,360,263,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain,good does the italian get anything,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,362,20,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it,and alas alas a look of old mrs theobald what appalling apparition was that i did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile why ever did she come,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,366,252,what do you think of it it would not do to let him know that we are anxious for it,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,368,367,but what effect will the letter have on him,certainly he will never suppose that,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,370,369,dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,382,320,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed,and what happened this morning,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,384,273,isn t it disheartening,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,386,269,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,388,389,she won t accept won t accept the letter as final you must go to monteriano,i won t i ve been and i ve failed i ll never see the place again i hate italy,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,390,371,if you don t go she will,i don t know i m sure but if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted by return you should have sent a little sum to him oh i m not cynical at least i only go by what i know of him but i am weary of the whole show weary of italy weary weary weary sawston s a kind pitiful place isn t it i will go walk in it and seek comfort,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,392,337,yes going alone would start this evening i offered to write she said it was too late too late the child if you please irma s brother to live with her to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates to go to school like a gentleman she paying oh you re a man it doesn t matter for you you can laugh but i know what people say and that woman goes to italy this evening,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mrs. Herriton,Mr. Herriton,394,24,stop that nonsense philip i will not be disgraced by her i will have the child pay all we ve got for it i will have it,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public,Mr. Herriton,F,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,32,775,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable,the baby the baby it slipped it s gone from my arms i stole it,Harriet; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Harriet,428,419,tut tut tutlet you d find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient i heartily dislike the fellow but we know he didn t murder her in that letter though she said a lot she never said he was physically cruel,beauty is the only test at least so you told me when i sketched old buildings for the sake i suppose of making yourself unpleasant,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,430,748,things which one must mention if one s to talk at all and things which one must keep in their proper place because he was unfaithful to his wife it doesn t follow that in every way he s absolutely vile,hush sleeping,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,432,425,oh stow it take it to the back kitchen it s no more a supreme test than anything else the italians never were chivalrous from the first if you condemn him for that you ll condemn the whole lot,you what s the good of cleverness if a man s murdered a woman,Harriet,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Harriet,448,33,harriet are you mad,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,454,399,we shall probably be arrested for brawling harriet have you the very slightest sense of the ludicrous,yes indeed mother has written me a really beautiful letter she describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings how she has tried by letter and it is no good nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back then she says there is nothing like personal influence you and philip will succeed where i have failed she says too that caroline abbott has been wonderful caroline feels it as keenly almost as us that is because she knows the man oh he must be loathsome goodness me i ve forgotten to pack the ammonia it has been a terrible lesson for caroline but i fancy it is her turning point i can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,521,409,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby,so mother told me for goodness sake get the tickets here comes that hot woman again she has the impudence to bow,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,525,744,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man,i heard you coming,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,527,413,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre,what do they do there,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,530,763,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous,oh the night air i suppose or perhaps the wet of the rain,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,532,531,but this is an opera lucia di lammermoor sir walter scott classical you know,mother wouldn t like it it would be most unsuitable almost irreverent besides all that foreign theatres are notorious don t you remember those letters in the church family newspaper,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,543,445,shut it,we ve come here to get the baby back and for nothing else i ll not have this levity and slackness and talk about pictures and churches think of mother did she send you out for them,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Harriet,658,431,you mustn t accuse her of that though she is exasperating she hasn t come here to betray us,it s the supreme test the man who is unchivalrous to a woman,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,660,528,i ve not got the baby harriet but at the same time i haven t exactly failed i and signor carella are to have another interview this afternoon at the caffe garibaldi he is perfectly reasonable and pleasant should you be disposed to come with me you would find him quite willing to discuss things he is desperately in want of money and has no prospect of getting any i discovered that at the same time he has a certain affection for the child miss abbott has behaved extraordinarily but at the same time harriet you must listen my dear you must stop crying i have something quite important to say,theatres here and at such a moment,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,662,659,remember that miss abbott has done us no harm she said nothing to him about the matter he assumes that she is working with us i gathered that,then why has she come here answer me that bursting in on me crying and looking a disgusting sight and says she has been to see the italian couldn t even talk properly pretended she had changed her opinions what are her opinions to us i was very calm i said miss abbott i think there is a little misapprehension in this matter my mother mrs herriton oh goodness my head of course you ve failed don t trouble to answer i know you ve failed where s the baby pray of course you haven t got it dear sweet caroline won t let you oh yes and we re to go away at once and trouble the father no more those are her commands commands commands,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,664,447,yes but if you re careful she may be i interpret her behaviour thus she went to see him honestly intending to get the child away in the note she left me she says so and i don t believe she d lie,i shan t,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,666,533,when she got there there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism before very long if i know anything about psychology there will be a reaction she ll be swept back,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,668,665,when she s swept back she ll be invaluable for she has made quite an impression on him he thinks her so nice with the baby you know she washed it for him,i do,Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Harriet,670,403,if you want to carry off the baby keep your peace with miss abbott for if she chooses she can help you better than i can,a single for me i shall never get back alive,Harriet,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,284,301,let us rather say unhappily expressed,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,286,852,and the telegram,that i love him,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,288,105,did you really mean to stop,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,294,277,but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,302,307,why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent,i hope you see why i have troubled you with this long story women i heard you say the other day are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad all through me you see mr herriton it makes me specially unhappy it s the only time i ve ever gone into what my father calls real life and look what i ve made of it all that winter i seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and i don t know what and when the spring came i wanted to fight against the things i hated mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society i actually hated society for a day or two at monteriano i didn t see that all these things are invincible and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces thank you for listening to so much nonsense,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,304,860,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position,oh you shall know quick enough,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,306,500,oh i don t think that,i know what he has done what he says and what he thinks is of very little importance,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,308,830,oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you,sawston and work,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,351,808,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest,he has no heart he does not really mind about the child at all,Caroline Abbott; Mrs. Herriton,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,373,502,there are sure to be incidental expenses do you suppose we shall have difficulty with the man,oh no not that i never told him that you and harriet were coming you could have taken him by surprise if you liked he only asked for you and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago,Caroline Abbott; Mr. Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,375,109,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent,i ll tell you not another word,Caroline Abbott; Mr. Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,377,89,well what do you conclude from that,one would never believe it he looks much older,Caroline Abbott; Mr. Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,379,472,yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children look at rodrigo borgia for example,i should be grateful you see harriet knows nothing,Caroline Abbott; Mr. Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,471,695,i was going to make myself some tea,it will come to nothing well,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,475,565,he was out you find me as ignorant as you have left harriet,i suppose you didn t settle anything,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,477,719,pray let us start clear permit me to begin by asking you a question in which capacity have you come to monteriano spy or traitor,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,479,374,it is hopeless to expect you to believe me but i can assert that we are here to get the child even if it costs us all we ve got my mother has fixed no money limit whatever i am here to carry out her instructions i think that you will approve of them as you have practically dictated them i do not approve of them they are absurd harriet also carries out your instructions she however approves of them and does not know that they proceed from you i think miss abbott you had better take entire charge of the rescue party i have asked for an interview with signor carella tomorrow morning do you acquiesce might i ask for details of your interview with him they might be helpful to me,it depends,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,481,380,from perfetta if it interests you,i have also seen examples of that in my district,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,493,818,and of what did you talk,because i understand the place there is no need,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,495,494,my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower,the weather there will be rain he says by tomorrow evening the other towns england myself about you a little and he actually mentioned lilia he was perfectly disgusting he pretended he loved her he offered to show me her grave the grave of the woman he has murdered,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,497,107,harriet would say he has no sense of sin,stop i ll tell you no more,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,505,305,i lost my temper did he really what exactly did he say,we were mad drunk with rebellion we had no common sense as soon as you came you saw and foresaw everything,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,507,685,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset,i can do no more but i tell you plainly i have changed sides,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,509,378,the view from the rocca wasn t it fine,that he is a thoroughly wicked man,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,511,69,because harriet,a short time quite a short time,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,513,490,it reaches up to heaven and down to the other place is it to be a symbol of the town,so i went up in the evening for the sunset i had nothing to do he was in the garden it belongs to a friend of his,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,517,79,why yes these people know how to live they would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all that is why they have got to have so much that is good however bad the performance is tonight it will be alive italians don t love music silently like the beastly germans the audience takes its share sometimes more,it was a mistake of mrs theobald s,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,534,283,good miss abbott you are coming too,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,566,97,why no how could i the fact is well i got taken by surprise but after all what does it matter there s no earthly reason why we shouldn t do the business pleasantly he s a perfectly charming person and so are his friends i m his friend now his long lost brother what s the harm i tell you miss abbott it s one thing for england and another for italy there we plan and get on high moral horses here we find what asses we are for things go off quite easily all by themselves my hat what a night did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before well as i was saying it s absurd to worry he s not a porky father he wants that baby as little as i do he s been ragging my dear mother just as he ragged me eighteen months ago and i ve forgiven him oh but he has a sense of humour,i suppose so there is general conscription he was in the bersaglieri i think isn t that the crack regiment,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,678,103,and please believe that i have not come to scold you i know what has happened,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,680,147,what might have happened to me he had made you believe that he loved the child,i can t stop here i daren t stop here you will have to take me with you,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,682,87,at present it is still unsettled,oh quite young twenty one i believe,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,684,498,perhaps not well as i said i know what has happened and i am not here to scold you but i must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present harriet is furious but she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm and will do none,harriet may be right i am afraid,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,686,705,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella,i wish something would happen to you my dear friend i wish something would happen to you,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,688,681,quite nice wasn t he,oh yes he has he will never give it up,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,692,535,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,694,73,do this afternoon i have another interview,close on three weeks,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,696,352,then another if that fails i shall wire home for instructions i dare say we may fail altogether but we shall fail honourably,the child came into the world through my negligence it is natural i should take an interest in it,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,698,683,why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns,it will never be settled,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,700,299,because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,702,285,you are wonderful,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,704,701,miss abbott don t worry over me some people are born not to do things i m one of them i never did anything at school or at the bar i came out to stop lilia s marriage and it was too late i came out intending to get the baby and i shall return an honourable failure i never expect anything to happen now and so i am never disappointed you would be surprised to know what my great events are going to the theatre yesterday talking to you now i don t suppose i shall ever meet anything greater i seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it and i m sure i can t tell you whether the fate s good or evil i don t die i don t fall in love and if other people die or fall in love they always do it when i m just not there you are quite right life to me is just a spectacle which thank god and thank italy and thank you is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,712,486,you going,mr herriton how could you believe her do you suppose that i would have entered that man s house knowing about him all that i do i think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady i hear you wanted harriet to go very properly she refused eighteen months ago i might have done such a thing but i trust i have learnt how to behave by now,Caroline Abbott; Harriet,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,716,81,well i suppose i shall and i shall also have my interview with signor carella but why should you mind do you suppose that i shall have the slightest influence over him,carella,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,718,478,perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it,spy spy your mother has behaved dishonourably all through she never wanted the child no harm in that but she is too proud to let it come to me she has done all she could to wreck things she did not tell you everything she has told harriet nothing at all she has lied or acted lies everywhere i cannot trust your mother so i have come here alone all across europe no one knows it my father thinks i am in normandy to spy on mrs herriton don t let s argue if you are here to get the child i will help you if you are here to fail i shall get it instead of you,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,727,504,yes do now that we have quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the hill well good bye it s all over at last another scene in my pageant has shifted,you did not think it a little thing at the time you told me he had assaulted you,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,729,844,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious,all the wonderful things are over that is just where it is,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,803,826,he will have to marry her i heard from him this morning just as we left milan he finds he has gone too far to back out it would be expensive i don t know how much he minds not as much as we suppose i think at all events there s not a word of blame in the letter i don t believe he even feels angry i never was so completely forgiven ever since you stopped him killing me it has been a vision of perfect friendship he nursed me he lied for me at the inquest and at the funeral though he was crying you would have thought it was my son who had died certainly i was the only person he had to be kind to he was so distressed not to make harriet s acquaintance and that he scarcely saw anything of you in his letter he says so again,poor harriet as if i dare judge harriet or anybody,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,805,866,indeed i will,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,807,309,i hope next spring perhaps we shall paint siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money it was one of the arguments for marrying her,i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,809,699,no you re wrong he does he is unhappy like the rest of us but he doesn t try to keep up appearances as we do he knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,811,71,in his passion not when he was calm we english say it when we are calm when we do not really believe it any longer gino is not ashamed of inconsistency it is one of the many things i like him for,exactly eleven days,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,813,516,he s much more honest with himself than i am and he is honest without an effort and without pride but you miss abbott what about you will you be in italy next spring,but is there an opera right up here,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,815,492,i m sorry when will you come back do you think,it was very awkward for me but i had to talk he seemed to make me you see he thought i was here as a tourist he thinks so still he intended to be civil and i judged it better to be civil also,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,817,480,for whatever reason,my interview how do you know of it,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,819,518,understand italy,can t we go,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,823,691,yes i can t live at sawston,why aren t you angry with me,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,825,836,i wrote from monteriano i tried to explain things but she will never understand me her view will be that the affair is settled sadly settled since the baby is dead still it s over our family circle need be vexed no more she won t even be angry with you you see you have done us no harm in the long run unless of course you talk about harriet and make a scandal so that is my plan london and work what is yours,of course we shall meet whenever you come down and i hope that it will mean often,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,827,303,is harriet going to be all right,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,829,687,i m clear enough about harriet s future and about parts of my own but i ask again what about yours,oh certainly i don t want to speak to him again i shan t ever see him again,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,831,856,no,yes pull it to pieces tell me i m a fool or worse that he s a cad say all you said when lilia fell in love with him that s the help i want i dare tell you this because i like you and because you re without passion you look on life as a spectacle you don t enter it you only find it funny or beautiful so i can trust you to cure me mr herriton isn t it funny he s not a gentleman nor a christian nor good in any way he s never flattered me nor honoured me but because he s handsome that s been enough the son of an italian dentist with a pretty face oh mr herriton isn t it funny i love him and i m not ashamed of it i love him and i m going to sawston and if i mayn t speak about him to you sometimes i shall die,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,833,281,you ve seen too much you ve seen as much and done more than i have,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,835,846,silly nonsense you re too good about a thousand times better than i am you can t live in that hole you must go among people who can hope to understand you i mind for myself i want to see you often again and again,the wonderful things are over,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major
Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,837,474,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough,but what s that to do with it,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major

Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,91,292,very good looking all his features are good and he is well built though i dare say english standards would find him too short,i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,93,84,as far as i have seen him i do as far as i have seen him i do like him,perhaps i bore you with these questions if so i will stop,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major

Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,101,692,meanwhile like most young men he lives with his people father mother two sisters and a tiny tot of a brother,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,103,487,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven,i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,105,511,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist,because harriet,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,107,499,stop i ll tell you no more,if so perhaps he isn t sinful,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,275,507,it is all so strange as well as so tragic and what i did was as strange as anything,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,277,686,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,279,837,the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,281,861,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy,but before you retire to sawston are you so mighty sure,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,283,290,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude,would that have suited a newly married pair,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,285,821,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all,well i don t and i don t understand you,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,287,827,ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you,is harriet going to be all right,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,289,296,for a time at all events,oh never mind,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,291,375,it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,293,106,well i have explained,i cannot think what is in the air if lilia was determined to disgrace us she might have found a less repulsive way a boy of medium height with a pretty face the son of a dentist at monteriano have i put it correctly may i surmise that he has not got one penny may i also surmise that his social position is nil furthermore,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,295,304,an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,297,817,i hated sawston you see,for whatever reason,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,299,280,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness,yes we counted on you,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,301,86,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano,then how old is he,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,303,847,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now,miss abbott what is the matter with you i thought i understood you and i don t all those two great first days at monteriano i read you as clearly as you read me still i saw why you had come and why you changed sides and afterwards i saw your wonderful courage and pity and now you re frank with me one moment as you used to be and the next moment you shut me up you see i owe too much to you my life and i don t know what besides i won t stand it you ve gone too far to turn mysterious i ll quote what you said to me don t be mysterious there isn t the time i ll quote something else i and my life must be where i live you can t live at sawston,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major

Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,697,74,that s not doing anything you would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby or if you went straight away but that to fail honourably to come out of the thing as well as you can is that all you are after,did you know him before you came,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,699,351,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,701,680,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair,what might have happened to me he had made you believe that he loved the child,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major

Caroline Abbott,Mr. Herriton,719,82,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever,carella conte or marchese or what,Mr. Herriton,F,major,M,major
