Q1186,the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']

Q1189,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']
Q1190,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1191,godbole,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']

Q1194,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']
Q1195,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1196,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']
Q1197,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1198,i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1199,it was performed by the guide,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1200,it was performed by you,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1201,it was performed by me,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1202,and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1203,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']
Q1204,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1205,you re preaching that evil and good are the same,Cyril Fielding,['Professor Godbole']
Q1206,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1207,but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1208,did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground,Professor Godbole,['Cyril Fielding']

Q1620,not much,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']

Q1623,that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1624,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1625,one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1626,perhaps,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1627,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1628,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1629,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1630,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1631,you put it honestly anyhow,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1632,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']

Q1638,how can that be,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1639,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1640,my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1641,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1642,i don t go to that length,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1643,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1644,she s an old lady,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1645,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1646,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1647,because the dead don t live again,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1648,i fear not,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']

Q1650,what does dr aziz say of me,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1651,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1652,but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1653,the guide,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1654,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']
Q1655,perhaps it was the guide,Adela Quested,['Cyril Fielding']
Q1656,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district,Cyril Fielding,['Adela Quested']

Q1663,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1664,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1665,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to,Adela Quested,"['Hamidullah', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1666,all it amounts to indeed,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1667,speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1668,not at all we were only discussing possibilities,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1669,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"

Q1674,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1675,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1676,they might equally attack the dak bungalow,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1677,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1678,quite so i have given trouble enough,Adela Quested,"['Hamidullah', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1679,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1680,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1681,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her,Hamidullah,"['Adela Quested', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1682,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"
Q1683,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again,Adela Quested,"['Hamidullah', 'Cyril Fielding']"
Q1684,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman,Cyril Fielding,"['Adela Quested', 'Hamidullah']"

Q1695,does he tell me to come out to him,Adela Quested,"['Hamidullah', 'Cyril Fielding']"
