00162,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,447,1312,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00163,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,449,448,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say,father do you think i love mr bounderby,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
00164,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,451,1241,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00165,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,453,424,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question,yes father,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00166,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,455,36,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced,yes father,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00167,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,457,426,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears,yes father,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00168,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,459,480,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00169,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,461,1308,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
00170,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,463,474,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00171,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,465,1038,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00172,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,467,456,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact,what would you advise me to use in its stead father,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00173,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,469,1046,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00177,Thomas Gradgrind,Louisa Bounderby,477,1314,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town,Louisa Bounderby,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
