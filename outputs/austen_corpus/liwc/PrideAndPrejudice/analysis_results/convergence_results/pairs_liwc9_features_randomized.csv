00148,Jane,Elizabeth,370,1109,laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no,you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00157,Jane,Elizabeth,474,843,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself,oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
00158,Jane,Elizabeth,476,60,but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere,did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00160,Jane,Elizabeth,480,709,but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00161,Jane,Elizabeth,499,919,oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before you doubt me indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself,oh certainly we will ask you no questions,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0
00162,Jane,Elizabeth,501,964,my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin,i wish i could say any thing to comfort you but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00163,Jane,Elizabeth,503,473,i must think your language too strong in speaking of both and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00164,Jane,Elizabeth,505,699,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00165,Jane,Elizabeth,507,477,and do you impute it to either of those,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00166,Jane,Elizabeth,509,500,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00168,Jane,Elizabeth,698,371,his being so sure of succeeding was wrong and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00171,Jane,Elizabeth,704,705,i do not know when i have been more shocked wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00172,Jane,Elizabeth,706,1107,poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00174,Jane,Elizabeth,710,475,lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now,that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00175,Jane,Elizabeth,712,481,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved,it keeps him in good humour and i am more obliged to you than i can express,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

00177,Jane,Elizabeth,716,506,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00178,Jane,Elizabeth,821,418,not yet but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well,i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00180,Jane,Elizabeth,825,467,we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00182,Jane,Elizabeth,834,369,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00183,Jane,Elizabeth,836,998,yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before,and this is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00184,Jane,Elizabeth,838,835,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0

00186,Jane,Elizabeth,842,1007,i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false,that is the most unforgiving speech that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00187,Jane,Elizabeth,844,715,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00189,Jane,Elizabeth,848,707,i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1
00190,Jane,Elizabeth,850,504,i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties,and men take care that they should,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00191,Jane,Elizabeth,852,713,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00193,Jane,Elizabeth,877,703,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse,Elizabeth; Mr. Bennet,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00194,Jane,Elizabeth,893,717,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds,and then if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00195,Jane,Elizabeth,895,837,we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

00206,Jane,Elizabeth,1006,853,it must have been his sister s doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00218,Elizabeth,Jane,64,716,i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his,you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00219,Elizabeth,Jane,369,850,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody,i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00220,Elizabeth,Jane,371,1008,i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks,would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00221,Elizabeth,Jane,412,505,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon,if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00222,Elizabeth,Jane,414,844,mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself,perhaps it would have been better but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00223,Elizabeth,Jane,416,1110,this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living,good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00224,Elizabeth,Jane,467,476,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them,but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00225,Elizabeth,Jane,469,706,it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should,poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00226,Elizabeth,Jane,471,708,yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it,i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00227,Elizabeth,Jane,473,1108,you shall have it in few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend,oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
00228,Elizabeth,Jane,475,700,that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer,blame you oh no,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0
00229,Elizabeth,Jane,477,472,you must decide for yourself and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him,most willingly,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
00230,Elizabeth,Jane,479,59,i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion,i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
00231,Elizabeth,Jane,500,372,my dear jane you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve nay this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable,it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1
00232,Elizabeth,Jane,502,470,to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness,why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00233,Elizabeth,Jane,504,714,and men take care that they should,surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00234,Elizabeth,Jane,506,417,i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business,he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00235,Elizabeth,Jane,508,474,yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can,if we thought alike of miss bingley your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00236,Elizabeth,Jane,510,852,yes in conjunction with his friend,mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00237,Elizabeth,Jane,512,1112,your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride,very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00238,Elizabeth,Jane,699,1006,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him,it must have been his sister s doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00239,Elizabeth,Jane,701,511,but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham,i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00240,Elizabeth,Jane,703,61,but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day this will not do you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you chuse,dear lizzy,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
00241,Elizabeth,Jane,705,413,oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather,no i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00242,Elizabeth,Jane,707,988,there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it,but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00243,Elizabeth,Jane,709,712,and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty,how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00244,Elizabeth,Jane,711,1114,indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you,what do you mean,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
00245,Elizabeth,Jane,713,838,certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character,how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00246,Elizabeth,Jane,715,893,that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00248,Elizabeth,Jane,824,834,and have you heard from him often,colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00249,Elizabeth,Jane,826,846,and my mother how is she how are you all,he brought it with him for us to see,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00250,Elizabeth,Jane,833,509,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever,you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00251,Elizabeth,Jane,835,1116,and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself,my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1
00252,Elizabeth,Jane,837,65,and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married,certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

00257,Elizabeth,Jane,847,478,oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it,how can you talk so you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00264,Elizabeth,Jane,894,881,if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

00268,Elizabeth,Jane,1005,513,i suspected as much but how did he account for it,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00276,Elizabeth,Jane,1117,854,it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley,he meant i believe to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this,Jane,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00277,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,66,69,you began the evening well charlotte you were mr bingley s first choice,perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00279,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,70,86,upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00312,Elizabeth,Charlotte Lucas,587,90,i am not one and twenty,perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses,Charlotte Lucas; Lady Catherine De Bourgh; Maria; Miss De Bourgh; Mrs. Jenkinson,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00314,Charlotte Lucas,Elizabeth,86,538,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

00331,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,189,1081,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00337,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,255,1145,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00346,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,379,1089,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00347,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,381,1147,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00348,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,383,663,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

00353,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,396,665,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
00354,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,398,1085,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00355,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,400,391,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first,what think you of books,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00356,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,402,293,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00357,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,404,1139,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
00358,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,406,380,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00359,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,595,403,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,and what is your success,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00360,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,597,386,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
00361,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,600,1105,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00362,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,602,254,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
00363,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,607,1091,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00364,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,610,795,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00365,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,612,295,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again,and yours is wilfully to misunderstand them,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
00366,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,614,1133,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00367,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,616,384,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0
00368,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,618,291,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00369,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,620,395,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00370,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,622,284,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
00371,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,624,793,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
00372,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,658,286,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00373,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,660,99,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0
00374,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,662,243,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
00375,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,664,659,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00376,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,666,211,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00377,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,668,623,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00378,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,777,288,for your housekeeper informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation,Mr. Darcy; Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
00379,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,790,982,i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose,mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
00380,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,792,611,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now,perfectly so i thank you,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00381,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,794,405,oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00382,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,796,598,my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake,i am not afraid of you,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00383,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,979,393,is your sister at pemberley still,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00384,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,981,608,and quite alone have all her friends left her,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00385,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1074,619,mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00386,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1076,797,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00387,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1078,407,yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
00388,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1080,613,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00389,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1082,625,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way,you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn are you pleased with kent,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
00390,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1084,256,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00391,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1086,778,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00392,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1088,1087,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00393,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1090,1077,had you then persuaded yourself that i should,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00394,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1092,1143,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,a man who had felt less might,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1
00395,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1094,621,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00396,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1096,194,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00397,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1098,1099,i must ask whether you were surprised,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00398,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1100,1075,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00399,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1102,791,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00400,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1104,1101,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00401,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1132,615,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00402,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1134,401,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,may i ask to what these questions tend,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00403,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1136,667,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00404,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1138,603,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
00405,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1140,1137,but i was embarrassed,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00406,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1142,669,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00407,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1144,1079,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00408,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1146,382,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00409,Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,1148,1097,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00410,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,99,1138,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic,dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00411,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,192,1082,all this she must possess and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading,i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00412,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,194,1096,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this,your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00413,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,211,1080,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society,we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Miss Bingley; Mrs. Bennet,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00414,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,221,1078,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Bennet,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00415,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,247,1104,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month,and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
00416,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,252,1142,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety,you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
00417,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,254,400,to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either,it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00418,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,261,262,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel,oh i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00419,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,270,222,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00420,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,284,1094,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00421,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,286,271,perhaps that is not possible for any one but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00422,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,291,1148,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00423,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,293,666,there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome,and of your infliction you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00424,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,380,1150,do you talk by rule then while you are dancing,and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00425,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,382,670,are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine,this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood how despicably have i acted i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00426,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,384,193,this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
00427,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,386,402,mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain,merely to the illustration of your character i am trying to make it out,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0
00428,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,389,612,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of,i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00429,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,391,1084,what think you of books,oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00430,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,393,1146,i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions,lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00431,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,395,381,the present always occupies you in such scenes does it,sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00432,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,397,406,i am,but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
00433,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,399,385,i hope not,i must not decide on my own performance when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00434,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,401,392,may i ask to what these questions tend,books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00435,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,403,624,and what is your success,i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00436,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,405,253,i can readily believe that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
00437,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,596,1092,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00438,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,601,668,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party,you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00439,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,603,604,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00440,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,606,1140,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done,but i was embarrassed,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
00441,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,611,1076,perfectly so i thank you,you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00442,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,613,383,i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing,both for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00443,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,615,390,i should not be surprised if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00444,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,617,294,mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
00445,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,619,398,it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends,and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00446,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,621,285,and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance,certainly there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00447,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,623,792,it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far,no i thank you there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever when i consider that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00448,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,657,287,in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you,such as vanity and pride,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
00449,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,659,100,and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance,you are severe on us,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0
00450,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,661,248,i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00451,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,663,1102,you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns,did you speak from your own observation when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
00452,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,665,662,his misfortunes yes his misfortunes have been great indeed,but it is not merely this affair on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00453,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,667,292,and this is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own,that is a failing indeed implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00454,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,669,1134,you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter,my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00455,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,791,618,good god what is the matter i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill,yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00456,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,793,597,i am grieved indeed grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00457,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,795,607,and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00458,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,797,396,i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day,yes always i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00459,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,980,616,yes she will remain there till christmas,i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
00460,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1075,658,i am sorry exceedingly sorry that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted,in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00461,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1077,602,if you will thank me let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever it taught me to hope as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly,true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00462,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1079,620,what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence,an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1
00463,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1081,664,i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice,who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0
00464,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1083,255,i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00465,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1085,798,did it did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents i knew that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me,oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00466,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1087,1088,when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit,the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00467,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1089,1144,i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased,how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00468,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1091,1098,indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses,i must ask whether you were surprised,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
00469,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1093,1100,hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction,that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
00470,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1095,660,no indeed i felt nothing but surprise,i might as well enquire why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind can you deny that you have done it,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00471,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1097,394,my object then was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you,no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00472,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1099,195,not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00473,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1101,212,on the evening before my going to london i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together,but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00474,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1103,1086,from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection,the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00475,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1133,981,i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun,and quite alone have all her friends left her,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
00476,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1135,622,for the liveliness of your mind i did,i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00477,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1137,404,was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield,i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
00478,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1139,794,because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement,oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00479,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1141,614,and so was i,if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00480,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1143,796,a man who had felt less might,my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00481,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1145,1090,you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing,had you then persuaded yourself that i should,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
00482,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1147,387,my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00483,Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,1149,1136,i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly,you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00484,Sir William Lucas,Mr. Darcy,103,106,what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies,you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir,Mr. Darcy,M,minor,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

00698,Elizabeth,George Wickham,345,346,but what can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly,a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00701,Elizabeth,George Wickham,351,354,how strange how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it,yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00707,Elizabeth,George Wickham,364,744,no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday,you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00708,Elizabeth,George Wickham,366,944,mr collins speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman,you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00709,Elizabeth,George Wickham,737,360,nearly three weeks,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00712,Elizabeth,George Wickham,743,363,oh no in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy,George Wickham,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

00759,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,420,434,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy,i am not now to learn that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,Charlotte Lucas; Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00760,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,433,438,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them,when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00761,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,435,440,upon my word sir your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00762,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,437,421,indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled,indeed i am i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00763,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,439,436,really mr collins you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one,were it certain that lady catherine would think so but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00764,Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,441,442,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart,you are uniformly charming and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable,Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00765,Mrs. Bennet,Mrs. Gardiner,517,518,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00766,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,518,529,it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent,well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00767,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,520,814,but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00768,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,522,816,oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything i hope that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00769,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,524,800,so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with the sister she will not be able to help calling,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
00770,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,526,747,you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father,and of this place i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00771,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,528,541,yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00772,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,530,533,elizabeth you are not serious now,as i did the other day very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00773,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,532,547,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him,a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00776,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,544,820,but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune,not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00782,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,770,519,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00783,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,772,521,that is not very likely our authority was too good,i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00784,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,799,545,but what is to be done about pemberley john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so,no why should he if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00806,Elizabeth,Mrs. Gardiner,812,532,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00980,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,803,812,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00981,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,807,804,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,do you really think so,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00982,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,809,808,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00983,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,811,810,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00984,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,806,807,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00985,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,808,809,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00986,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,810,811,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00987,Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Gardiner,829,830,if i had been able to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,Elizabeth; Jane; Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00988,Mr. Gardiner,Mrs. Bennet,830,831,do not give way to useless alarm though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all,Elizabeth; Mrs. Bennet; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00989,Mary,Elizabeth,832,833,this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever,Elizabeth,F,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
