p00000_A,00000,A,they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you
p00001_A,00001,A,ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
p00002_A,00002,A,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two
p00003_A,00003,A,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00004_A,00004,A,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00005_A,00005,A,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day
p00006_A,00006,A,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00007_A,00007,A,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00008_A,00008,A,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00009_A,00009,A,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that
p00010_A,00010,A,a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
p00011_A,00011,A,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00012_A,00012,A,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00013_A,00013,A,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you
p00014_A,00014,A,oh dear no never
p00015_A,00015,A,by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party
p00016_A,00016,A,miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not
p00017_A,00017,A,you have made her too tall emma
p00018_A,00018,A,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed
p00019_A,00019,A,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00020_A,00020,A,but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear
p00021_A,00021,A,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness
p00022_A,00022,A,i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey
p00023_A,00023,A,thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you
p00024_A,00024,A,i do not offer it for miss smith s collection being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it
p00025_A,00025,A,take it it is for you take your own
p00026_A,00026,A,oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please
p00027_A,00027,A,ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john
p00028_A,00028,A,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00029_A,00029,A,well i cannot understand it
p00030_A,00030,A,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life
p00031_A,00031,A,oh dear yes
p00032_A,00032,A,oh yes sir how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir
p00033_A,00033,A,pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably
p00034_A,00034,A,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00035_A,00035,A,very much to the honour of both
p00036_A,00036,A,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00037_A,00037,A,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00038_A,00038,A,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00039_A,00039,A,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00040_A,00040,A,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00041_A,00041,A,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00042_A,00042,A,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00043_A,00043,A,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not
p00044_A,00044,A,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes
p00045_A,00045,A,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly
p00046_A,00046,A,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00047_A,00047,A,ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me
p00048_A,00048,A,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing
p00049_A,00049,A,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once
p00050_A,00050,A,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00051_A,00051,A,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august
p00052_A,00052,A,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to
p00053_A,00053,A,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00054_A,00054,A,middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well
p00055_A,00055,A,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00056_A,00056,A,my dear isabella pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse
p00057_A,00057,A,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00058_A,00058,A,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty
p00059_A,00059,A,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure
p00060_A,00060,A,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion
p00061_A,00061,A,very cold certainly very cold
p00062_A,00062,A,you do quite right we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston
p00063_A,00063,A,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day
p00064_A,00064,A,indeed i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment
p00065_A,00065,A,my son frank my son
p00066_A,00066,A,yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper
p00067_A,00067,A,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00068_A,00068,A,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him
p00069_A,00069,A,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them
p00070_A,00070,A,this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow
p00071_A,00071,A,i admired your resolution very much sir in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight
p00072_A,00072,A,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00073_A,00073,A,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses
p00074_A,00074,A,shall i ring the bell
p00075_A,00075,A,never madam never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received
p00076_A,00076,A,mr elton is so good to the poor
p00077_A,00077,A,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00078_A,00078,A,thank you you are so kind oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here you are extremely kind you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting
p00079_A,00079,A,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her
p00080_A,00080,A,a very pleasant evening particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence
p00081_A,00081,A,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield
p00082_A,00082,A,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00083_A,00083,A,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained
p00084_A,00084,A,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00085_A,00085,A,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax
p00086_A,00086,A,my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like
p00087_A,00087,A,that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome
p00088_A,00088,A,i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly
p00089_A,00089,A,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00090_A,00090,A,oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well
p00091_A,00091,A,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00092_A,00092,A,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00093_A,00093,A,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00094_A,00094,A,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00095_A,00095,A,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00096_A,00096,A,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00097_A,00097,A,as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins
p00098_A,00098,A,well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you
p00099_A,00099,A,think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock
p00100_A,00100,A,four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three
p00101_A,00101,A,i told you yesterday i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs
p00102_A,00102,A,it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing
p00103_A,00103,A,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00104_A,00104,A,there is no necessity for my calling this morning another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which
p00105_A,00105,A,oh go to day go to day do not defer it what is right to be done cannot be done too soon and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on if you do not call early it will be a slight
p00106_A,00106,A,yes
p00107_A,00107,A,if you were never particularly struck by her manners before i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue
p00108_A,00108,A,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00109_A,00109,A,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street
p00110_A,00110,A,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00111_A,00111,A,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be
p00112_A,00112,A,yes i believe i do
p00113_A,00113,A,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00114_A,00114,A,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person
p00115_A,00115,A,of course it must be declined
p00116_A,00116,A,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00117_A,00117,A,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00118_A,00118,A,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years
p00119_A,00119,A,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends
p00120_A,00120,A,nonsensical girl
p00121_A,00121,A,one can suppose nothing else and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening
p00122_A,00122,A,thank you for rousing me i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours
p00123_A,00123,A,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner
p00124_A,00124,A,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given
p00125_A,00125,A,i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second
p00126_A,00126,A,perhaps it is as well i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours
p00127_A,00127,A,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased
p00128_A,00128,A,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood
p00129_A,00129,A,should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am
p00130_A,00130,A,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00131_A,00131,A,no trouble in the world ma am
p00132_A,00132,A,aye that will be much best i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s
p00133_A,00133,A,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00134_A,00134,A,what was i talking of i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill said he which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could said he i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some said he directly that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock said he so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning
p00135_A,00135,A,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00136_A,00136,A,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture
p00137_A,00137,A,what is the matter now
p00138_A,00138,A,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing
p00139_A,00139,A,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00140_A,00140,A,oh no it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man
p00141_A,00141,A,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room
p00142_A,00142,A,there is no denying it i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well
p00143_A,00143,A,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement
p00144_A,00144,A,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done
p00145_A,00145,A,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited
p00146_A,00146,A,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00147_A,00147,A,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00148_A,00148,A,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00149_A,00149,A,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00150_A,00150,A,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs
p00151_A,00151,A,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00152_A,00152,A,well if you please if you think she will be of any use
p00153_A,00153,A,oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure
p00154_A,00154,A,it was time to go
p00155_A,00155,A,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck
p00156_A,00156,A,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been
p00157_A,00157,A,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful
p00158_A,00158,A,and who do you think came in while we were there knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man
p00159_A,00159,A,we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to
p00160_A,00160,A,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her
p00161_A,00161,A,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00162_A,00162,A,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00163_A,00163,A,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond
p00164_A,00164,A,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me
p00165_A,00165,A,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have
p00166_A,00166,A,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again
p00167_A,00167,A,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder
p00168_A,00168,A,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart
p00169_A,00169,A,yes there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest
p00170_A,00170,A,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00171_A,00171,A,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00172_A,00172,A,he chose to say he was employed
p00173_A,00173,A,must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way
p00174_A,00174,A,read it read it it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way
p00175_A,00175,A,difference no indeed i am not
p00176_A,00176,A,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home
p00177_A,00177,A,but miss bates and miss fairfax we thought you were to bring them
p00178_A,00178,A,i will see that there are umbrellas sir miss bates must not be forgotten
p00179_A,00179,A,so very obliging of you no rain at all nothing to signify i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares well well this is brilliant indeed this is admirable excellently contrived upon my word nothing wanting could not have imagined it so well lighted up jane jane look did you ever see any thing oh mr weston you must really have had aladdin s lamp good mrs stokes would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in she was standing in the entrance said i but i had not time for more very well i thank you ma am i hope you are quite well very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have delighted to hear it indeed ah dear mrs elton so obliged to you for the carriage excellent time jane and i quite ready did not keep the horses a moment most comfortable carriage oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been but two such offers in one day never were such neighbours i said to my mother thank you my mother is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse s i made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl mrs dixon s wedding present so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know mr dixon s choice there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet it was but a drop or two but i am so afraid but mr frank churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon i shall never forget his extreme politeness oh mr frank churchill i must tell you my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again my mother often talks of your good nature does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill ah here s miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse how do you do very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy land such a transformation must not compliment i know that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look how do you like jane s hair you are a judge she did it all herself quite wonderful how she does her hair no hairdresser from london i think could ah dr hughes i declare and mrs hughes must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for a moment how do you do how do you do very well i thank you this is delightful is not it where s dear mr richard oh there he is don t disturb him much better employed talking to the young ladies how do you do mr richard i saw you the other day as you rode through the town mrs otway i protest and good mr otway and miss otway and miss caroline such a host of friends and mr george and mr arthur how do you do how do you all do quite well i am much obliged to you never better don t i hear another carriage who can this be very likely the worthy coles upon my word this is charming to be standing about among such friends and such a noble fire i am quite roasted no coffee i thank you for me never take coffee a little tea if you please sir by and bye no hurry oh here it comes every thing so good
p00180_A,00180,A,jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners said i my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where i sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning
p00181_A,00181,A,and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected
p00182_A,00182,A,come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep
p00183_A,00183,A,brother and sister no indeed
p00184_A,00184,A,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally
p00185_A,00185,A,and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake
p00186_A,00186,A,upon my word i never heard of it till this moment
p00187_A,00187,A,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry
p00188_A,00188,A,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think
p00189_A,00189,A,i did not know that proper names were allowed
p00190_A,00190,A,aye very true my dear i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night
p00191_A,00191,A,you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible
p00192_A,00192,A,the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade
p00193_A,00193,A,i am i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone
p00194_A,00194,A,these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more
p00195_A,00195,A,well if you wish me to stay and join the party i will
p00196_A,00196,A,three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february
p00197_A,00197,A,your gallantry is really unanswerable but
p00198_A,00198,A,nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people
p00199_A,00199,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of
p00200_A,00200,A,is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of
p00201_A,00201,A,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00202_A,00202,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all
p00203_A,00203,A,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00204_A,00204,A,ah well to be sure yes i see what she means and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend
p00205_A,00205,A,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00206_A,00206,A,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00207_A,00207,A,what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know
p00208_A,00208,A,ah you will never guess you i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand
p00209_A,00209,A,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00210_A,00210,A,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00211_A,00211,A,with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm
p00212_A,00212,A,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever
p00213_A,00213,A,very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife
p00214_A,00214,A,she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember
p00215_A,00215,A,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p00216_A,00216,A,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p00217_A,00217,A,i am afraid jane is not very well but i do not know they tell me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone i am very little able have you a chair ma am do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently
p00218_A,00218,A,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s
p00219_A,00219,A,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p00220_A,00220,A,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time
p00221_A,00221,A,has your son been with you then
p00222_A,00222,A,well my dear i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me
p00223_A,00223,A,i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea
p00224_A,00224,A,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady
p00225_A,00225,A,true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe
p00226_A,00226,A,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error
p00227_A,00227,A,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful
p00228_A,00228,A,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come are you well my emma
p00229_A,00229,A,what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged
p00230_A,00230,A,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday
p00231_A,00231,A,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children
p00232_A,00232,A,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it
p00233_A,00233,A,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose
p00234_A,00234,A,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for
p00235_A,00235,A,it is frank and miss fairfax i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope
p00236_A,00236,A,very beautiful indeed
p00237_A,00237,A,i think we cannot do better let us send for the child
p00238_A,00238,A,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p00239_A,00239,A,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up
p00240_A,00240,A,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p00241_A,00241,A,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association
p00242_A,00242,A,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them
p00243_A,00243,A,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p00244_A,00244,A,fanny was good natured enough
p00245_A,00245,A,to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference
p00246_A,00246,A,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry
p00247_A,00247,A,my dear brother i will not believe this of you
p00248_A,00248,A,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p00249_A,00249,A,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p00250_A,00250,A,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage
p00251_A,00251,A,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart
p00252_A,00252,A,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me
p00253_A,00253,A,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong
p00254_A,00254,A,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right
p00255_A,00255,A,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p00256_A,00256,A,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p00257_A,00257,A,oh for shame a prison indeed sotherton court is the noblest old place in the world
p00258_A,00258,A,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p00259_A,00259,A,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p00260_A,00260,A,that is what i was thinking of as he has done so well by smith i think i had better have him at once his terms are five guineas a day
p00261_A,00261,A,sir it is a moor park we bought it as a moor park and it cost us that is it was a present from sir thomas but i saw the bill and i know it cost seven shillings and was charged as a moor park
p00262_A,00262,A,you were imposed on ma am these potatoes have as much the flavour of a moor park apricot as the fruit from that tree it is an insipid fruit at the best but a good apricot is eatable which none from my garden are
p00263_A,00263,A,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p00264_A,00264,A,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p00265_A,00265,A,smith has not much above a hundred acres altogether in his grounds which is little enough and makes it more surprising that the place can have been so improved now at sotherton we have a good seven hundred without reckoning the water meadows so that i think if so much could be done at compton we need not despair there have been two or three fine old trees cut down that grew too near the house and it opens the prospect amazingly which makes me think that repton or anybody of that sort would certainly have the avenue at sotherton down the avenue that leads from the west front to the top of the hill you know
p00266_A,00266,A,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p00267_A,00267,A,oh it does not signify whenever i do see it you will tell me how it has been altered
p00268_A,00268,A,i do not wish to influence mr rushworth but had i a place to new fashion i should not put myself into the hands of an improver i would rather have an inferior degree of beauty of my own choice and acquired progressively i would rather abide by my own blunders than by his
p00269_A,00269,A,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p00270_A,00270,A,if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing
p00271_A,00271,A,no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a twelvemonth would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the fewest possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be who loves me consults me confides in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and everything as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style that is a complete brother s letter
p00272_A,00272,A,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p00273_A,00273,A,my dear henry have you nothing to say you have been an improver yourself and from what i hear of everingham it may vie with any place in england its natural beauties i am sure are great everingham as it used to be was perfect in my estimation such a happy fall of ground and such timber what would i not give to see it again
p00274_A,00274,A,excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little remained to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before everingham was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr rushworth for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a devourer of my own
p00275_A,00275,A,those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly you can never want employment instead of envying mr rushworth you should assist him with your opinion
p00276_A,00276,A,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p00277_A,00277,A,but where is fanny is she gone to bed
p00278_A,00278,A,no not that i know of she was here a moment ago
p00279_A,00279,A,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa
p00280_A,00280,A,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p00281_A,00281,A,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p00282_A,00282,A,did you go out in the heat
p00283_A,00283,A,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p00284_A,00284,A,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p00285_A,00285,A,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p00286_A,00286,A,the loss of her ladyship s company would be a great drawback and she should have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at sotherton yet and it was a pity she should not see the place
p00287_A,00287,A,but why is it necessary that crawford s carriage or his only should be employed why is no use to be made of my mother s chaise i could not when the scheme was first mentioned the other day understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family
p00288_A,00288,A,what go boxed up three in a postchaise in this weather when we may have seats in a barouche no my dear edmund that will not quite do
p00289_A,00289,A,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p00290_A,00290,A,unpleasant oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss crawford will choose the barouche box herself
p00291_A,00291,A,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p00292_A,00292,A,you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do yes there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home fanny has a great desire to see sotherton i know she wishes it very much she has not often a gratification of the kind and i am sure ma am you would be glad to give her the pleasure now
p00293_A,00293,A,oh yes very glad if your aunt sees no objection
p00294_A,00294,A,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p00295_A,00295,A,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p00296_A,00296,A,as there are five of you it will be better that one should sit with henry and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive julia i think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson
p00297_A,00297,A,here is a fine burst of country i wish you had my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me press you ever so much
p00298_A,00298,A,yes it is exactly behind the house begins at a little distance and ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds you may see something of it here something of the more distant trees it is oak entirely
p00299_A,00299,A,now we are coming to the chapel which properly we ought to enter from above and look down upon but as we are quite among friends i will take you in this way if you will excuse me
p00300_A,00300,A,this chapel was fitted up as you see it in james the second s time before that period as i understand the pews were only wainscot and there is some reason to think that the linings and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth but this is not quite certain it is a handsome chapel and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain within the memory of many but the late mr rushworth left it off
p00301_A,00301,A,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p00302_A,00302,A,do look at mr rushworth and maria standing side by side exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed have not they completely the air of it
p00303_A,00303,A,if edmund were but in orders
p00304_A,00304,A,my dear edmund if you were but in orders now you might perform the ceremony directly how unlucky that you are not ordained mr rushworth and maria are quite ready
p00305_A,00305,A,for if we are too long going over the house we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors it is past two and we are to dine at five
p00306_A,00306,A,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p00307_A,00307,A,james i believe the wilderness will be new to all the party the miss bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet
p00308_A,00308,A,the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair sample of the rest
p00309_A,00309,A,not i should hope of the proportion of virtue to vice throughout the kingdom we do not look in great cities for our best morality it is not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be most felt a fine preacher is followed and admired but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of knowing his private character and observing his general conduct which in london can rarely be the case the clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners they are known to the largest part only as preachers and with regard to their influencing public manners miss crawford must not misunderstand me or suppose i mean to call them the arbiters of good breeding the regulators of refinement and courtesy the masters of the ceremonies of life the manners i speak of might rather be called conduct perhaps the result of good principles the effect in short of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i believe be everywhere found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to be so are the rest of the nation
p00310_A,00310,A,certainly
p00311_A,00311,A,now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i forestall you remember i have forestalled you
p00312_A,00312,A,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p00313_A,00313,A,your attentiveness and consideration makes me more sensible of my own neglect fanny s interest seems in safer hands with you than with me
p00314_A,00314,A,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p00315_A,00315,A,miss price all alone my dear fanny how comes this
p00316_A,00316,A,prohibited nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr rushworth will be here in a moment you know we shall not be out of sight
p00317_A,00317,A,or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that knoll the grove of oak on the knoll
p00318_A,00318,A,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye
p00319_A,00319,A,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts
p00320_A,00320,A,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly
p00321_A,00321,A,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear
p00322_A,00322,A,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information
p00323_A,00323,A,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away
p00324_A,00324,A,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p00325_A,00325,A,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p00326_A,00326,A,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p00327_A,00327,A,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p00328_A,00328,A,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it
p00329_A,00329,A,a strange business this in america dr grant what is your opinion i always come to you to know what i am to think of public matters
p00330_A,00330,A,my dear tom as you are not dancing i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber shall you
p00331_A,00331,A,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him
p00332_A,00332,A,it was a hard case upon my word i do think you were very much to be pitied
p00333_A,00333,A,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p00334_A,00334,A,oh for the ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with
p00335_A,00335,A,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p00336_A,00336,A,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p00337_A,00337,A,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p00338_A,00338,A,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p00339_A,00339,A,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p00340_A,00340,A,i think it would be very wrong in a general light private theatricals are open to some objections but as we are circumstanced i must think it would be highly injudicious and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind it would shew great want of feeling on my father s account absent as he is and in some degree of constant danger and it would be imprudent i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one considering everything extremely delicate
p00341_A,00341,A,what is the matter i was not asleep
p00342_A,00342,A,oh dear no ma am nobody suspected you well edmund
p00343_A,00343,A,no want of hands in our theatre miss bertram no want of understrappers my sister desires her love and hopes to be admitted into the company and will be happy to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante that you may not like to do yourselves
p00344_A,00344,A,oh no that will never do let us have no ranting tragedies too many characters not a tolerable woman s part in the play anything but that my dear tom it would be impossible to fill it up one could not expect anybody to take such a part nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end that might do perhaps but for the low parts if i must give my opinion i have always thought it the most insipid play in the english language i do not wish to make objections i shall be happy to be of any use but i think we could not chuse worse
p00345_A,00345,A,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p00346_A,00346,A,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p00347_A,00347,A,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p00348_A,00348,A,no no julia must not be amelia it is not at all the part for her she would not like it she would not do well she is too tall and robust amelia should be a small light girlish skipping figure it is fit for miss crawford and miss crawford only she looks the part and i am persuaded will do it admirably
p00349_A,00349,A,you must oblige us indeed you must when you have studied the character i am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be your choice but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions you will not refuse to visit me in prison i think i see you coming in with your basket
p00350_A,00350,A,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p00351_A,00351,A,we have got a play it is to be lovers vows and i am to be count cassel and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak and afterwards am to have another fine fancy suit by way of a shooting dress i do not know how i shall like it
p00352_A,00352,A,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p00353_A,00353,A,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p00354_A,00354,A,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p00355_A,00355,A,i am much obliged to you edmund you mean very well i am sure but i still think you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would be the greatest indecorum i think
p00356_A,00356,A,i am convinced madam that sir thomas would not like it
p00357_A,00357,A,there my dear do you hear what edmund says
p00358_A,00358,A,what if she knew your reasons
p00359_A,00359,A,well how do you go on what have you settled oh we can do nothing without you
p00360_A,00360,A,my good friends you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses inside and out but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile who is to be anhalt what gentleman among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to
p00361_A,00361,A,mr rushworth was to be count cassel but no one had yet undertaken anhalt
p00362_A,00362,A,the count has two and forty speeches which is no trifle
p00363_A,00363,A,i am not at all surprised at this want of an anhalt amelia deserves no better such a forward young lady may well frighten the men
p00364_A,00364,A,that circumstance would by no means tempt me for i should be sorry to make the character ridiculous by bad acting it must be very difficult to keep anhalt from appearing a formal solemn lecturer and the man who chuses the profession itself is perhaps one of the last who would wish to represent it on the stage
p00365_A,00365,A,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p00366_A,00366,A,indeed but you must for we cannot excuse you it need not frighten you it is a nothing of a part a mere nothing not above half a dozen speeches altogether and it will not much signify if nobody hears a word you say so you may be as creep mouse as you like but we must have you to look at
p00367_A,00367,A,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p00368_A,00368,A,phoo phoo do not be so shamefaced you ll do it very well every allowance will be made for you we do not expect perfection you must get a brown gown and a white apron and a mob cap and we must make you a few wrinkles and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your eyes and you will be a very proper little old woman
p00369_A,00369,A,you must excuse me indeed you must excuse me
p00370_A,00370,A,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p00371_A,00371,A,i am not going to urge her but i shall think her a very obstinate ungrateful girl if she does not do what her aunt and cousins wish her very ungrateful indeed considering who and what she is
p00372_A,00372,A,but there will not be the smallest difficulty in filling it we have but to speak the word we may pick and chuse i could name at this moment at least six young men within six miles of us who are wild to be admitted into our company and there are one or two that would not disgrace us i should not be afraid to trust either of the olivers or charles maddox tom oliver is a very clever fellow and charles maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will see anywhere so i will take my horse early to morrow morning and ride over to stoke and settle with one of them
p00373_A,00373,A,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p00374_A,00374,A,one cannot wonder sister that fanny should be delighted it is all new to her you know you and i used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am i still and as soon as i am a little more at leisure i mean to look in at their rehearsals too what is the play about fanny you have never told me
p00375_A,00375,A,you had better stay till the curtain is hung the curtain will be hung in a day or two there is very little sense in a play without a curtain and i am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up into very handsome festoons
p00376_A,00376,A,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p00377_A,00377,A,dr grant is ill he has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today he fancied it tough sent away his plate and has been suffering ever since
p00378_A,00378,A,if miss price would be so good as to read the part
p00379_A,00379,A,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p00380_A,00380,A,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part
p00381_A,00381,A,still the same anxiety for everybody s comfort my dear mrs norris but indeed i would rather have nothing but tea
p00382_A,00382,A,well then lady bertram suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry baddeley a little he seems behindhand to night
p00383_A,00383,A,indeed and what have you been acting
p00384_A,00384,A,oh they ll tell you all about it
p00385_A,00385,A,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p00386_A,00386,A,something must be done
p00387_A,00387,A,i come from your theatre i found myself in it rather unexpectedly its vicinity to my own room but in every respect indeed it took me by surprise as i had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character it appears a neat job however as far as i could judge by candlelight and does my friend christopher jackson credit
p00388_A,00388,A,this was in fact the origin of our acting my friend yates brought the infection from ecclesford and it spread as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from your having so often encouraged the sort of thing in us formerly it was like treading old ground again
p00389_A,00389,A,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence
p00390_A,00390,A,my indulgence shall be given sir but without any other rehearsal i come home to be happy and indulgent mr and miss crawford were mentioned in my last letters from mansfield do you find them agreeable acquaintance
p00391_A,00391,A,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p00392_A,00392,A,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p00393_A,00393,A,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p00394_A,00394,A,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish
p00395_A,00395,A,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day
p00396_A,00396,A,whose stables do you use at bath
p00397_A,00397,A,that is impossible fanny he must like him less after to morrow s visit for we shall be five hours in his company i should dread the stupidity of the day if there were not a much greater evil to follow the impression it must leave on sir thomas he cannot much longer deceive himself i am sorry for them all and would give something that rushworth and maria had never met
p00398_A,00398,A,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections
p00399_A,00399,A,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again
p00400_A,00400,A,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p00401_A,00401,A,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may
p00402_A,00402,A,thank you but there is no escaping these little vexations mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the nurseryman and the poulterer perhaps on their very account their remoteness and unpunctuality or their exorbitant charges and frauds will be drawing forth bitter lamentations
p00403_A,00403,A,you ought to be in parliament or you should have gone into the army ten years ago
p00404_A,00404,A,very well very well all the better i am glad to hear you have anything so good in the house but miss price and mr edmund bertram i dare say would take their chance we none of us want to hear the bill of fare a friendly meeting and not a fine dinner is all we have in view a turkey or a goose or a leg of mutton or whatever you and your cook chuse to give us
p00405_A,00405,A,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p00406_A,00406,A,i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked fanny
p00407_A,00407,A,if you cannot do without me ma am
p00408_A,00408,A,as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by fanny that being the first invitation it should be accepted
p00409_A,00409,A,sir thomas stop a moment i have something to say to you
p00410_A,00410,A,she will be late but what is your difficulty
p00411_A,00411,A,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her
p00412_A,00412,A,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p00413_A,00413,A,your sister perhaps may be prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home
p00414_A,00414,A,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p00415_A,00415,A,my dear sir thomas fanny can walk
p00416_A,00416,A,walk my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year will twenty minutes after four suit you
p00417_A,00417,A,mr yates oh we hear nothing of mr yates i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to mansfield park do you miss price i think my friend julia knows better than to entertain her father with mr yates
p00418_A,00418,A,as far as i am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle disapproved it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion everything had gone quite far enough
p00419_A,00419,A,nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather blank henry if your menus plaisirs were to be limited to seven hundred a year
p00420_A,00420,A,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you
p00421_A,00421,A,i shall keep clear of you crawford as long as i can for you would be more likely to disconcert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man
p00422_A,00422,A,do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in england i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the commissioner s at gibraltar appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but fanny can reconcile me to anything
p00423_A,00423,A,i hope your ladyship is pleased with the game
p00424_A,00424,A,oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr crawford does all the rest
p00425_A,00425,A,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas
p00426_A,00426,A,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me
p00427_A,00427,A,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p00428_A,00428,A,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p00429_A,00429,A,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p00430_A,00430,A,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p00431_A,00431,A,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered
p00432_A,00432,A,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins
p00433_A,00433,A,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p00434_A,00434,A,sir thomas undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest we must hope his son may prove that he knows it too
p00435_A,00435,A,yes very only i am soon tired
p00436_A,00436,A,i should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance have you never any balls at northampton i should like to see you dance and i d dance with you if you would for nobody would know who i was here and i should like to be your partner once more we used to jump about together many a time did not we when the hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good dancer in my way but i dare say you are a better is not fanny a very good dancer sir
p00437_A,00437,A,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p00438_A,00438,A,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p00439_A,00439,A,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement
p00440_A,00440,A,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words
p00441_A,00441,A,yes she does look very well chapman helped her to dress i sent chapman to her
p00442_A,00442,A,so soon my good friend it is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours
p00443_A,00443,A,well then fanny you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me
p00444_A,00444,A,oh yes sir i must get up and breakfast with him it will be the last time you know the last morning
p00445_A,00445,A,you had better not he is to have breakfasted and be gone by half past nine mr crawford i think you call for him at half past nine
p00446_A,00446,A,i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to morrow
p00447_A,00447,A,i cannot think what is the matter with me i feel quite stupid it must be sitting up so late last night fanny you must do something to keep me awake i cannot work fetch the cards i feel so very stupid
p00448_A,00448,A,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p00449_A,00449,A,and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at sotherton now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there and i am sure she is better off here and besides i cannot do without her
p00450_A,00450,A,no i do not
p00451_A,00451,A,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her
p00452_A,00452,A,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them
p00453_A,00453,A,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny
p00454_A,00454,A,no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price
p00455_A,00455,A,my dear there is no occasion for this your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to be said or done from this hour the subject is never to be revived between us you will have nothing to fear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations your happiness and advantage are all that i have in view and nothing is required of you but to bear with mr crawford s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his he proceeds at his own risk you are on safe ground i have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred you will see him with the rest of us in the same manner and as much as you can dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant he leaves northamptonshire so soon that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded the future must be very uncertain and now my dear fanny this subject is closed between us
p00456_A,00456,A,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p00457_A,00457,A,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps
p00458_A,00458,A,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent
p00459_A,00459,A,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p00460_A,00460,A,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p00461_A,00461,A,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing
p00462_A,00462,A,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy
p00463_A,00463,A,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice
p00464_A,00464,A,you are just in time we have been looking for you this half hour the thrush went out of harbour this morning i saw her it was a beautiful sight and they think she will have her orders in a day or two and mr campbell was here at four o clock to ask for you he has got one of the thrush s boats and is going off to her at six and hoped you would be here in time to go with him
p00465_A,00465,A,i was upstairs mama moving my things you know you had but just settled that my sister fanny and i should have the other room and i could not get rebecca to give me any help
p00466_A,00466,A,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p00467_A,00467,A,devil take those young dogs how they are singing out ay sam s voice louder than all the rest that boy is fit for a boatswain holla you there sam stop your confounded pipe or i shall be after you
p00468_A,00468,A,come girls come fan come sue take care of yourselves keep a sharp lookout
p00469_A,00469,A,mansfield sotherton thornton lacey what a society will be comprised in those houses and at michaelmas perhaps a fourth may be added some small hunting box in the vicinity of everything so dear for as to any partnership in thornton lacey as edmund bertram once good humouredly proposed i hope i foresee two objections two fair excellent irresistible objections to that plan
p00470_A,00470,A,i do not know i have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt perhaps i may be to stay longer it may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly at the two months end
p00471_A,00471,A,i know mansfield i know its way i know its faults towards you i know the danger of your being so far forgotten as to have your comforts give way to the imaginary convenience of any single being in the family i am aware that you may be left here week after week if sir thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself or sending your aunt s maid for you without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he may have laid down for the next quarter of a year this will not do two months is an ample allowance i should think six weeks quite enough i am considering your sister s health which i think the confinement of portsmouth unfavourable to she requires constant air and exercise when you know her as well as i do i am sure you will agree that she does and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of the country if therefore you find yourself growing unwell and any difficulties arise about your returning to mansfield without waiting for the two months to be ended that must not be regarded as of any consequence if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable than usual and will only let my sister know it give her only the slightest hint she and i will immediately come down and take you back to mansfield you know the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done you know all that would be felt on the occasion i am perfectly serious as you perfectly know and i hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition indeed you shall not it shall not be in your power for so long only as you positively say in every letter to mary i am well and i know you cannot speak or write a falsehood so long only shall you be considered as well
p00472_A,00472,A,my poor sister bertram must be in a great deal of trouble
p00473_A,00473,A,it is a mistake sir it must be a mistake it cannot be true it must mean some other people
p00474_A,00474,A,dear fanny now i shall be comfortable
p00475_A,00475,A,i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and i wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend i will give you this little book on purpose
p00476_A,00476,A,i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back
p00477_A,00477,A,well miss morland i hope you have had an agreeable ball
p00478_A,00478,A,very agreeable indeed
p00479_A,00479,A,we shall do better another evening i hope
p00480_A,00480,A,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown
p00481_A,00481,A,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p00482_A,00482,A,how can you be so
p00483_A,00483,A,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p00484_A,00484,A,how excessively like her brother miss morland is
p00485_A,00485,A,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p00486_A,00486,A,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p00487_A,00487,A,i do not know the distance
p00488_A,00488,A,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p00489_A,00489,A,that was very good natured of you
p00490_A,00490,A,oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful
p00491_A,00491,A,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p00492_A,00492,A,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p00493_A,00493,A,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00494_A,00494,A,i have never read it
p00495_A,00495,A,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p00496_A,00496,A,i assure you i would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world for if i did we should certainly be separated the whole evening
p00497_A,00497,A,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00498_A,00498,A,i beg your pardon miss morland for this liberty but i cannot anyhow get to miss thorpe and mrs thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you
p00499_A,00499,A,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p00500_A,00500,A,there you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me
p00501_A,00501,A,very agreeable madam
p00502_A,00502,A,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p00503_A,00503,A,where can he be
p00504_A,00504,A,i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son
p00505_A,00505,A,dearest catherine
p00506_A,00506,A,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p00507_A,00507,A,my dearest creature you have been at least three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill what a delightful ball we had last night i have a thousand things to say to you but make haste and get in for i long to be off
p00508_A,00508,A,past three o clock
p00509_A,00509,A,i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well
p00510_A,00510,A,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p00511_A,00511,A,do not be frightened my dear catherine but i am really going to dance with your brother again i declare positively it is quite shocking i tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance make haste my dear creature and come to us john is just walked off but he will be back in a moment
p00512_A,00512,A,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p00513_A,00513,A,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p00514_A,00514,A,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father
p00515_A,00515,A,my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston
p00516_A,00516,A,i doubt our being able to do so much
p00517_A,00517,A,by dozens
p00518_A,00518,A,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00519_A,00519,A,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p00520_A,00520,A,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p00521_A,00521,A,yes yes every hole and corner
p00522_A,00522,A,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00523_A,00523,A,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p00524_A,00524,A,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00525_A,00525,A,stop stop mr thorpe it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton
p00526_A,00526,A,we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on today your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round
p00527_A,00527,A,it is all one to me
p00528_A,00528,A,how i pity the poor creatures that are going there how glad i am that i am not amongst them i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not they have not begun dancing yet i would not be there for all the world it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself i dare say it will not be a very good ball i know the mitchells will not be there i am sure i pity everybody that is but i dare say mr morland you long to be at it do not you i am sure you do well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence
p00529_A,00529,A,go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
p00530_A,00530,A,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00531_A,00531,A,my dear you tumble my gown
p00532_A,00532,A,i angry i could have no right
p00533_A,00533,A,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p00534_A,00534,A,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p00535_A,00535,A,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00536_A,00536,A,no no no
p00537_A,00537,A,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00538_A,00538,A,catherine you must go
p00539_A,00539,A,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00540_A,00540,A,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00541_A,00541,A,i suspect there is no great struggle
p00542_A,00542,A,you have not
p00543_A,00543,A,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p00544_A,00544,A,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00545_A,00545,A,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00546_A,00546,A,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p00547_A,00547,A,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p00548_A,00548,A,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p00549_A,00549,A,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p00550_A,00550,A,that is just what i was going to say
p00551_A,00551,A,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p00552_A,00552,A,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00553_A,00553,A,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p00554_A,00554,A,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p00555_A,00555,A,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00556_A,00556,A,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00557_A,00557,A,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00558_A,00558,A,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p00559_A,00559,A,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p00560_A,00560,A,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p00561_A,00561,A,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00562_A,00562,A,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p00563_A,00563,A,riot what riot
p00564_A,00564,A,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me
p00565_A,00565,A,she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper
p00566_A,00566,A,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p00567_A,00567,A,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria
p00568_A,00568,A,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p00569_A,00569,A,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour
p00570_A,00570,A,he is very handsome indeed
p00571_A,00571,A,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p00572_A,00572,A,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00573_A,00573,A,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p00574_A,00574,A,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p00575_A,00575,A,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world
p00576_A,00576,A,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month
p00577_A,00577,A,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way
p00578_A,00578,A,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction
p00579_A,00579,A,is it a pretty place
p00580_A,00580,A,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p00581_A,00581,A,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p00582_A,00582,A,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p00583_A,00583,A,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p00584_A,00584,A,our friends from fullerton
p00585_A,00585,A,eleanor
p00586_A,00586,A,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill
p00587_A,00587,A,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p00588_A,00588,A,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p00589_A,00589,A,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00590_A,00590,A,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p00591_A,00591,A,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p00592_A,00592,A,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves
p00593_A,00593,A,but he will tell only half of it
p00594_A,00594,A,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p00595_A,00595,A,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return
p00596_A,00596,A,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p00597_A,00597,A,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p00598_A,00598,A,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p00599_A,00599,A,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p00600_A,00600,A,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets
p00601_A,00601,A,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00602_A,00602,A,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p00603_A,00603,A,i really have not patience with the general
p00604_A,00604,A,do i oh perfectly
p00605_A,00605,A,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p00606_A,00606,A,advertise
p00607_A,00607,A,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying
p00608_A,00608,A,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00609_A,00609,A,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier
p00610_A,00610,A,very true very true what miss anne says is very true
p00611_A,00611,A,oh certainly
p00612_A,00612,A,indeed
p00613_A,00613,A,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p00614_A,00614,A,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00615_A,00615,A,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery
p00616_A,00616,A,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00617_A,00617,A,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00618_A,00618,A,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure
p00619_A,00619,A,i cannot possibly do without anne
p00620_A,00620,A,i think very differently an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me
p00621_A,00621,A,and i will tell you our reason and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things
p00622_A,00622,A,nothing can be going on better than the child so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use anne will send for me if anything is the matter
p00623_A,00623,A,well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband leave little charles to my care mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him
p00624_A,00624,A,this is very kind of anne and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child
p00625_A,00625,A,i felt my luck admiral i assure you i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something
p00626_A,00626,A,to be sure you did what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again
p00627_A,00627,A,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00628_A,00628,A,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00629_A,00629,A,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00630_A,00630,A,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00631_A,00631,A,and i am sure sir it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship we shall never forget what you did poor dear fellow he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you
p00632_A,00632,A,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00633_A,00633,A,my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth
p00634_A,00634,A,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00635_A,00635,A,ay that we shall
p00636_A,00636,A,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p00637_A,00637,A,what a great traveller you must have been ma am
p00638_A,00638,A,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p00639_A,00639,A,aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again
p00640_A,00640,A,i hope the little boy is better
p00641_A,00641,A,how do you do will you not sit down the others will be here presently
p00642_A,00642,A,ah you make the most of it i know but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
p00643_A,00643,A,had you i honour you
p00644_A,00644,A,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p00645_A,00645,A,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p00646_A,00646,A,no
p00647_A,00647,A,no no
p00648_A,00648,A,oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good
p00649_A,00649,A,it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life
p00650_A,00650,A,pray can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away
p00651_A,00651,A,no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day
p00652_A,00652,A,of course you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him
p00653_A,00653,A,i am determined i will
p00654_A,00654,A,she is dead she is dead
p00655_A,00655,A,true true a surgeon this instant
p00656_A,00656,A,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00657_A,00657,A,had not she better be carried to the inn yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
p00658_A,00658,A,i have been considering what we had best do she must not appear at first she could not stand it i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove do you think this is a good plan
p00659_A,00659,A,no i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks oh i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very fine i overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end of miss elliot s charms
p00660_A,00660,A,and i am sure it was a very little to his credit if he did miss harville only died last june such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell i am sure you will agree with me
p00661_A,00661,A,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00662_A,00662,A,well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick
p00663_A,00663,A,you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word he is not at all a well bred young man i am sure you will not like him
p00664_A,00664,A,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00665_A,00665,A,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00666_A,00666,A,you will not like him i will answer for it
p00667_A,00667,A,he is a man whom i have no wish to see his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me
p00668_A,00668,A,if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse
p00669_A,00669,A,the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view
p00670_A,00670,A,elizabeth
p00671_A,00671,A,elizabeth very well time will explain
p00672_A,00672,A,it was an acquaintance worth having
p00673_A,00673,A,i love your indignation it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him
p00674_A,00674,A,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now
p00675_A,00675,A,westgate buildings and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings a mrs smith a widow mrs smith and who was her husband one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere and what is her attraction that she is old and sickly upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you but surely you may put off this old lady till to morrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day what is her age forty
p00676_A,00676,A,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00677_A,00677,A,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p00678_A,00678,A,what is this the crofts have arrived in bath the crofts who rent kellynch what have they brought you oh those letters are convenient passports they secure an introduction i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate i know what is due to my tenant
p00679_A,00679,A,how is mary and pray what brings the crofts to bath
p00680_A,00680,A,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00681_A,00681,A,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00682_A,00682,A,have they any acquaintance here
p00683_A,00683,A,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00684_A,00684,A,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p00685_A,00685,A,you will wonder what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night they described the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description
p00686_A,00686,A,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust
p00687_A,00687,A,a very fine young man indeed more air than one often sees in bath irish i dare say
p00688_A,00688,A,my dear miss elliot
p00689_A,00689,A,and mine kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately
p00690_A,00690,A,to be sure he is nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read he is a brave fellow i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in my father s great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since
p00691_A,00691,A,do come anne come and look yourself you will be too late if you do not make haste they are parting they are shaking hands he is turning away not know mr elliot indeed you seem to have forgot all about lyme
p00692_A,00692,A,yes it is mr elliot certainly he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend
p00693_A,00693,A,but you must go charles it would be unpardonable to fail we were asked on purpose to be introduced there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with every attention is due to mr elliot consider my father s heir the future representative of the family
p00694_A,00694,A,don t talk to me about heirs and representatives i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir what is mr elliot to me
p00695_A,00695,A,we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials
p00696_A,00696,A,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this
p00697_A,00697,A,not quite a few lines more i shall have done in five minutes
p00698_A,00698,A,you are a good soul there is no quarrelling with you and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied
p00699_A,00699,A,here frederick you and i part company i believe i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party we had your sister s card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves
p00700_A,00700,A,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00701_A,00701,A,good morning god bless you
p00702_A,00702,A,do you think so but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry will you promise me to mention it when you see them again you will see them both this morning i dare say do promise me
p00703_A,00703,A,are you going as high as belmont are you going near camden place because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop
p00704_A,00704,A,it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
p00705_A,00705,A,depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all
p00706_A,00706,A,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
p00707_A,00707,A,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p00708_A,00708,A,don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
p00709_A,00709,A,kitty has no discretion in her coughs she times them ill
p00710_A,00710,A,i do not cough for my own amusement
p00711_A,00711,A,to morrow fortnight
p00712_A,00712,A,now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse
p00713_A,00713,A,my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
p00714_A,00714,A,aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to
p00715_A,00715,A,miss bingley told me
p00716_A,00716,A,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable
p00717_A,00717,A,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p00718_A,00718,A,another time lizzy i would not dance with him if i were you
p00719_A,00719,A,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p00720_A,00720,A,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine
p00721_A,00721,A,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p00722_A,00722,A,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p00723_A,00723,A,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p00724_A,00724,A,that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
p00725_A,00725,A,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic
p00726_A,00726,A,you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers very well if it must be so it must there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song
p00727_A,00727,A,it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
p00728_A,00728,A,he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner
p00729_A,00729,A,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish
p00730_A,00730,A,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p00731_A,00731,A,well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
p00732_A,00732,A,it is from miss bingley
p00733_A,00733,A,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p00734_A,00734,A,can i have the carriage
p00735_A,00735,A,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p00736_A,00736,A,i had much rather go in the coach
p00737_A,00737,A,but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they
p00738_A,00738,A,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p00739_A,00739,A,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p00740_A,00740,A,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders
p00741_A,00741,A,oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage how can you be so silly as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there
p00742_A,00742,A,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p00743_A,00743,A,no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
p00744_A,00744,A,she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
p00745_A,00745,A,yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office
p00746_A,00746,A,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p00747_A,00747,A,certainly not
p00748_A,00748,A,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p00749_A,00749,A,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p00750_A,00750,A,yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
p00751_A,00751,A,that is capital
p00752_A,00752,A,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p00753_A,00753,A,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p00754_A,00754,A,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p00755_A,00755,A,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p00756_A,00756,A,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p00757_A,00757,A,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p00758_A,00758,A,i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
p00759_A,00759,A,upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
p00760_A,00760,A,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p00761_A,00761,A,all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
p00762_A,00762,A,yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished
p00763_A,00763,A,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p00764_A,00764,A,nor i i am sure
p00765_A,00765,A,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p00766_A,00766,A,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p00767_A,00767,A,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this
p00768_A,00768,A,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united
p00769_A,00769,A,undoubtedly there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
p00770_A,00770,A,indeed i have sir she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
p00771_A,00771,A,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p00772_A,00772,A,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p00773_A,00773,A,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p00774_A,00774,A,i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
p00775_A,00775,A,that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
p00776_A,00776,A,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p00777_A,00777,A,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p00778_A,00778,A,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p00779_A,00779,A,indeed mama you are mistaken you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true
p00780_A,00780,A,she seems a very pleasant young woman
p00781_A,00781,A,oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were
p00782_A,00782,A,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p00783_A,00783,A,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
p00784_A,00784,A,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p00785_A,00785,A,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p00786_A,00786,A,they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine
p00787_A,00787,A,it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill
p00788_A,00788,A,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p00789_A,00789,A,my style of writing is very different from yours
p00790_A,00790,A,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p00791_A,00791,A,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p00792_A,00792,A,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p00793_A,00793,A,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
p00794_A,00794,A,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month
p00795_A,00795,A,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
p00796_A,00796,A,upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself
p00797_A,00797,A,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
p00798_A,00798,A,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this
p00799_A,00799,A,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
p00800_A,00800,A,i did not know that you intended to walk
p00801_A,00801,A,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out
p00802_A,00802,A,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye
p00803_A,00803,A,very glad
p00804_A,00804,A,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball
p00805_A,00805,A,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude
p00806_A,00806,A,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
p00807_A,00807,A,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
p00808_A,00808,A,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself
p00809_A,00809,A,such as vanity and pride
p00810_A,00810,A,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
p00811_A,00811,A,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p00812_A,00812,A,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body
p00813_A,00813,A,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
p00814_A,00814,A,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him
p00815_A,00815,A,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p00816_A,00816,A,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p00817_A,00817,A,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p00818_A,00818,A,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
p00819_A,00819,A,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p00820_A,00820,A,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p00821_A,00821,A,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life
p00822_A,00822,A,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure
p00823_A,00823,A,i know very well madam that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters
p00824_A,00824,A,i believe her to be both in a great degree i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class
p00825_A,00825,A,i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here
p00826_A,00826,A,i dare say you will find him very agreeable
p00827_A,00827,A,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life
p00828_A,00828,A,i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
p00829_A,00829,A,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours
p00830_A,00830,A,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant
p00831_A,00831,A,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
p00832_A,00832,A,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
p00833_A,00833,A,lord how tired i am
p00834_A,00834,A,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning
p00835_A,00835,A,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p00836_A,00836,A,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins
p00837_A,00837,A,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
p00838_A,00838,A,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him
p00839_A,00839,A,i have sir
p00840_A,00840,A,my dear i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be
p00841_A,00841,A,now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together
p00842_A,00842,A,i found as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself
p00843_A,00843,A,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
p00844_A,00844,A,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood
p00845_A,00845,A,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves
p00846_A,00846,A,i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford my father and maria are to come to me in march and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them
p00847_A,00847,A,lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed and a most attentive neighbour
p00848_A,00848,A,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
p00849_A,00849,A,do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved
p00850_A,00850,A,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age
p00851_A,00851,A,my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there
p00852_A,00852,A,we are speaking of music madam
p00853_A,00853,A,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p00854_A,00854,A,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house
p00855_A,00855,A,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
p00856_A,00856,A,i am not afraid of you
p00857_A,00857,A,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p00858_A,00858,A,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
p00859_A,00859,A,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers
p00860_A,00860,A,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p00861_A,00861,A,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers
p00862_A,00862,A,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn
p00863_A,00863,A,you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn are you pleased with kent
p00864_A,00864,A,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
p00865_A,00865,A,my uncle is to send a servant for us
p00866_A,00866,A,oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to
p00867_A,00867,A,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
p00868_A,00868,A,and mary king is safe safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune
p00869_A,00869,A,i am glad you are come back lizzy
p00870_A,00870,A,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book
p00871_A,00871,A,it was a subject which they could not mention before me
p00872_A,00872,A,if one could but go to brighton
p00873_A,00873,A,oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable
p00874_A,00874,A,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
p00875_A,00875,A,do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life
p00876_A,00876,A,i have heard much of your master s fine person it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not
p00877_A,00877,A,yes very handsome
p00878_A,00878,A,is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
p00879_A,00879,A,not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
p00880_A,00880,A,if your master would marry you might see more of him
p00881_A,00881,A,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p00882_A,00882,A,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p00883_A,00883,A,yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world
p00884_A,00884,A,his father was an excellent man
p00885_A,00885,A,yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor he is the best landlord and the best master that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
p00886_A,00886,A,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her
p00887_A,00887,A,for your housekeeper informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country
p00888_A,00888,A,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton
p00889_A,00889,A,pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family
p00890_A,00890,A,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled
p00891_A,00891,A,that is all settled
p00892_A,00892,A,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk
p00893_A,00893,A,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p00894_A,00894,A,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage
p00895_A,00895,A,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all
p00896_A,00896,A,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
p00897_A,00897,A,do you suppose them to be in london
p00898_A,00898,A,and lydia used to want to go to london
p00899_A,00899,A,she is happy then and her residence there will probably be of some duration lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind
p00900_A,00900,A,you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner well well do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them
p00901_A,00901,A,dear madam don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter
p00902_A,00902,A,well and what news does it bring good or bad
p00903_A,00903,A,what is there of good to be expected but perhaps you would like to read it read it aloud for i hardly know myself what it is about
p00904_A,00904,A,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you
p00905_A,00905,A,no but it must be done soon
p00906_A,00906,A,oh my dear father come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case
p00907_A,00907,A,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p00908_A,00908,A,and they must marry yet he is such a man
p00909_A,00909,A,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p00910_A,00910,A,no wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
p00911_A,00911,A,ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid
p00912_A,00912,A,take whatever you like and get away
p00913_A,00913,A,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p00914_A,00914,A,i should like it beyond any thing
p00915_A,00915,A,mr darcy
p00916_A,00916,A,oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
p00917_A,00917,A,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p00918_A,00918,A,write to me very often my dear
p00919_A,00919,A,as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do
p00920_A,00920,A,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p00921_A,00921,A,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p00922_A,00922,A,well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
p00923_A,00923,A,you may depend on it for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed
p00924_A,00924,A,la it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr what s his name that tall proud man
p00925_A,00925,A,you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement
p00926_A,00926,A,my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
p00927_A,00927,A,well girls what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously
p00928_A,00928,A,what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do
p00929_A,00929,A,nothing child nothing i did not wink at you come here my love i want to speak to you lizzy my dear i want to speak with you
p00930_A,00930,A,we may as well leave them by themselves you know kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room
p00931_A,00931,A,jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman you are a good girl and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income
p00932_A,00932,A,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p00933_A,00933,A,yes very well i saw them the night before last miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company
p00934_A,00934,A,go my dear and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
p00935_A,00935,A,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now
p00936_A,00936,A,it may do very well for the others but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty
p00937_A,00937,A,go to your father he wants you in the library
p00938_A,00938,A,good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted my dearest child i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow
p00939_A,00939,A,you may esteem him
p00940_A,00940,A,as for the house itself to be sure it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may think about building these parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very snug little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect every thing though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly
p00941_A,00941,A,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p00942_A,00942,A,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p00943_A,00943,A,had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess marianne is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever
p00944_A,00944,A,i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time
p00945_A,00945,A,and what sort of a young man is he
p00946_A,00946,A,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p00947_A,00947,A,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p00948_A,00948,A,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p00949_A,00949,A,that is an expression sir john which i particularly dislike i abhor every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one s cap at a man or making a conquest are the most odious of all their tendency is gross and illiberal and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity
p00950_A,00950,A,ay you will make conquests enough i dare say one way or other poor brandon he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles
p00951_A,00951,A,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p00952_A,00952,A,my love you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
p00953_A,00953,A,brandon is just the kind of man whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to
p00954_A,00954,A,that is exactly what i think of him
p00955_A,00955,A,in defence of your prot g you can even be saucy
p00956_A,00956,A,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p00957_A,00957,A,i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him
p00958_A,00958,A,i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body s good word and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year
p00959_A,00959,A,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p00960_A,00960,A,miss dashwood you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
p00961_A,00961,A,take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his
p00962_A,00962,A,remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them
p00963_A,00963,A,yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say
p00964_A,00964,A,well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f
p00965_A,00965,A,what is the matter with brandon
p00966_A,00966,A,no ma am it came from town and is merely a letter of business
p00967_A,00967,A,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p00968_A,00968,A,in town what can you have to do in town at this time of year
p00969_A,00969,A,my own loss is great in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell
p00970_A,00970,A,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p00971_A,00971,A,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p00972_A,00972,A,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p00973_A,00973,A,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p00974_A,00974,A,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p00975_A,00975,A,there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell well then when will you come back again
p00976_A,00976,A,i hope we shall see you at barton as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return
p00977_A,00977,A,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p00978_A,00978,A,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p00979_A,00979,A,well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind
p00980_A,00980,A,i am afraid none at all
p00981_A,00981,A,then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do
p00982_A,00982,A,come colonel before you go do let us know what you are going about
p00983_A,00983,A,and who is miss williams
p00984_A,00984,A,what do not you know who miss williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel s my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies
p00985_A,00985,A,indeed
p00986_A,00986,A,i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning
p00987_A,00987,A,where pray
p00988_A,00988,A,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p00989_A,00989,A,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p00990_A,00990,A,i flatter myself that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this
p00991_A,00991,A,there certainly are circumstances which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share how often did i wish when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford you are a good woman your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me
p00992_A,00992,A,shall we see you tomorrow to dinner i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton
p00993_A,00993,A,my engagements at present are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy
p00994_A,00994,A,why do you not ask marianne at once whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence it would be the natural result of your affection for her she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially
p00995_A,00995,A,we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens
p00996_A,00996,A,months no nor many weeks
p00997_A,00997,A,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p00998_A,00998,A,he has he has i am sure he has his air his coat his horse i knew how soon he would come
p00999_A,00999,A,a fortnight
p01000_A,01000,A,have you been lately in sussex
p01001_A,01001,A,i was at norland about a month ago
p01002_A,01002,A,it is not every one who has your passion for dead leaves
p01003_A,01003,A,have you an agreeable neighbourhood here are the middletons pleasant people
p01004_A,01004,A,no nor how many painful moments
p01005_A,01005,A,you have no ambition i well know your wishes are all moderate
p01006_A,01006,A,as moderate as those of the rest of the world i believe i wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy but like every body else it must be in my own way greatness will not make me so
p01007_A,01007,A,two thousand a year one is my wealth i guessed how it would end
p01008_A,01008,A,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p01009_A,01009,A,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p01010_A,01010,A,oh that they would
p01011_A,01011,A,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p01012_A,01012,A,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p01013_A,01013,A,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p01014_A,01014,A,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p01015_A,01015,A,perhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged i presume
p01016_A,01016,A,undoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed it is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to change them
p01017_A,01017,A,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p01018_A,01018,A,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p01019_A,01019,A,i believe you are right and yet i have always set her down as a lively girl
p01020_A,01020,A,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p01021_A,01021,A,marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers
p01022_A,01022,A,yes very
p01023_A,01023,A,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p01024_A,01024,A,you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
p01025_A,01025,A,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p01026_A,01026,A,you must drink tea with us to night for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party
p01027_A,01027,A,a dance impossible who is to dance
p01028_A,01028,A,who why yourselves and the careys and whitakers to be sure what you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone
p01029_A,01029,A,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p01030_A,01030,A,well what a delightful room this is i never saw anything so charming only think mama how it is improved since i was here last i always thought it such a sweet place ma am turning to mrs dashwood but you have made it so charming only look sister how delightful every thing is how i should like such a house for myself should not you mr palmer mr palmer does not hear me he never does sometimes it is so ridiculous
p01031_A,01031,A,you may believe how glad we all were to see them but however i can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by london upon account of some business for you know it was wrong in her situation i wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all she expects to be confined in february
p01032_A,01032,A,no none at all
p01033_A,01033,A,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p01034_A,01034,A,how horrid all this is such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain it makes one detest all one s acquaintance what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house how few people know what comfort is sir john is as stupid as the weather
p01035_A,01035,A,i am afraid miss marianne you have not been able to take your usual walk to allenham today
p01036_A,01036,A,as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life
p01037_A,01037,A,is it very ugly then it must be some other place that is so pretty i suppose
p01038_A,01038,A,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p01039_A,01039,A,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p01040_A,01040,A,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p01041_A,01041,A,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p01042_A,01042,A,i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your mother ill bred
p01043_A,01043,A,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p01044_A,01044,A,no i never said any thing so irrational don t palm all your abuses of language upon me
p01045_A,01045,A,john is in such spirits today he is full of monkey tricks how playful william is and here is my sweet little annamaria and she is always so gentle and quiet never was there such a quiet little thing
p01046_A,01046,A,poor little creatures it might have been a very sad accident
p01047_A,01047,A,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p01048_A,01048,A,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p01049_A,01049,A,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p01050_A,01050,A,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p01051_A,01051,A,i confess that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence
p01052_A,01052,A,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p01053_A,01053,A,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p01054_A,01054,A,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p01055_A,01055,A,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p01056_A,01056,A,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p01057_A,01057,A,his name is ferrars but pray do not tell it for it s a great secret
p01058_A,01058,A,ferrars mr ferrars is the happy man is he what your sister in law s brother miss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure i know him very well
p01059_A,01059,A,i did
p01060_A,01060,A,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p01061_A,01061,A,you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles my poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends upon having it done
p01062_A,01062,A,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p01063_A,01063,A,marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard
p01064_A,01064,A,perhaps if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
p01065_A,01065,A,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p01066_A,01066,A,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p01067_A,01067,A,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p01068_A,01068,A,edward s love for me has been pretty well put to the test by our long very long absence since we were first engaged and it has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now i can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and from our different situations in life from his being so much more in the world than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or any lowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talked more of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he used to be i do not mean to say that i am particularly observant or quick sighted in general but in such a case i am sure i could not be deceived
p01069_A,01069,A,a great coxcomb oh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say
p01070_A,01070,A,no sister you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs
p01071_A,01071,A,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p01072_A,01072,A,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p01073_A,01073,A,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it
p01074_A,01074,A,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
p01075_A,01075,A,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence
p01076_A,01076,A,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p01077_A,01077,A,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family
p01078_A,01078,A,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
p01079_A,01079,A,mr palmer will be so happy to see you what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama i forget what it was now but it was something so droll
p01080_A,01080,A,if this open weather holds much longer sir john will not like leaving barton next week tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart
p01081_A,01081,A,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight
p01082_A,01082,A,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p01083_A,01083,A,no ma am for my mistress
p01084_A,01084,A,nor i our situations then are alike we have neither of us any thing to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing
p01085_A,01085,A,i do not know
p01086_A,01086,A,so my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir john met him somewhere in the street this morning
p01087_A,01087,A,by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sister s writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her
p01088_A,01088,A,yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me
p01089_A,01089,A,no elinor ask nothing you will soon know all
p01090_A,01090,A,how do you do my dear how is she miss dashwood poor thing she looks very bad no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married very soon a good for nothing fellow i have no patience with him mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was said i and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion of men s going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not the only young man in the world worth having and with your pretty face you will never want admirers well poor thing i won t disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her
p01091_A,01091,A,no no no it cannot be she cannot feel her kindness is not sympathy her good nature is not tenderness all that she wants is gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it
p01092_A,01092,A,now my dear i bring you something that i am sure will do you good
p01093_A,01093,A,i will not trust to that a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others
p01094_A,01094,A,i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word
p01095_A,01095,A,aye aye that is very pretty talking but it won t do the doctor is the man i see
p01096_A,01096,A,no indeed and i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of
p01097_A,01097,A,no i do not think we shall
p01098_A,01098,A,oh yes i dare say you will what a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together
p01099_A,01099,A,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p01100_A,01100,A,oh dear that is a great pity but such old friends as lucy and me i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word oh if that s all we can just as well go and see her
p01101_A,01101,A,these are done by my eldest sister and you as a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them i do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well
p01102_A,01102,A,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p01103_A,01103,A,miss morton is lord morton s daughter
p01104_A,01104,A,ah poor dear
p01105_A,01105,A,i was engaged elsewhere
p01106_A,01106,A,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p01107_A,01107,A,not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation going so soon my dear edward this must not be
p01108_A,01108,A,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly
p01109_A,01109,A,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy
p01110_A,01110,A,gracious god can this be possible
p01111_A,01111,A,get it all out of her my dear she will tell you any thing if you ask you see i cannot leave mrs clarke
p01112_A,01112,A,wait for his having a living ay we all know how that will end they will wait a twelvemonth and finding no good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a year with the interest of his two thousand pounds and what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can give her then they will have a child every year and lord help em how poor they will be i must see what i can give them towards furnishing their house two maids and two men indeed as i talked of t other day no no they must get a stout girl of all works betty s sister would never do for them now very well indeed how prettily she writes aye that was quite proper to let him be off if he would that was just like lucy poor soul i wish i could get him a living with all my heart she calls me you see she is a good hearted girl as ever lived very well upon my word that sentence is very prettily turned yes yes i will go and see her sure enough how attentive she is to think of every body thank you my dear for showing it me it is as pretty a letter as ever i saw and does lucy s head and heart great credit
p01113_A,01113,A,i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p01114_A,01114,A,this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
p01115_A,01115,A,the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shan t go if lucy an t there
p01116_A,01116,A,certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other of one thing my dear sister i may assure you and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it but i have it from the very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her daughter did and i have it from her that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection you understand me it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all she said and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately
p01117_A,01117,A,yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved
p01118_A,01118,A,but she must not go round by london i shall never see her if she goes by london
p01119_A,01119,A,but she will be gained by some one else and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye god bless you
p01120_A,01120,A,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one
p01121_A,01121,A,our situations have borne little resemblance
p01122_A,01122,A,i know it i know it happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt
p01123_A,01123,A,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife
p01124_A,01124,A,i have not a doubt of it and i have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly
p01125_A,01125,A,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
p01126_A,01126,A,did mrs ferrars look well
p01127_A,01127,A,yes ma am she said how she was very well and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady and she seemed vastly contented
p01128_A,01128,A,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p01129_A,01129,A,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars
p01130_A,01130,A,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish
p01131_A,01131,A,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be
p01132_A,01132,A,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering
p01133_A,01133,A,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
p00000_B,00000,B,it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk
p00001_B,00001,B,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by
p00002_B,00002,B,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00003_B,00003,B,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00004_B,00004,B,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00005_B,00005,B,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00006_B,00006,B,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing
p00007_B,00007,B,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00008_B,00008,B,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said
p00009_B,00009,B,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously
p00010_B,00010,B,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00011_B,00011,B,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00012_B,00012,B,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you
p00013_B,00013,B,well done mrs martin you know what you are about
p00014_B,00014,B,let me entreat you it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls
p00015_B,00015,B,do you think so i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know
p00016_B,00016,B,you have made her too tall emma
p00017_B,00017,B,it is very pretty so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold
p00018_B,00018,B,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00019_B,00019,B,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness
p00020_B,00020,B,what a precious deposit
p00021_B,00021,B,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can
p00022_B,00022,B,i cannot rate her beauty as you do but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman
p00023_B,00023,B,i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting
p00024_B,00024,B,very well mr elton very well indeed i have read worse charades courtship a very good hint i give you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets the justest that could be given humph harriet s ready wit all the better a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose things must come to a crisis soon now
p00025_B,00025,B,what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman can it be neptune or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out
p00026_B,00026,B,yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in
p00027_B,00027,B,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00028_B,00028,B,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him
p00029_B,00029,B,oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry
p00030_B,00030,B,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much
p00031_B,00031,B,part of my lace is gone and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on
p00032_B,00032,B,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00033_B,00033,B,very much to the honour of both
p00034_B,00034,B,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00035_B,00035,B,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00036_B,00036,B,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00037_B,00037,B,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00038_B,00038,B,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00039_B,00039,B,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00040_B,00040,B,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can
p00041_B,00041,B,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00042_B,00042,B,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately
p00043_B,00043,B,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps
p00044_B,00044,B,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00045_B,00045,B,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords
p00046_B,00046,B,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree
p00047_B,00047,B,john how are you
p00048_B,00048,B,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00049_B,00049,B,oh good mr perry how is he sir
p00050_B,00050,B,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where
p00051_B,00051,B,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00052_B,00052,B,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir
p00053_B,00053,B,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago
p00054_B,00054,B,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00055_B,00055,B,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00056_B,00056,B,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma
p00057_B,00057,B,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet
p00058_B,00058,B,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself
p00059_B,00059,B,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion
p00060_B,00060,B,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night
p00061_B,00061,B,well this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her
p00062_B,00062,B,i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works
p00063_B,00063,B,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it
p00064_B,00064,B,can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable
p00065_B,00065,B,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself
p00066_B,00066,B,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00067_B,00067,B,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him
p00068_B,00068,B,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better
p00069_B,00069,B,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine
p00070_B,00070,B,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00071_B,00071,B,you had better order the carriage directly my love i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold
p00072_B,00072,B,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses
p00073_B,00073,B,i am ready if the others are
p00074_B,00074,B,i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please
p00075_B,00075,B,if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet here have i actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer
p00076_B,00076,B,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00077_B,00077,B,my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now
p00078_B,00078,B,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon
p00079_B,00079,B,she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome
p00080_B,00080,B,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00081_B,00081,B,no you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore
p00082_B,00082,B,miss fairfax is reserved
p00083_B,00083,B,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00084_B,00084,B,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart
p00085_B,00085,B,it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear
p00086_B,00086,B,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you
p00087_B,00087,B,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls
p00088_B,00088,B,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00089_B,00089,B,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00090_B,00090,B,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00091_B,00091,B,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00092_B,00092,B,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00093_B,00093,B,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00094_B,00094,B,who shall answer that question my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind
p00095_B,00095,B,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00096_B,00096,B,when i have seen mr elton i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off
p00097_B,00097,B,yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative
p00098_B,00098,B,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it
p00099_B,00099,B,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford
p00100_B,00100,B,my dear dear anxious friend always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon
p00101_B,00101,B,elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston
p00102_B,00102,B,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00103_B,00103,B,as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name
p00104_B,00104,B,i have heard her speak of the acquaintance she is a very elegant young woman
p00105_B,00105,B,yes
p00106_B,00106,B,you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way
p00107_B,00107,B,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00108_B,00108,B,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00109_B,00109,B,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before
p00110_B,00110,B,and how did you think miss fairfax looking
p00111_B,00111,B,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00112_B,00112,B,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend
p00113_B,00113,B,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play
p00114_B,00114,B,all young people would have their little whims all young people would have their little whims
p00115_B,00115,B,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00116_B,00116,B,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00117_B,00117,B,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party
p00118_B,00118,B,oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up
p00119_B,00119,B,i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly
p00120_B,00120,B,why do you smile
p00121_B,00121,B,nay why do you
p00122_B,00122,B,how they were invited were not they
p00123_B,00123,B,i often feel concern that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose
p00124_B,00124,B,that will do you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet
p00125_B,00125,B,miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her
p00126_B,00126,B,don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine
p00127_B,00127,B,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument
p00128_B,00128,B,do come with me if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it
p00129_B,00129,B,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00130_B,00130,B,no trouble in the world ma am
p00131_B,00131,B,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford
p00132_B,00132,B,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00133_B,00133,B,how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in
p00134_B,00134,B,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00135_B,00135,B,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her
p00136_B,00136,B,you speak too plain she must understand you
p00137_B,00137,B,i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing
p00138_B,00138,B,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00139_B,00139,B,is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing
p00140_B,00140,B,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well
p00141_B,00141,B,well miss woodhouse your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn
p00142_B,00142,B,the crown
p00143_B,00143,B,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house
p00144_B,00144,B,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00145_B,00145,B,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00146_B,00146,B,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00147_B,00147,B,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00148_B,00148,B,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry
p00149_B,00149,B,my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you
p00150_B,00150,B,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00151_B,00151,B,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates
p00152_B,00152,B,but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know
p00153_B,00153,B,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls
p00154_B,00154,B,i certainly must this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes
p00155_B,00155,B,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me
p00156_B,00156,B,elegantly dressed and very pleasing
p00157_B,00157,B,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties
p00158_B,00158,B,well my dear considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane
p00159_B,00159,B,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00160_B,00160,B,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00161_B,00161,B,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness
p00162_B,00162,B,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax
p00163_B,00163,B,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me
p00164_B,00164,B,this is very true at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done
p00165_B,00165,B,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me
p00166_B,00166,B,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before
p00167_B,00167,B,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart
p00168_B,00168,B,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00169_B,00169,B,i never saw any gentleman s handwriting mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw
p00170_B,00170,B,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00171_B,00171,B,he chose to say he was employed
p00172_B,00172,B,oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best
p00173_B,00173,B,but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general
p00174_B,00174,B,oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage
p00175_B,00175,B,yes it is randalls that does it all
p00176_B,00176,B,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts
p00177_B,00177,B,a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better
p00178_B,00178,B,i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of them
p00179_B,00179,B,oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us
p00180_B,00180,B,i did and they cannot forgive me
p00181_B,00181,B,i am ready whenever i am wanted
p00182_B,00182,B,whom are you going to dance with
p00183_B,00183,B,yes i hope i do
p00184_B,00184,B,lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this
p00185_B,00185,B,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment
p00186_B,00186,B,what is this what is this about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you
p00187_B,00187,B,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed
p00188_B,00188,B,miss woodhouse have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again
p00189_B,00189,B,pray emma may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other
p00190_B,00190,B,oh it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves
p00191_B,00191,B,the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade
p00192_B,00192,B,certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone
p00193_B,00193,B,you will soon be cooler if you sit still
p00194_B,00194,B,how much i am obliged to you for telling me to come to day if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again
p00195_B,00195,B,yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come
p00196_B,00196,B,nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people
p00197_B,00197,B,i say nothing of which i am ashamed i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february
p00198_B,00198,B,our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve they shall talk
p00199_B,00199,B,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00200_B,00200,B,it is a sort of thing which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party i never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women
p00201_B,00201,B,very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to you
p00202_B,00202,B,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00203_B,00203,B,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00204_B,00204,B,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00205_B,00205,B,no no it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it
p00206_B,00206,B,i doubt its being very clever myself it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection
p00207_B,00207,B,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00208_B,00208,B,oh for myself i protest i must be excused i really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us
p00209_B,00209,B,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00210_B,00210,B,happy couple how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life
p00211_B,00211,B,such things do occur undoubtedly
p00212_B,00212,B,and make her like myself
p00213_B,00213,B,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p00214_B,00214,B,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p00215_B,00215,B,emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible
p00216_B,00216,B,nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me
p00217_B,00217,B,where may i ask is miss fairfax going
p00218_B,00218,B,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p00219_B,00219,B,well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them
p00220_B,00220,B,i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long
p00221_B,00221,B,well my dear i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me
p00222_B,00222,B,what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be
p00223_B,00223,B,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear
p00224_B,00224,B,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error
p00225_B,00225,B,much indeed if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter
p00226_B,00226,B,harriet poor harriet but with common sense i am afraid i have had little to do
p00227_B,00227,B,oh god that i had never seen her
p00228_B,00228,B,you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you
p00229_B,00229,B,a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable
p00230_B,00230,B,your parish there was small
p00231_B,00231,B,very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted
p00232_B,00232,B,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent
p00233_B,00233,B,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend
p00234_B,00234,B,she has had the advantage you know of practising on me like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan
p00235_B,00235,B,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person
p00236_B,00236,B,perry my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage such an extraordinary dream of mine i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others
p00237_B,00237,B,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting
p00238_B,00238,B,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us
p00239_B,00239,B,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress
p00240_B,00240,B,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends
p00241_B,00241,B,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone
p00242_B,00242,B,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct
p00243_B,00243,B,this is not a very promising beginning after all that i said to her as we came along i thought she would have behaved better i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first i wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper her poor mother had a good deal but we must make allowances for such a child and i do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her for with all its faults it was her home and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better but then there is moderation in all things
p00244_B,00244,B,my dear it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself
p00245_B,00245,B,so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it
p00246_B,00246,B,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift
p00247_B,00247,B,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him
p00248_B,00248,B,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person
p00249_B,00249,B,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls
p00250_B,00250,B,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best
p00251_B,00251,B,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last
p00252_B,00252,B,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson
p00253_B,00253,B,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards
p00254_B,00254,B,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting
p00255_B,00255,B,yes that is very inconvenient indeed it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and demure air you describe so well and nothing was ever juster tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want of them i went down to ramsgate for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend sneyd you have heard me speak of sneyd edmund his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached albion place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier mrs and the two miss sneyds with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs sneyd was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing anything wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with veils and parasols like other girls but i afterwards found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not out and had most excessively offended the eldest miss augusta ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss sneyd i believe has never forgiven me
p00256_B,00256,B,no i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and dines nowhere but with mrs grant and fanny stays at home with her
p00257_B,00257,B,no wonder that mr rushworth should think so at present but depend upon it sotherton will have every improvement in time which his heart can desire
p00258_B,00258,B,your best friend upon such an occasion would be mr repton i imagine
p00259_B,00259,B,well and if they were ten i am sure you need not regard it the expense need not be any impediment if i were you i should not think of the expense i would have everything done in the best style and made as nice as possible such a place as sotherton court deserves everything that taste and money can do you have space to work upon there and grounds that will well reward you for my own part if i had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of sotherton i should be always planting and improving for naturally i am excessively fond of it it would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where i am now with my little half acre it would be quite a burlesque but if i had more room i should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting we did a vast deal in that way at the parsonage we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it you young ones do not remember much about it perhaps but if dear sir thomas were here he could tell you what improvements we made and a great deal more would have been done but for poor mr norris s sad state of health he could hardly ever get out poor man to enjoy anything and that disheartened me from doing several things that sir thomas and i used to talk of if it had not been for that we should have carried on the garden wall and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard just as dr grant has done we were always doing something as it was it was only the spring twelvemonth before mr norris s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall which is now grown such a noble tree and getting to such perfection sir
p00260_B,00260,B,the tree thrives well beyond a doubt madam the soil is good and i never pass it without regretting that the fruit should be so little worth the trouble of gathering
p00261_B,00261,B,the truth is ma am that dr grant hardly knows what the natural taste of our apricot is he is scarcely ever indulged with one for it is so valuable a fruit with a little assistance and ours is such a remarkably large fair sort that what with early tarts and preserves my cook contrives to get them all
p00262_B,00262,B,smith s place is the admiration of all the country and it was a mere nothing before repton took it in hand i think i shall have repton
p00263_B,00263,B,mr rushworth if i were you i would have a very pretty shrubbery one likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine weather
p00264_B,00264,B,the avenue oh i do not recollect it i really know very little of sotherton
p00265_B,00265,B,cut down an avenue what a pity does it not make you think of cowper ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited
p00266_B,00266,B,i am afraid the avenue stands a bad chance fanny
p00267_B,00267,B,the house was built in elizabeth s time and is a large regular brick building heavy but respectable looking and has many good rooms it is ill placed it stands in one of the lowest spots of the park in that respect unfavourable for improvement but the woods are fine and there is a stream which i dare say might be made a good deal of mr rushworth is quite right i think in meaning to give it a modern dress and i have no doubt that it will be all done extremely well
p00268_B,00268,B,it would be delightful to me to see the progress of it all
p00269_B,00269,B,i am very glad that you have heard of it by whatever means and hope there will be no further delay
p00270_B,00270,B,when they are at a distance from all their family they can write long letters
p00271_B,00271,B,miss price has a brother at sea whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think you too severe upon us
p00272_B,00272,B,at sea has she in the king s service of course
p00273_B,00273,B,you are fond of the sort of thing
p00274_B,00274,B,there can be no doubt of mr crawford s willingness but why should not more of us go why should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr rushworth and that would like to hear mr crawford s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so remiss but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs rushworth while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at sotherton just as might be most agreeable to your mother and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr crawford would take my two nieces and me in his barouche and edmund can go on horseback you know sister and fanny will stay at home with you
p00275_B,00275,B,well fanny and how do you like miss crawford now how did you like her yesterday
p00276_B,00276,B,very well very much i like to hear her talk she entertains me and she is so extremely pretty that i have great pleasure in looking at her
p00277_B,00277,B,that is a very foolish trick fanny to be idling away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have no work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new calico that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by cutting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa
p00278_B,00278,B,i must say ma am that fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody in the house
p00279_B,00279,B,fanny i am sure you have the headache i can hardly believe you i know your looks too well how long have you had it
p00280_B,00280,B,since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat
p00281_B,00281,B,go out to be sure she did would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour
p00282_B,00282,B,yes indeed edmund i was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while fanny cut the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the alcove but i declare i quite dreaded the coming home again
p00283_B,00283,B,fanny has been cutting roses has she
p00284_B,00284,B,there was no help for it certainly but i question whether her headache might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar i always forget to have mine filled
p00285_B,00285,B,what has she been walking as well as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head aches
p00286_B,00286,B,oh no i cannot do without fanny
p00287_B,00287,B,besides i know that mr crawford depends upon taking us after what passed at first he would claim it as a promise
p00288_B,00288,B,and my dear edmund taking out two carriages when one will do would be trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and sotherton he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage and you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the varnish scratched off
p00289_B,00289,B,there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the barouche box
p00290_B,00290,B,fanny my dear edmund there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs rushworth so she is not expected
p00291_B,00291,B,to be sure not but i cannot do without her
p00292_B,00292,B,very well very well just as you chuse settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it
p00293_B,00293,B,it seems very odd that you should be staying at home instead of fanny
p00294_B,00294,B,i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you
p00295_B,00295,B,fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires
p00296_B,00296,B,now we shall have no more rough road miss crawford our difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr rushworth has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the parsonage a tidy looking house and i understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people those are almshouses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respectable man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach
p00297_B,00297,B,now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore must be at the back of it mr rushworth talked of the west front
p00298_B,00298,B,i am disappointed this is not my idea of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no aisles no arches no inscriptions no banners no banners cousin to be blown by the night wind of heaven no signs that a
p00299_B,00299,B,you forget fanny how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old chapels of castles and monasteries it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i suppose in the parish church there you must look for the banners and the achievements
p00300_B,00300,B,it is a pity that the custom should have been discontinued it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and chaplain so much in character with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine
p00301_B,00301,B,that is hardly fanny s idea of a family assembling if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom
p00302_B,00302,B,if he would give her away
p00303_B,00303,B,how distressed she will be at what she said just now
p00304_B,00304,B,ordained what are you to be a clergyman
p00305_B,00305,B,query whether we may not find something to employ us here before we go farther i see walls of great promise mr rushworth shall we summon a council on this lawn
p00306_B,00306,B,this is insufferably hot shall any of us object to being comfortable here is a nice little wood if one can but get into it what happiness if the door should not be locked but of course it is for in these great places the gardeners are the only people who can go where they like so you are to be a clergyman mr bertram this is rather a surprise to me
p00307_B,00307,B,why should it surprise you you must suppose me designed for some profession and might perceive that i am neither a lawyer nor a soldier nor a sailor
p00308_B,00308,B,certainly
p00309_B,00309,B,there you have quite convinced miss price already
p00310_B,00310,B,i wish i could convince miss crawford too
p00311_B,00311,B,i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood but the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while
p00312_B,00312,B,thank you but i am not at all tired
p00313_B,00313,B,i shall soon be rested to sit in the shade on a fine day and look upon verdure is the most perfect refreshment
p00314_B,00314,B,now miss crawford if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile
p00315_B,00315,B,it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are so far from the house already
p00316_B,00316,B,you will hurt yourself miss bertram you will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes you will tear your gown you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go
p00317_B,00317,B,thank you my dear fanny but i and my gown are alive and well and so good bye
p00318_B,00318,B,but julia mr rushworth will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr rushworth
p00319_B,00319,B,but that i am sure it has not
p00320_B,00320,B,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors
p00321_B,00321,B,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision
p00322_B,00322,B,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp
p00323_B,00323,B,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it
p00324_B,00324,B,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant
p00325_B,00325,B,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman
p00326_B,00326,B,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night
p00327_B,00327,B,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons
p00328_B,00328,B,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene
p00329_B,00329,B,we want to make a table for mrs rushworth you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him
p00330_B,00330,B,i should be most happy it would give me the greatest pleasure but that i am this moment going to dance come fanny do not be dawdling any longer or the dance will be over
p00331_B,00331,B,a pretty modest request upon my word to want to nail me to a card table for the next two hours with herself and dr grant who are always quarrelling and that poking old woman who knows no more of whist than of algebra i wish my good aunt would be a little less busy and to ask me in such a way too without ceremony before them all so as to leave me no possibility of refusing that is what i dislike most particularly it raises my spleen more than anything to have the pretence of being asked of being given a choice and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing whatever it be if i had not luckily thought of standing up with you i could not have got out of it it is a great deal too bad but when my aunt has got a fancy in her head nothing can stop her
p00332_B,00332,B,an afterpiece instead of a comedy lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady ravenshaw left to act my grandmother by themselves well the jointure may comfort him and perhaps between friends he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make you amends yates i think we must raise a little theatre at mansfield and ask you to be our manager
p00333_B,00333,B,i really believe i could be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from shylock or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be anything or everything as if i could rant and storm or sigh or cut capers in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play an act a scene what should prevent us not these countenances i am sure and for a theatre what signifies a theatre we shall be only amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice
p00334_B,00334,B,we must have a curtain a few yards of green baize for a curtain and perhaps that may be enough
p00335_B,00335,B,oh quite enough with only just a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or four scenes to be let down nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more
p00336_B,00336,B,i believe we must be satisfied with less there would not be time and other difficulties would arise we must rather adopt mr crawford s views and make the performance not the theatre our object many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery
p00337_B,00337,B,nay let us do nothing by halves if we are to act let it be in a theatre completely fitted up with pit boxes and gallery and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so as it be a german play no matter what with a good tricking shifting afterpiece and a figure dance and a hornpipe and a song between the acts if we do not outdo ecclesford we do nothing
p00338_B,00338,B,now edmund do not be disagreeable nobody loves a play better than you do or can have gone much farther to see one
p00339_B,00339,B,such a horribly vile billiard table as ours is not to be met with i believe above ground i can stand it no longer and i think i may say that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again but one good thing i have just ascertained it is the very room for a theatre precisely the shape and length for it and the doors at the farther end communicating with each other as they may be made to do in five minutes by merely moving the bookcase in my father s room is the very thing we could have desired if we had sat down to wish for it and my father s room will be an excellent greenroom it seems to join the billiard room on purpose
p00340_B,00340,B,by jove this won t do to be sure my dear mother your anxiety i was unlucky there
p00341_B,00341,B,but this i will maintain that we shall be doing no harm
p00342_B,00342,B,i cannot agree with you i am convinced that my father would totally disapprove it
p00343_B,00343,B,this will never do we are wasting time most abominably something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many must not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making anything of it from this moment i make no difficulties i take any part you chuse to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the ravenshaws how came it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here are two capital tragic parts for yates and crawford and here is the rhyming butler for me if nobody else wants it a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and as i said before i am determined to take anything and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by anybody it is only count cassel and anhalt
p00344_B,00344,B,this is not behaving well by the absent here are not women enough amelia and agatha may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your sister mr crawford
p00345_B,00345,B,i must entreat miss julia bertram not to engage in the part of agatha or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity you must not indeed you must not i could not stand your countenance dressed up in woe and paleness the many laughs we have had together would infallibly come across me and frederick and his knapsack would be obliged to run away
p00346_B,00346,B,cottager s wife what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest commonplace not a tolerable speech in the whole your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at ecclesford the governess was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else a little more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better
p00347_B,00347,B,with all your partiality for cottager s wife it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer her good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her to accept the part she must not be left to her own complaisance her talents will be wanted in amelia amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented than even agatha i consider amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece it requires great powers great nicety to give her playfulness and simplicity without extravagance i have seen good actresses fail in the part simplicity indeed is beyond the reach of almost every actress by profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not it requires a gentlewoman a julia bertram you will undertake it i hope
p00348_B,00348,B,you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions though one might have supposed but it is only as agatha that i was to be so overpowering
p00349_B,00349,B,miss crawford must be amelia she will be an excellent amelia
p00350_B,00350,B,i am sure i would give up the part to julia most willingly but that though i shall probably do it very ill i feel persuaded she would do it worse
p00351_B,00351,B,yes after all our debatings and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so unexceptionable as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have all the advantage of what i saw at ecclesford and it is so useful to have anything of a model we have cast almost every part
p00352_B,00352,B,i take the part which lady ravenshaw was to have done and miss crawford is to be amelia
p00353_B,00353,B,i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s something is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak
p00354_B,00354,B,we see things very differently i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few omissions and so forth which will be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and i am not the only young woman you find who thinks it very fit for private representation
p00355_B,00355,B,do not act anything improper my dear sir thomas would not like it fanny ring the bell i must have my dinner to be sure julia is dressed by this time
p00356_B,00356,B,if i were to decline the part julia would certainly take it
p00357_B,00357,B,what if she knew your reasons
p00358_B,00358,B,i was just going to say the very same thing if every play is to be objected to you will act nothing and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away and i am sure that would be a discredit to us all i do not know the play but as maria says if there is anything a little too warm and it is so with most of them it can be easily left out we must not be over precise edmund as mr rushworth is to act too there can be no harm i only wish tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began for there was the loss of half a day s work about those side doors the curtain will be a good job however the maids do their work very well and i think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings there is no occasion to put them so very close together i am of some use i hope in preventing waste and making the most of things there should always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones i forgot to tell tom of something that happened to me this very day i had been looking about me in the poultry yard and was just coming out when who should i see but dick jackson making up to the servants hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand bringing them to father you may be sure mother had chanced to send him of a message to father and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board for he could not no how do without them i knew what all this meant for the servants dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads and as i hate such encroaching people the jacksons are very encroaching i have always said so just the sort of people to get all they can i said to the boy directly a great lubberly fellow of ten years old you know who ought to be ashamed of himself i ll take the boards to your father dick so get you home again as fast as you can the boy looked very silly and turned away without offering a word for i believe i might speak pretty sharp and i dare say it will cure him of coming marauding about the house for one while i hate such greediness so good as your father is to the family employing the man all the year round
p00359_B,00359,B,my good friends you are most composedly at work upon these cottages and alehouses inside and out but pray let me know my fate in the meanwhile who is to be anhalt what gentleman among you am i to have the pleasure of making love to
p00360_B,00360,B,i had my choice of the parts but i thought i should like the count best though i do not much relish the finery i am to have
p00361_B,00361,B,you chose very wisely i am sure anhalt is a heavy part
p00362_B,00362,B,i should be but too happy in taking the part if it were possible but unluckily the butler and anhalt are in together i will not entirely give it up however i will try what can be done i will look it over again
p00363_B,00363,B,your brother should take the part do not you think he would
p00364_B,00364,B,me indeed you must excuse me i could not act anything if you were to give me the world no indeed i cannot act
p00365_B,00365,B,if you are afraid of half a dozen speeches what would you do with such a part as mine i have forty two to learn
p00366_B,00366,B,it is not that i am afraid of learning by heart but i really cannot act
p00367_B,00367,B,yes yes you can act well enough for us learn your part and we will teach you all the rest you have only two scenes and as i shall be cottager i ll put you in and push you about and you will do it very well i ll answer for it
p00368_B,00368,B,what a piece of work here is about nothing i am quite ashamed of you fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you take the part with a good grace and let us hear no more of the matter i entreat
p00369_B,00369,B,do not urge her madam it is not fair to urge her in this manner you see she does not like to act let her chuse for herself as well as the rest of us her judgment may be quite as safely trusted do not urge her any more
p00370_B,00370,B,i do not like my situation this place is too hot for me
p00371_B,00371,B,never mind my dear miss price this is a cross evening everybody is cross and teasing but do not let us mind them
p00372_B,00372,B,the mansfield theatricals would enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly
p00373_B,00373,B,come in
p00374_B,00374,B,i believe there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once
p00375_B,00375,B,have i i will do my best with the greatest readiness but i must read the part for i can say very little of it
p00376_B,00376,B,dr grant is ill he has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the pheasant today he fancied it tough sent away his plate and has been suffering ever since
p00377_B,00377,B,do fanny if it is not very disagreeable to you
p00378_B,00378,B,you have only to read the part
p00379_B,00379,B,and i do believe she can say every word of it for she could put mrs grant right the other day in twenty places fanny i am sure you know the part
p00380_B,00380,B,shall i go too had not i better go too will not it be right for me to go too
p00381_B,00381,B,how do you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting
p00382_B,00382,B,indeed and what have you been acting
p00383_B,00383,B,the all will soon be told but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now you will hear enough of it to morrow sir we have just been trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the 3rd tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting anything since the first day i went over mansfield wood and edmund took the copses beyond easton and we brought home six brace between us and might each have killed six times as many but we respect your pheasants sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than they were i never saw mansfield wood so full of pheasants in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon
p00384_B,00384,B,something must be done
p00385_B,00385,B,it is time to think of our visitors where did you leave miss crawford fanny
p00386_B,00386,B,then poor yates is all alone i will go and fetch him he will be no bad assistant when it all comes out
p00387_B,00387,B,oh not to him look so to all the others but not to him
p00388_B,00388,B,to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not unsuccessfully upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the crawfords being gone home that nothing more can be done to night but if you will give us the honour of your company to morrow evening i should not be afraid of the result we bespeak your indulgence you understand as young performers we bespeak your indulgence
p00389_B,00389,B,mr crawford was a most pleasant gentleman like man his sister a sweet pretty elegant lively girl
p00390_B,00390,B,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing
p00391_B,00391,B,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight
p00392_B,00392,B,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish
p00393_B,00393,B,if i had not been active and made a point of being introduced to his mother and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit i am as certain as i sit here that nothing would have come of it for mr rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle but i left no stone unturned i was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister and at last i did persuade her you know the distance to sotherton it was in the middle of winter and the roads almost impassable but i did persuade her
p00394_B,00394,B,i know how great how justly great your influence is with lady bertram and her children and am the more concerned that it should not have been
p00395_B,00395,B,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father
p00396_B,00396,B,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home
p00397_B,00397,B,but they are passed over i have been watching them this weather is all from the south
p00398_B,00398,B,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again
p00399_B,00399,B,they cannot have been sitting long for when i went up for my shawl i saw them from the staircase window and then they were walking
p00400_B,00400,B,upon my word you are two of the most disappointing and unfeeling kind friends i ever met with there is no giving you a moment s uneasiness you do not know how much we have been suffering nor what chills we have felt but i have long thought mr bertram one of the worst subjects to work on in any little manoeuvre against common sense that a woman could be plagued with i had very little hope of him from the first but you mrs grant my sister my own sister i think i had a right to alarm you a little
p00401_B,00401,B,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close
p00402_B,00402,B,you intend to be very rich
p00403_B,00403,B,and you know what your dinner will be the turkey and i assure you a very fine one for my dear cook insists upon the turkey s being dressed to morrow
p00404_B,00404,B,if you put such a question to her fanny will immediately say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not
p00405_B,00405,B,if you cannot do without me ma am
p00406_B,00406,B,but my mother will have my father with her all the evening
p00407_B,00407,B,to be sure so i shall
p00408_B,00408,B,sir thomas stop a moment i have something to say to you
p00409_B,00409,B,well
p00410_B,00410,B,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister
p00411_B,00411,B,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence
p00412_B,00412,B,but can i do without her sir thomas
p00413_B,00413,B,well fanny it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go
p00414_B,00414,B,and yet why should i be glad for am i not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me
p00415_B,00415,B,yes sir
p00416_B,00416,B,quite unnecessary a great deal too kind but edmund goes true it is upon edmund s account i observed he was hoarse on thursday night
p00417_B,00417,B,never happier never happier than when doing what you must know was not justifiable never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and unfeelingly oh what a corrupted mind
p00418_B,00418,B,those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss
p00419_B,00419,B,bertram i shall make a point of coming to mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young beginner when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time as i shall do not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence preeminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with tablets and a pencil when will it be you must preach at mansfield you know that sir thomas and lady bertram may hear you
p00420_B,00420,B,will he not feel this no he can feel nothing as he ought
p00421_B,00421,B,and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the intermediate days and what do you think it is
p00422_B,00422,B,what shall i do sir thomas whist and speculation which will amuse me most very well then speculation if you please mrs grant i know nothing about it but fanny must teach me
p00423_B,00423,B,bertram i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home i told you i lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck for i never do wrong without gaining by it i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field in the midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills a small stream before me to be forded a church standing on a sort of knoll to my right which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentleman or half a gentleman s house to be seen excepting one to be presumed the parsonage within a stone s throw of the said knoll and church i found myself in short in thornton lacey
p00424_B,00424,B,it sounds like it but which way did you turn after passing sewell s farm
p00425_B,00425,B,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it
p00426_B,00426,B,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours
p00427_B,00427,B,and fanny had much rather it were william s poor fanny not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes
p00428_B,00428,B,mr bertram you know henry to be such a capital improver that you cannot possibly engage in anything of the sort at thornton lacey without accepting his help only think how useful he was at sotherton only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take fire there we went and there we came home again and what was done there is not to be told
p00429_B,00429,B,i cannot say there was much done at sotherton but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered
p00430_B,00430,B,i should be sorry to have my powers of planning judged of by the day at sotherton i see things very differently now do not think of me as i appeared then
p00431_B,00431,B,sotherton yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs rushworth will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr rushworth is a most amiable man they are at brighton now you know in one of the best houses there as mr rushworth s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to portsmouth if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins
p00432_B,00432,B,i do not advise your going to brighton william as i trust you may soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting but my daughters would be happy to see their cousins anywhere and you will find mr rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our family as his own
p00433_B,00433,B,i want to be your neighbour sir thomas as you have perhaps heard me telling miss price may i hope for your acquiescence and for your not influencing your son against such a tenant
p00434_B,00434,B,but you do not wish yourself at portsmouth william
p00435_B,00435,B,i am sorry to say that i am unable to answer your question i have never seen fanny dance since she was a little girl but i trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a gentlewoman when we do see her which perhaps we may have an opportunity of doing ere long
p00436_B,00436,B,i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance mr price and will engage to answer every inquiry which you can make on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i believe it must be at some other time there is one person in company who does not like to have miss price spoken of
p00437_B,00437,B,come fanny fanny what are you about we are going do not you see your aunt is going quick quick i cannot bear to keep good old wilcox waiting you should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and edmund and william
p00438_B,00438,B,i do not like william that you should leave northamptonshire without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at northampton your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue would be too much for your aunt i believe we must not think of a northampton ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if
p00439_B,00439,B,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were
p00440_B,00440,B,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond
p00441_B,00441,B,perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to morrow he says he has business there but will not tell me what the first time he ever denied me his confidence but this is what we all come to all are supplanted sooner or later now i must apply to you for information pray what is henry going for well then i must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother and of talking of you by the way
p00442_B,00442,B,oh william
p00443_B,00443,B,what did she think of being up before you set off
p00444_B,00444,B,yes half past nine and i shall be punctual for there will be no kind sister to get up for me
p00445_B,00445,B,i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time and his own very different to morrow
p00446_B,00446,B,and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight in crib you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you
p00447_B,00447,B,we miss our two young men and there is no reason to suppose but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to edmund we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done
p00448_B,00448,B,yes but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home sir thomas i have been thinking and i am very glad we took fanny as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it
p00449_B,00449,B,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it
p00450_B,00450,B,my dear henry where can you have been all this time sitting with them an hour and a half
p00451_B,00451,B,i must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them i will not talk of my own happiness great as it is for i think only of yours compared with you who has a right to be happy i have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this morning but there has not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the subject i will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having it finished while i was in london i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands i left the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pass before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him i would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend as this day does prove it now i may say that even i could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together
p00452_B,00452,B,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line
p00453_B,00453,B,oh yes certainly i will write directly
p00454_B,00454,B,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power
p00455_B,00455,B,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that
p00456_B,00456,B,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps
p00457_B,00457,B,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well
p00458_B,00458,B,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk
p00459_B,00459,B,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise
p00460_B,00460,B,no
p00461_B,00461,B,what did that shake of the head mean what was it meant to express disapprobation i fear but of what what had i been saying to displease you did you think me speaking improperly lightly irreverently on the subject only tell me if i was only tell me if i was wrong i want to be set right nay nay i entreat you for one moment put down your work what did that shake of the head mean
p00462_B,00462,B,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can
p00463_B,00463,B,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend
p00464_B,00464,B,to be sure i had much rather she had stayed in harbour that i might have sat a few hours with you in comfort but as there is a boat ashore i had better go off at once and there is no help for it whereabouts does the thrush lay at spithead near the canopus but no matter here s fanny in the parlour and why should we stay in the passage come mother you have hardly looked at your own dear fanny yet
p00465_B,00465,B,ha that s just where i should have put her myself it s the best berth at spithead but here is my sister sir here is fanny it is so dark you do not see her
p00466_B,00466,B,her year i am sure i hope i shall be rid of her before she has staid a year for that will not be up till november servants are come to such a pass my dear in portsmouth that it is quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year i have no hope of ever being settled and if i was to part with rebecca i should only get something worse and yet i do not think i am a very difficult mistress to please and i am sure the place is easy enough for there is always a girl under her and i often do half the work myself
p00467_B,00467,B,what have you got there my love come and shew it to me
p00468_B,00468,B,you have been here a month i think
p00469_B,00469,B,no not quite a month it is only four weeks to morrow since i left mansfield
p00470_B,00470,B,i wish you were not so tired i wish i left you in stronger health is there anything i can do for you in town i have half an idea of going into norfolk again soon i am not satisfied about maddison i am sure he still means to impose on me if possible and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill which i design for somebody else i must come to an understanding with him i must make him know that i will not be tricked on the south side of everingham any more than on the north that i will be master of my own property i was not explicit enough with him before the mischief such a man does on an estate both as to the credit of his employer and the welfare of the poor is inconceivable i have a great mind to go back into norfolk directly and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards swerved from maddison is a clever fellow i do not wish to displace him provided he does not try to displace me but it would be simple to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me and worse than simple to let him give me a hard hearted griping fellow for a tenant instead of an honest man to whom i have given half a promise already would it not be worse than simple shall i go do you advise it
p00471_B,00471,B,i advise you know very well what is right
p00472_B,00472,B,rushworth sir
p00473_B,00473,B,indeed i hope it is not true it would be so very shocking if i have spoken once to rebecca about that carpet i am sure i have spoke at least a dozen times have not i betsey and it would not be ten minutes work
p00474_B,00474,B,and what what could you say cruel quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty
p00475_B,00475,B,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p00476_B,00476,B,very agreeable indeed
p00477_B,00477,B,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p00478_B,00478,B,we shall do better another evening i hope
p00479_B,00479,B,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p00480_B,00480,B,how can you be so
p00481_B,00481,B,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p00482_B,00482,B,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p00483_B,00483,B,i was not thinking of anything
p00484_B,00484,B,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p00485_B,00485,B,my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age
p00486_B,00486,B,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p00487_B,00487,B,five and twenty if it is an inch
p00488_B,00488,B,he does look very hot to be sure
p00489_B,00489,B,you will find however miss morland it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people for i might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day jackson of oriel bid me sixty at once morland was with me at the time
p00490_B,00490,B,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p00491_B,00491,B,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p00492_B,00492,B,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00493_B,00493,B,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p00494_B,00494,B,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p00495_B,00495,B,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p00496_B,00496,B,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00497_B,00497,B,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p00498_B,00498,B,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p00499_B,00499,B,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p00500_B,00500,B,very agreeable madam
p00501_B,00501,B,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p00502_B,00502,B,no where is he
p00503_B,00503,B,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p00504_B,00504,B,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p00505_B,00505,B,what do you mean where are you all going to
p00506_B,00506,B,do just as you please my dear
p00507_B,00507,B,you will not be frightened miss morland if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him old allen is as rich as a jew is not he old allen the man you are with
p00508_B,00508,B,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p00509_B,00509,B,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p00510_B,00510,B,how well your brother dances
p00511_B,00511,B,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p00512_B,00512,B,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p00513_B,00513,B,but they are such very different things
p00514_B,00514,B,how handsome a family they are
p00515_B,00515,B,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p00516_B,00516,B,blaize castle what is that
p00517_B,00517,B,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00518_B,00518,B,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p00519_B,00519,B,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p00520_B,00520,B,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p00521_B,00521,B,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00522_B,00522,B,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00523_B,00523,B,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p00524_B,00524,B,who where
p00525_B,00525,B,it is all one to me
p00526_B,00526,B,if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own
p00527_B,00527,B,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p00528_B,00528,B,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p00529_B,00529,B,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00530_B,00530,B,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p00531_B,00531,B,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p00532_B,00532,B,how came mr thorpe to know your father
p00533_B,00533,B,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00534_B,00534,B,no no no
p00535_B,00535,B,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00536_B,00536,B,catherine you must go
p00537_B,00537,B,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p00538_B,00538,B,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00539_B,00539,B,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00540_B,00540,B,i suspect there is no great struggle
p00541_B,00541,B,you have not
p00542_B,00542,B,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00543_B,00543,B,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00544_B,00544,B,let her go let her go if she will go
p00545_B,00545,B,she is as obstinate as
p00546_B,00546,B,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p00547_B,00547,B,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p00548_B,00548,B,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p00549_B,00549,B,that is just what i was going to say
p00550_B,00550,B,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p00551_B,00551,B,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00552_B,00552,B,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p00553_B,00553,B,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00554_B,00554,B,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00555_B,00555,B,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00556_B,00556,B,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p00557_B,00557,B,to say the truth i do not much like any other
p00558_B,00558,B,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p00559_B,00559,B,indeed and of what nature
p00560_B,00560,B,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00561_B,00561,B,riot what riot
p00562_B,00562,B,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p00563_B,00563,B,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p00564_B,00564,B,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p00565_B,00565,B,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p00566_B,00566,B,indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it
p00567_B,00567,B,shall not you be late at devizes
p00568_B,00568,B,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil
p00569_B,00569,B,then why did not you
p00570_B,00570,B,it is very charming indeed
p00571_B,00571,B,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00572_B,00572,B,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p00573_B,00573,B,by the end of another week
p00574_B,00574,B,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p00575_B,00575,B,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p00576_B,00576,B,but how can that be are not you with her
p00577_B,00577,B,how much better is this how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one
p00578_B,00578,B,is it a pretty place
p00579_B,00579,B,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p00580_B,00580,B,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p00581_B,00581,B,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p00582_B,00582,B,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now
p00583_B,00583,B,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p00584_B,00584,B,it remains as it was i suppose
p00585_B,00585,B,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p00586_B,00586,B,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p00587_B,00587,B,what was her father
p00588_B,00588,B,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00589_B,00589,B,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p00590_B,00590,B,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p00591_B,00591,B,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story
p00592_B,00592,B,but he will tell only half of it
p00593_B,00593,B,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days
p00594_B,00594,B,go away and why
p00595_B,00595,B,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p00596_B,00596,B,it will soon be as if you never had
p00597_B,00597,B,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p00598_B,00598,B,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p00599_B,00599,B,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping
p00600_B,00600,B,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00601_B,00601,B,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p00602_B,00602,B,i really have not patience with the general only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first
p00603_B,00603,B,yes but that did not last long
p00604_B,00604,B,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p00605_B,00605,B,her head did not run upon bath much
p00606_B,00606,B,he would be a very lucky man shepherd that s all i have to remark a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd
p00607_B,00607,B,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected
p00608_B,00608,B,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him
p00609_B,00609,B,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
p00610_B,00610,B,the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it
p00611_B,00611,B,indeed
p00612_B,00612,B,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young
p00613_B,00613,B,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years
p00614_B,00614,B,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother
p00615_B,00615,B,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent
p00616_B,00616,B,you mean mr wentworth i suppose
p00617_B,00617,B,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common
p00618_B,00618,B,a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here
p00619_B,00619,B,mrs clay never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles
p00620_B,00620,B,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
p00621_B,00621,B,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen
p00622_B,00622,B,but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm of the shock you will not be hysterical again i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province a sick child is always the mother s property her own feelings generally make it so
p00623_B,00623,B,i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday
p00624_B,00624,B,captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again
p00625_B,00625,B,but captain wentworth how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you
p00626_B,00626,B,i knew pretty well what she was before that day i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself ah she was a dear old asp to me she did all that i wanted i knew she would i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition four and twenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me
p00627_B,00627,B,and so then i suppose so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy charles my dear do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother i always forgot
p00628_B,00628,B,it was at gibraltar mother i know dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth
p00629_B,00629,B,ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia how fast i made money in her a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands poor harville sister you know how much he wanted money worse than myself he had a wife excellent fellow i shall never forget his happiness he felt it all so much for her sake i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean
p00630_B,00630,B,if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters
p00631_B,00631,B,should i i am glad i was not a week later then but if i know myself this is from no want of gallantry towards them it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it
p00632_B,00632,B,oh frederick but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether
p00633_B,00633,B,ah my dear when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife
p00634_B,00634,B,now i have done
p00635_B,00635,B,when once married people begin to attack me with oh you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it
p00636_B,00636,B,pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies
p00637_B,00637,B,and i do assure you ma am that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared thank god i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me a little disordered always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience
p00638_B,00638,B,aye to be sure yes indeed oh yes i am quite of your opinion mrs croft there is nothing so bad as a separation i am quite of your opinion i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again
p00639_B,00639,B,upon my word it would dear me if he should rise to any very great honours if he should ever be made a baronet lady wentworth sounds very well that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that sir frederick and lady wentworth it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations you know i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them and pray who is charles hayter nothing but a country curate a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross
p00640_B,00640,B,walter get down this moment you are extremely troublesome i am very angry with you
p00641_B,00641,B,walter why do you not do as you are bid do not you hear your aunt speak come to me walter come to cousin charles you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
p00642_B,00642,B,is not this one of the ways to winthrop
p00643_B,00643,B,bless me here is winthrop i declare i had no idea well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired
p00644_B,00644,B,no
p00645_B,00645,B,no no
p00646_B,00646,B,oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good
p00647_B,00647,B,it is very unpleasant having such connexions but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life
p00648_B,00648,B,and so i made her go i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense what would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance
p00649_B,00649,B,she would have turned back then but for you
p00650_B,00650,B,bless me it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed charles anne must not it in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be how very extraordinary in the very same inn with us anne must not it be our mr elliot my father s next heir pray sir did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family
p00651_B,00651,B,putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin
p00652_B,00652,B,no that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand
p00653_B,00653,B,is there no one to help me
p00654_B,00654,B,go to him go to him for heaven s sake go to him i can support her myself leave me and go to him rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them
p00655_B,00655,B,anne anne what is to be done next what in heaven s name is to be done next
p00656_B,00656,B,yes yes to the inn i will carry her myself musgrove take care of the others
p00657_B,00657,B,thank god
p00658_B,00658,B,i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it
p00659_B,00659,B,i must see captain benwick before i decide
p00660_B,00660,B,and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon so i give you notice lady russell
p00661_B,00661,B,oh as to being anne s acquaintance i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
p00662_B,00662,B,there we differ mary i think lady russell would like him i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner
p00663_B,00663,B,so do i anne i am sure lady russell would like him he is just lady russell s sort give him a book and he will read all day long
p00664_B,00664,B,yes that he will he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops one s scissors or anything that happens do you think lady russell would like that
p00665_B,00665,B,upon my word i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions i wish he may be induced to call here and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand
p00666_B,00666,B,i hope i shall remember in future not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays
p00667_B,00667,B,oh when shall i leave you again
p00668_B,00668,B,that must not be any reason indeed i assure you i feel it none she is nothing to me compared with you
p00669_B,00669,B,my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification
p00670_B,00670,B,it was an acquaintance worth having
p00671_B,00671,B,my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company
p00672_B,00672,B,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for
p00673_B,00673,B,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
p00674_B,00674,B,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged
p00675_B,00675,B,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
p00676_B,00676,B,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name
p00677_B,00677,B,mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him but we should not suit
p00678_B,00678,B,they come on the admiral s account he is thought to be gouty
p00679_B,00679,B,gout and decrepitude poor old gentleman
p00680_B,00680,B,have they any acquaintance here
p00681_B,00681,B,i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this
p00682_B,00682,B,i suspect that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place
p00683_B,00683,B,oh no i think not situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours we had better leave the crofts to find their own level there are several odd looking men walking about here who i am told are sailors the crofts will associate with them
p00684_B,00684,B,none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together i am going home
p00685_B,00685,B,how do you do
p00686_B,00686,B,this is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar
p00687_B,00687,B,is not this song worth staying for
p00688_B,00688,B,very well i have nothing to send but my love oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out lady russell quite bores one with her new publications you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert something so formal and arrang in her air and she sits so upright my best love of course
p00689_B,00689,B,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both
p00690_B,00690,B,no it cannot be mr elliot i assure you he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till to morrow
p00691_B,00691,B,well mother i have done something for you that you will like i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night a n t i a good boy i know you love a play and there is room for us all it holds nine i have engaged captain wentworth anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure we all like a play have not i done well mother
p00692_B,00692,B,good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing take a box for to morrow night have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them how can you be so forgetful
p00693_B,00693,B,we had better put it off charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us
p00694_B,00694,B,if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you but it had better not be attempted perhaps
p00695_B,00695,B,that is precisely what i was going to observe i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement i always think that no mutual
p00696_B,00696,B,have you finished your letter
p00697_B,00697,B,perhaps i shall yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands i will not allow books to prove anything
p00698_B,00698,B,yes very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute i know you will not be sorry to be off i shall be at your service in half a minute
p00699_B,00699,B,good morning god bless you
p00700_B,00700,B,by all means my dear go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself charles ring and order a chair she must not walk
p00701_B,00701,B,i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both
p00702_B,00702,B,captain wentworth which way are you going only to gay street or farther up the town
p00703_B,00703,B,you should have distinguished you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated
p00704_B,00704,B,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
p00705_B,00705,B,we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes since we are not to visit
p00706_B,00706,B,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p00707_B,00707,B,no more have i and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
p00708_B,00708,B,i do not cough for my own amusement
p00709_B,00709,B,to morrow fortnight
p00710_B,00710,B,aye so it is and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself
p00711_B,00711,B,then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her
p00712_B,00712,B,oh i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest
p00713_B,00713,B,are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
p00714_B,00714,B,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable
p00715_B,00715,B,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
p00716_B,00716,B,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p00717_B,00717,B,i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him
p00718_B,00718,B,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p00719_B,00719,B,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p00720_B,00720,B,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p00721_B,00721,B,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p00722_B,00722,B,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
p00723_B,00723,B,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
p00724_B,00724,B,did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton
p00725_B,00725,B,it will be her turn soon to be teazed i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
p00726_B,00726,B,certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance
p00727_B,00727,B,my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you
p00728_B,00728,B,i should imagine not
p00729_B,00729,B,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p00730_B,00730,B,it is from miss bingley
p00731_B,00731,B,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p00732_B,00732,B,dining out that is very unlucky
p00733_B,00733,B,can i have the carriage
p00734_B,00734,B,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p00735_B,00735,B,i had much rather go in the coach
p00736_B,00736,B,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p00737_B,00737,B,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p00738_B,00738,B,this was a lucky idea of mine indeed
p00739_B,00739,B,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders
p00740_B,00740,B,i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
p00741_B,00741,B,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p00742_B,00742,B,i admire the activity of your benevolence but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
p00743_B,00743,B,if we make haste perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes
p00744_B,00744,B,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p00745_B,00745,B,you observed it mr darcy i am sure and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition
p00746_B,00746,B,certainly not
p00747_B,00747,B,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p00748_B,00748,B,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p00749_B,00749,B,i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
p00750_B,00750,B,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p00751_B,00751,B,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p00752_B,00752,B,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p00753_B,00753,B,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p00754_B,00754,B,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p00755_B,00755,B,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p00756_B,00756,B,i am astonished that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy
p00757_B,00757,B,it ought to be good it has been the work of many generations
p00758_B,00758,B,i wish it may
p00759_B,00759,B,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p00760_B,00760,B,it is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are
p00761_B,00761,B,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p00762_B,00762,B,nor i i am sure
p00763_B,00763,B,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p00764_B,00764,B,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
p00765_B,00765,B,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p00766_B,00766,B,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any
p00767_B,00767,B,eliza bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
p00768_B,00768,B,undoubtedly there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
p00769_B,00769,B,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p00770_B,00770,B,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p00771_B,00771,B,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p00772_B,00772,B,whatever i do is done in a hurry and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
p00773_B,00773,B,that is exactly what i should have supposed of you
p00774_B,00774,B,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p00775_B,00775,B,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p00776_B,00776,B,yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage
p00777_B,00777,B,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p00778_B,00778,B,yes indeed i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all
p00779_B,00779,B,did charlotte dine with you
p00780_B,00780,B,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
p00781_B,00781,B,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p00782_B,00782,B,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p00783_B,00783,B,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p00784_B,00784,B,how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter you write uncommonly fast
p00785_B,00785,B,you are mistaken i write rather slowly
p00786_B,00786,B,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p00787_B,00787,B,my style of writing is very different from yours
p00788_B,00788,B,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p00789_B,00789,B,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p00790_B,00790,B,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p00791_B,00791,B,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast
p00792_B,00792,B,and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
p00793_B,00793,B,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself
p00794_B,00794,B,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could
p00795_B,00795,B,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
p00796_B,00796,B,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you
p00797_B,00797,B,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do
p00798_B,00798,B,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter
p00799_B,00799,B,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel
p00800_B,00800,B,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue
p00801_B,00801,B,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye
p00802_B,00802,B,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure
p00803_B,00803,B,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
p00804_B,00804,B,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
p00805_B,00805,B,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
p00806_B,00806,B,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
p00807_B,00807,B,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done
p00808_B,00808,B,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
p00809_B,00809,B,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p00810_B,00810,B,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise
p00811_B,00811,B,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
p00812_B,00812,B,do let us have a little music louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst
p00813_B,00813,B,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p00814_B,00814,B,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p00815_B,00815,B,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p00816_B,00816,B,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed
p00817_B,00817,B,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly
p00818_B,00818,B,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p00819_B,00819,B,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p00820_B,00820,B,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
p00821_B,00821,B,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
p00822_B,00822,B,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long
p00823_B,00823,B,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
p00824_B,00824,B,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
p00825_B,00825,B,heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil
p00826_B,00826,B,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent
p00827_B,00827,B,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
p00828_B,00828,B,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
p00829_B,00829,B,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself
p00830_B,00830,B,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon
p00831_B,00831,B,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
p00832_B,00832,B,for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing
p00833_B,00833,B,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs
p00834_B,00834,B,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p00835_B,00835,B,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
p00836_B,00836,B,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them
p00837_B,00837,B,oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her
p00838_B,00838,B,come here child i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true very well and this offer of marriage you have refused
p00839_B,00839,B,yes or i will never see her again
p00840_B,00840,B,pray do my dear miss lucas for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves
p00841_B,00841,B,my dear madam let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise
p00842_B,00842,B,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
p00843_B,00843,B,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
p00844_B,00844,B,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune
p00845_B,00845,B,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before
p00846_B,00846,B,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary
p00847_B,00847,B,oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment
p00848_B,00848,B,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter
p00849_B,00849,B,a little
p00850_B,00850,B,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
p00851_B,00851,B,we are speaking of music madam
p00852_B,00852,B,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p00853_B,00853,B,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
p00854_B,00854,B,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
p00855_B,00855,B,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p00856_B,00856,B,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact
p00857_B,00857,B,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
p00858_B,00858,B,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p00859_B,00859,B,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done
p00860_B,00860,B,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution
p00861_B,00861,B,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
p00862_B,00862,B,perfectly so i thank you
p00863_B,00863,B,i did not know before that you ever walked this way
p00864_B,00864,B,and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her
p00865_B,00865,B,i know not miss elizabeth whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other
p00866_B,00866,B,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
p00867_B,00867,B,a great many indeed
p00868_B,00868,B,but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side
p00869_B,00869,B,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book
p00870_B,00870,B,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him
p00871_B,00871,B,i am sure i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart
p00872_B,00872,B,and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
p00873_B,00873,B,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
p00874_B,00874,B,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
p00875_B,00875,B,nearly three weeks
p00876_B,00876,B,a little
p00877_B,00877,B,and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother
p00878_B,00878,B,except when she goes to ramsgate
p00879_B,00879,B,if your master would marry you might see more of him
p00880_B,00880,B,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p00881_B,00881,B,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p00882_B,00882,B,can this be mr darcy
p00883_B,00883,B,his father was an excellent man
p00884_B,00884,B,in what an amiable light does this place him
p00885_B,00885,B,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
p00886_B,00886,B,what will be his surprise when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me
p00887_B,00887,B,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming
p00888_B,00888,B,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it
p00889_B,00889,B,yes but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
p00890_B,00890,B,and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was
p00891_B,00891,B,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk
p00892_B,00892,B,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p00893_B,00893,B,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland
p00894_B,00894,B,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
p00895_B,00895,B,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever
p00896_B,00896,B,a gamester this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it
p00897_B,00897,B,and lydia used to want to go to london
p00898_B,00898,B,this is a parade which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away
p00899_B,00899,B,i am not going to run away papa if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
p00900_B,00900,B,what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
p00901_B,00901,B,oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
p00902_B,00902,B,then it is as i always hoped they are married
p00903_B,00903,B,is it possible can it be possible that he will marry her
p00904_B,00904,B,no but it must be done soon
p00905_B,00905,B,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p00906_B,00906,B,i dislike it very much but it must be done
p00907_B,00907,B,and may i ask but the terms i suppose must be complied with
p00908_B,00908,B,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p00909_B,00909,B,that is very true though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
p00910_B,00910,B,and they are really to be married how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia
p00911_B,00911,B,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds
p00912_B,00912,B,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p00913_B,00913,B,i will go to meryton as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding
p00914_B,00914,B,i thank you for my share of the favour but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
p00915_B,00915,B,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p00916_B,00916,B,oh certainly we will ask you no questions
p00917_B,00917,B,thank you for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry
p00918_B,00918,B,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p00919_B,00919,B,i often think that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them
p00920_B,00920,B,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p00921_B,00921,B,well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
p00922_B,00922,B,i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but don t imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks
p00923_B,00923,B,yet it is hard that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself
p00924_B,00924,B,let me first see how he behaves it will then be early enough for expectation could i expect it to be otherwise yet why did he come
p00925_B,00925,B,now that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance
p00926_B,00926,B,if he does not come to me then i shall give him up for ever a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings
p00927_B,00927,B,you are very cruel you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment
p00928_B,00928,B,we may as well leave them by themselves you know kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room
p00929_B,00929,B,tis too much by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy i must go instantly to my mother i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness
p00930_B,00930,B,and this is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end
p00931_B,00931,B,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p00932_B,00932,B,i suspected as much but how did he account for it
p00933_B,00933,B,how could i ever think her like her nephew
p00934_B,00934,B,you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come
p00935_B,00935,B,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged
p00936_B,00936,B,go to your father he wants you in the library
p00937_B,00937,B,have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference
p00938_B,00938,B,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place
p00939_B,00939,B,in a few months my dear marianne elinor will in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but she will be happy
p00940_B,00940,B,infirmity do you call colonel brandon infirm i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs
p00941_B,00941,B,my dearest child at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty
p00942_B,00942,B,perhaps thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel brandon s being thirty five any objection to his marrying her
p00943_B,00943,B,had you any idea of his coming so soon i had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton does elinor expect him already
p00944_B,00944,B,is there a felicity in the world superior to this margaret we will walk here at least two hours
p00945_B,00945,B,and is that all you can say for him but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius
p00946_B,00946,B,but who is he where does he come from has he a house at allenham
p00947_B,00947,B,i do not believe that mr willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible
p00948_B,00948,B,did he indeed and with elegance with spirit
p00949_B,00949,B,well marianne for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask
p00950_B,00950,B,elinor is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have erred against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where i ought to have been reserved spiritless dull and deceitful had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared
p00951_B,00951,B,my love you must not be offended with elinor she was only in jest i should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
p00952_B,00952,B,that is exactly what i think of him
p00953_B,00953,B,do not boast of it however for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him
p00954_B,00954,B,that he is patronised by you is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else
p00955_B,00955,B,that is to say he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome
p00956_B,00956,B,perhaps his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins
p00957_B,00957,B,add to which that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no expression
p00958_B,00958,B,you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart
p00959_B,00959,B,miss dashwood you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever
p00960_B,00960,B,no her opinions are all romantic
p00961_B,00961,B,i must not tell may i elinor
p00962_B,00962,B,oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it what is the gentleman s name
p00963_B,00963,B,margaret you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence
p00964_B,00964,B,i hope he has had no bad news it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly
p00965_B,00965,B,no bad news colonel i hope
p00966_B,00966,B,my dear madam recollect what you are saying
p00967_B,00967,B,no indeed it is not
p00968_B,00968,B,but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon will it not be sufficient
p00969_B,00969,B,we must go it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all
p00970_B,00970,B,i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day
p00971_B,00971,B,if you would but let us know what your business is we might see whether it could be put off or not
p00972_B,00972,B,you would not be six hours later if you were to defer your journey till our return
p00973_B,00973,B,i cannot afford to lose one hour
p00974_B,00974,B,i have no doubt of it
p00975_B,00975,B,you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all
p00976_B,00976,B,oh he must and shall come back if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him
p00977_B,00977,B,ay so do sir john and then perhaps you may find out what his business is
p00978_B,00978,B,no only to honiton i shall then go post
p00979_B,00979,B,i am afraid none at all
p00980_B,00980,B,come colonel before you go do let us know what you are going about
p00981_B,00981,B,i can guess what his business is however yes it is about miss williams i am sure
p00982_B,00982,B,and who is miss williams
p00983_B,00983,B,she is his natural daughter
p00984_B,00984,B,indeed
p00985_B,00985,B,i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning
p00986_B,00986,B,did not you know that we had been out in my curricle
p00987_B,00987,B,yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago
p00988_B,00988,B,why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself
p00989_B,00989,B,yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr willoughby
p00990_B,00990,B,shall we see you tomorrow to dinner i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton
p00991_B,00991,B,is anything the matter with her is she ill
p00992_B,00992,B,i hope not it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment
p00993_B,00993,B,it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here
p00994_B,00994,B,we have never finished hamlet marianne our dear willoughby went away before we could get through it we will put it by that when he comes again but it may be months perhaps before that happens
p00995_B,00995,B,it is he it is indeed i know it is
p00996_B,00996,B,indeed marianne i think you are mistaken it is not willoughby the person is not tall enough for him and has not his air
p00997_B,00997,B,a fortnight
p00998_B,00998,B,have you been lately in sussex
p00999_B,00999,B,i was at norland about a month ago
p01000_B,01000,B,and how does dear dear norland look
p01001_B,01001,B,dear dear norland probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
p01002_B,01002,B,it is a beautiful country but these bottoms must be dirty in winter
p01003_B,01003,B,marianne how can you say so how can you be so unjust they are a very respectable family mr ferrars and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner have you forgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them
p01004_B,01004,B,no i hope my mother is now convinced that i have no more talents than inclination for a public life
p01005_B,01005,B,strange that it would what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness
p01006_B,01006,B,grandeur has but little but wealth has much to do with it
p01007_B,01007,B,hunters but why must you have hunters every body does not hunt
p01008_B,01008,B,i wish that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece
p01009_B,01009,B,we are all unanimous in that wish i suppose in spite of the insufficiency of wealth
p01010_B,01010,B,oh dear how happy i should be i wonder what i should do with it
p01011_B,01011,B,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help
p01012_B,01012,B,you must begin your improvements on this house and your difficulties will soon vanish
p01013_B,01013,B,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes
p01014_B,01014,B,i love to be reminded of the past edward whether it be melancholy or gay i love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times you are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books
p01015_B,01015,B,marianne is as steadfast as ever you see she is not at all altered
p01016_B,01016,B,she is only grown a little more grave than she was
p01017_B,01017,B,nay edward you need not reproach me you are not very gay yourself
p01018_B,01018,B,nor do i think it a part of marianne s i should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
p01019_B,01019,B,but i thought it was right elinor to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people i thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours this has always been your doctrine i am sure
p01020_B,01020,B,you have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility do you gain no ground
p01021_B,01021,B,but you would still be reserved and that is worse
p01022_B,01022,B,do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself
p01023_B,01023,B,you must not enquire too far marianne remember i have no knowledge in the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give i call it a very fine country the hills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there it exactly answers my idea of a fine country because it unites beauty with utility and i dare say it is a picturesque one too because you admire it i can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories grey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me i know nothing of the picturesque
p01024_B,01024,B,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
p01025_B,01025,B,i am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world
p01026_B,01026,B,a dance impossible who is to dance
p01027_B,01027,B,i wish with all my soul that willoughby were among us again
p01028_B,01028,B,and who is willoughby
p01029_B,01029,B,i have been guessing shall i tell you my guess
p01030_B,01030,B,no none at all
p01031_B,01031,B,here comes marianne now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
p01032_B,01032,B,oh dear how beautiful these are well how delightful do but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming i could look at them for ever my love have you been asleep
p01033_B,01033,B,they mean no less to be civil and kind to us now by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago the alteration is not in them if their parties are grown tedious and dull we must look for the change elsewhere
p01034_B,01034,B,oh don t be so sly before us for we know all about it i assure you and i admire your taste very much for i think he is extremely handsome we do not live a great way from him in the country you know not above ten miles i dare say
p01035_B,01035,B,much nearer thirty
p01036_B,01036,B,my dear it is very provoking that we should be so few why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
p01037_B,01037,B,did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done they dined with us last
p01038_B,01038,B,you and i sir john should not stand upon such ceremony
p01039_B,01039,B,then you would be very ill bred
p01040_B,01040,B,my love you contradict every body do you know that you are quite rude
p01041_B,01041,B,ay you may abuse me as you please you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again so there i have the whip hand of you
p01042_B,01042,B,mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour
p01043_B,01043,B,oh my dear miss dashwood i have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas now pray do and come while the westons are with us you cannot think how happy i shall be it will be quite delightful my love don t you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland
p01044_B,01044,B,certainly he seems very agreeable
p01045_B,01045,B,yet i hardly know how unless it had been under totally different circumstances but this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality
p01046_B,01046,B,what a sweet woman lady middleton is
p01047_B,01047,B,and sir john too what a charming man he is and what a charming little family they have i never saw such fine children in my life i declare i quite doat upon them already and indeed i am always distractedly fond of children
p01048_B,01048,B,i should guess so from what i have witnessed this morning
p01049_B,01049,B,i have a notion you think the little middletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see children full of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet
p01050_B,01050,B,and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
p01051_B,01051,B,we have heard sir john admire it excessively
p01052_B,01052,B,i think every one must admire it who ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do
p01053_B,01053,B,and had you a great many smart beaux there i suppose you have not so many in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vast addition always
p01054_B,01054,B,but why should you think that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex
p01055_B,01055,B,upon my word i cannot tell you for i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word but this i can say that if he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him
p01056_B,01056,B,lord anne you can talk of nothing but beaux you will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else
p01057_B,01057,B,how can you say so anne though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well
p01058_B,01058,B,and who was this uncle where did he live how came they acquainted
p01059_B,01059,B,indeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me or i should have been at my filigree already i would not disappoint the little angel for all the world and if you want me at the card table now i am resolved to finish the basket after supper
p01060_B,01060,B,your ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me you know i detest cards i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned
p01061_B,01061,B,marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am and i do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte i ever heard
p01062_B,01062,B,perhaps if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening i should like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it
p01063_B,01063,B,indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help for i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there was and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all
p01064_B,01064,B,oh that would be terrible indeed dear little soul how i do love her
p01065_B,01065,B,you are very kind and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
p01066_B,01066,B,i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on its subject i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again
p01067_B,01067,B,thank you for breaking the ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i told you that monday
p01068_B,01068,B,but what are your views or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth
p01069_B,01069,B,i can answer for it that miss dashwood s is not for he is one of the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly little creature there is no finding out who she likes
p01070_B,01070,B,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s
p01071_B,01071,B,i will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you are a party concerned i dare say you have seen enough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland living which i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while that would be enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest
p01072_B,01072,B,i should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough to her husband
p01073_B,01073,B,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle
p01074_B,01074,B,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed
p01075_B,01075,B,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort
p01076_B,01076,B,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not
p01077_B,01077,B,i am writing home marianne had not you better defer your letter for a day or two
p01078_B,01078,B,i am not going to write to my mother oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is
p01079_B,01079,B,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne
p01080_B,01080,B,at any rate i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week
p01081_B,01081,B,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way
p01082_B,01082,B,don t you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor there seems to me a very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon good god he has been here while we were out
p01083_B,01083,B,you are expecting a letter then
p01084_B,01084,B,did you
p01085_B,01085,B,invited
p01086_B,01086,B,it cannot be generally known for her own family do not know it
p01087_B,01087,B,pray pray be composed and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet
p01088_B,01088,B,how can that be done no my dearest marianne you must wait this is not the place for explanations wait only till tomorrow marianne may i ask
p01089_B,01089,B,and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married
p01090_B,01090,B,the lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich
p01091_B,01091,B,who can this be so early too i thought we had been safe
p01092_B,01092,B,it is colonel brandon we are never safe from him
p01093_B,01093,B,i understand you you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it
p01094_B,01094,B,not in the stage i assure you we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did
p01095_B,01095,B,i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister miss dashwood when they come to town
p01096_B,01096,B,no i do not think we shall
p01097_B,01097,B,long a time indeed why their visit is but just begun
p01098_B,01098,B,i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood i am sorry she is not well
p01099_B,01099,B,you are very good my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation
p01100_B,01100,B,excellent indeed their attention to our comfort their friendliness in every particular is more than i can express
p01101_B,01101,B,they are very pretty ma am an t they do you not think they are something in miss morton s style of painting ma am she does paint most delightfully how beautifully her last landscape is done
p01102_B,01102,B,this is admiration of a very particular kind what is miss morton to us who knows or who cares for her it is elinor of whom we think and speak
p01103_B,01103,B,ah poor dear
p01104_B,01104,B,my dear friend i come to talk to you of my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it
p01105_B,01105,B,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great
p01106_B,01106,B,what can bring her here so often could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing to edward
p01107_B,01107,B,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves
p01108_B,01108,B,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement
p01109_B,01109,B,yes ma am
p01110_B,01110,B,then he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband
p01111_B,01111,B,not at all i believe with you
p01112_B,01112,B,you forget that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of
p01113_B,01113,B,i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
p01114_B,01114,B,thank you ma am it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life
p01115_B,01115,B,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward
p01116_B,01116,B,have you ever seen the lady
p01117_B,01117,B,not yet but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton
p01118_B,01118,B,no sir i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house
p01119_B,01119,B,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established
p01120_B,01120,B,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy
p01121_B,01121,B,i wish to assure you both that i see every thing as you can desire me to do it is a great relief to me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings
p01122_B,01122,B,you consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties
p01123_B,01123,B,rather say your mother s imprudence my child she must be answerable
p01124_B,01124,B,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents
p01125_B,01125,B,who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas
p01126_B,01126,B,when do you write to colonel brandon ma am
p01127_B,01127,B,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day
p01128_B,01128,B,is mrs ferrars at longstaple
p01129_B,01129,B,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style
p01130_B,01130,B,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her
p01131_B,01131,B,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make
p01132_B,01132,B,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first
p01133_B,01133,B,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit
