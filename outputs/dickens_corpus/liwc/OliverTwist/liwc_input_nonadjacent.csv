p00257_A,00257,A,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p00258_A,00258,A,wounded desperate miss
p00259_A,00259,A,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p00260_A,00260,A,not now for the world poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles for my sake
p00261_A,00261,A,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p00262_A,00262,A,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p00263_A,00263,A,nor heard anything about him
p00264_A,00264,A,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p00265_A,00265,A,if it be necessary certainly not
p00266_A,00266,A,then i think it is necessary at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me miss rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour
p00267_A,00267,A,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p00268_A,00268,A,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p00269_A,00269,A,oh no
p00270_A,00270,A,unless there is some other way of preserving the child
p00271_A,00271,A,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p00272_A,00272,A,yes sir i hope so
p00273_A,00273,A,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p00274_A,00274,A,that s what it is sir
p00275_A,00275,A,who s that
p00276_A,00276,A,this is the lady of the house
p00277_A,00277,A,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p00278_A,00278,A,certainly not
p00279_A,00279,A,now what is this about this here boy that the servants are a talking on
p00280_A,00280,A,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p00281_A,00281,A,wery easy disposed of if it is
p00282_A,00282,A,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p00283_A,00283,A,no of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them the more i think of it the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
p00284_A,00284,A,oh what is to be done dear dear why did they send for these people
p00285_A,00285,A,and what the devil s a put up thing
p00286_A,00286,A,nobody suspected them in this case
p00287_A,00287,A,wery pretty indeed it is
p00288_A,00288,A,there was two of em in it and they had a boy with em that s plain from the size of the window that s all to be said at present we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please
p00289_A,00289,A,perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie
p00290_A,00290,A,oh to be sure you shall have it immediately if you will
p00291_A,00291,A,what shall it be
p00292_A,00292,A,a little drop of spirits master if it s all the same it s a cold ride from london ma am and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings
p00293_A,00293,A,you always gave that to him it was the family pet i tell you conkey hadn t any more to do with it than i had
p00294_A,00294,A,what was that
p00295_A,00295,A,if you please sir
p00296_A,00296,A,this this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what d ye call him s grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify you don t mean to deny that i suppose
p00297_A,00297,A,i don t know what to think i don t think it is the boy indeed i m almost certain that it isn t you know it can t be
p00298_A,00298,A,will you if you ever want me i m here i haven t lived here mad and all alone for five and twenty years to be scared by you you shall pay for this you shall pay for this
p00299_A,00299,A,oh i hope so they were so good to me so very very good to me
p00300_A,00300,A,yes sir the old gentleman the housekeeper and a gentleman who was a friend of mr brownlow s all went together
p00301_A,00301,A,my child i never saw you so before
p00302_A,00302,A,i would not alarm you if i could avoid it but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt
p00303_A,00303,A,i think not i will wait until to morrow
p00304_A,00304,A,in fact it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered
p00305_A,00305,A,no as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come
p00306_A,00306,A,here oliver what s the news miss rose master o li ver
p00307_A,00307,A,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p00308_A,00308,A,that i missed them in an instant
p00309_A,00309,A,then they are in the ditch follow and keep as near me as you can
p00310_A,00310,A,who was the other

p00312_A,00312,A,then let it be so it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better
p00313_A,00313,A,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p00314_A,00314,A,i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir
p00315_A,00315,A,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p00316_A,00316,A,we shall see
p00317_A,00317,A,oh quite sir quite
p00318_A,00318,A,and to morrow two months it was done it seems a age

p00237_B,00237,B,i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles
p00238_B,00238,B,i shouldn t wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen mr giles ought to know

p00241_B,00241,B,so am i only there s no call to tell a man he is so bounceably
p00242_B,00242,B,but it s wonderful what a man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i know i should if we d caught one of them rascals i know what it was it was the gate
p00243_B,00243,B,it was about half past two or i wouldn t swear that it mightn t have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes i fancied i heerd a noise heerd a noise i says at first and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct
p00244_B,00244,B,more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater
p00245_B,00245,B,ladies present mr giles
p00246_B,00246,B,so you did
p00247_B,00247,B,was he frightened
p00248_B,00248,B,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p00249_B,00249,B,you re a woman
p00250_B,00250,B,brittles is right from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so it was a knock open the door somebody it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning but the door must be opened do you hear somebody
p00251_B,00251,B,if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses i am ready to make one
p00252_B,00252,B,so am i
p00253_B,00253,B,here he is here s one of the thieves ma am here s a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light
p00254_B,00254,B,in a lantern miss
p00255_B,00255,B,giles
p00256_B,00256,B,i m here miss don t be frightened miss i ain t much injured he didn t make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him
p00257_B,00257,B,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p00258_B,00258,B,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p00259_B,00259,B,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p00260_B,00260,B,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p00261_B,00261,B,it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys
p00262_B,00262,B,he is not in danger i hope
p00263_B,00263,B,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p00264_B,00264,B,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p00265_B,00265,B,now let us hear what you think of him he has not been shaved very recently but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding stop though let me first see that he is in visiting order
p00266_B,00266,B,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p00267_B,00267,B,but at so early an age
p00268_B,00268,B,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p00269_B,00269,B,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p00270_B,00270,B,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p00271_B,00271,B,sit still
p00272_B,00272,B,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p00273_B,00273,B,that s what it is sir
p00274_B,00274,B,it s the runners
p00275_B,00275,B,oh good evening master can i have a word or two with you in private if you please
p00276_B,00276,B,certainly not
p00277_B,00277,B,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p00278_B,00278,B,that s it master this is all about the robbery is it
p00279_B,00279,B,wery easy disposed of if it is
p00280_B,00280,B,what he says is quite correct who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didn t drop out of the clouds did he master
p00281_B,00281,B,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p00282_B,00282,B,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p00283_B,00283,B,why indeed i would not have had them here for the world
p00284_B,00284,B,all i know is that we must try and carry it off with a bold face the object is a good one and that must be our excuse the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more that s one comfort we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours come in
p00285_B,00285,B,nobody suspected them in this case
p00286_B,00286,B,more likely on that wery account
p00287_B,00287,B,perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie
p00288_B,00288,B,oh to be sure you shall have it immediately if you will
p00289_B,00289,B,why thank you miss it s dry work this sort of duty anythink that s handy miss don t put yourself out of the way on our accounts

p00314_B,00314,B,the great nobs under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them

p00356_B,00356,B,he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over
