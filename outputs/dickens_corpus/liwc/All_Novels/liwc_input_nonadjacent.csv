p00002_A,00002,A,yes sir no sir
p00003_A,00003,A,i ll explain to you then why you wouldn t paper a room with representations of horses do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality in fact do you of course no why then you are not to see anywhere what you don t see in fact you are not to have anywhere what you don t have in fact what is called taste is only another name for fact this is a new principle a discovery a great discovery now i ll try you again suppose you were going to carpet a room would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it girl number twenty so you would carpet your room or your husband s room if you were a grown woman and had a husband with representations of flowers would you why would you
p00004_A,00004,A,it wouldn t hurt them sir they wouldn t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy
p00005_A,00005,A,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure

p00114_A,00114,A,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00115_A,00115,A,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00116_A,00116,A,i suppose it might
p00117_A,00117,A,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit
p00118_A,00118,A,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00119_A,00119,A,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00120_A,00120,A,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00121_A,00121,A,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00122_A,00122,A,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00123_A,00123,A,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00124_A,00124,A,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00125_A,00125,A,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00126_A,00126,A,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00127_A,00127,A,the more s the pity sir you are losing all your good old habits cheer up sir if miss gradgrind will permit me i will offer to make it for you as i have often done
p00128_A,00128,A,your health ma am
p00129_A,00129,A,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00130_A,00130,A,if i waited to be taken care of by my wife ma am i believe you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday so i ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot
p00131_A,00131,A,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00132_A,00132,A,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00133_A,00133,A,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00134_A,00134,A,what do you mean ma am
p00135_A,00135,A,for you louisa
p00136_A,00136,A,oh no louisa it was done before i came it was
p00137_A,00137,A,o my child my child i am an unhappy man to see you thus what avails it to me that you do not reproach me if i so bitterly reproach myself louisa i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house by mere love and gratitude that what the head had left undone and could not do the heart may have been doing silently can it be so i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear
p00138_A,00138,A,outside this door sir
p00139_A,00139,A,if i do not understand and i do not sir what your honour as a gentleman binds you to in other matters i am sure i may rely upon it to keep my visit secret and to keep secret what i am going to say i will rely upon it if you will tell me i may so far trust
p00140_A,00140,A,you may i assure you
p00141_A,00141,A,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p00142_A,00142,A,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p00143_A,00143,A,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p00144_A,00144,A,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00145_A,00145,A,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed
p00146_A,00146,A,mrs bounderby i don t disturb you i hope this is an unseasonable hour but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary tom gradgrind as your son young tom refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements good or bad i am obliged to confront her with your daughter
p00147_A,00147,A,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p00148_A,00148,A,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p00149_A,00149,A,why couldn t you say so young tom
p00150_A,00150,A,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p00151_A,00151,A,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p00152_A,00152,A,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p00153_A,00153,A,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p00154_A,00154,A,did you offer him a bank note
p00155_A,00155,A,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p00156_A,00156,A,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p00157_A,00157,A,i am very very sorry
p00158_A,00158,A,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p00159_A,00159,A,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p00160_A,00160,A,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p00161_A,00161,A,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p00162_A,00162,A,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p00163_A,00163,A,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p00164_A,00164,A,good night father
p00165_A,00165,A,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p00166_A,00166,A,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p00167_A,00167,A,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p00168_A,00168,A,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p00169_A,00169,A,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p00170_A,00170,A,then i will come next night too
p00171_A,00171,A,it s a coincidence it s a providence come out ma am come out or we ll have you dragged out leave her alone everybody let nobody touch her she belongs to me come in ma am come in ma am or we ll have you dragged in
p00172_A,00172,A,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her

p00174_A,00174,A,josiah in the gutter no such a thing sir never for shame on you my dear boy knows and will give you to know that though he come of humble parents he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful and i ve his books at home to show it aye have i and my dear boy knows and will give you to know sir that after his beloved father died when he was eight years old his mother too could pinch a bit as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it to help him out in life and put him prentice and a steady lad he was and a kind master he had to lend him a hand and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving and i ll give you to know sir for this my dear boy won t that though his mother kept but a little village shop he never forgot her but pensioned me on thirty pound a year more than i want for i put by out of it only making the condition that i was to keep down in my own part and make no boasts about him and not trouble him and i never have except with looking at him once a year when he has never knowed it and it s right that i should keep down in my own part and i have no doubts that if i was here i should do a many unbefitting things and i am well contented and i can keep my pride in my josiah to myself and i can love for love s own sake and i am ashamed of you sir for your slanders and suspicions and i never stood here before nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no and i shouldn t be here now if it hadn t been for being brought here and for shame upon you oh for shame to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son with my son standing here to tell you so different
p00175_A,00175,A,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening

p00433_A,00433,A,speak for yourself sir
p00434_A,00434,A,so i do it s natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am
p00435_A,00435,A,i shouldn t wonder if it was
p00436_A,00436,A,what sort of a noise
p00437_A,00437,A,lor

p00442_A,00442,A,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p00443_A,00443,A,you re a woman
p00444_A,00444,A,brittles is right from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so it was a knock open the door somebody it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning but the door must be opened do you hear somebody
p00445_A,00445,A,so am i
p00446_A,00446,A,a boy what s the matter with the eh why brittles look here don t you know
p00447_A,00447,A,here he is here s one of the thieves ma am here s a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light
p00448_A,00448,A,in a lantern miss
p00449_A,00449,A,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p00450_A,00450,A,wounded desperate miss
p00451_A,00451,A,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p00452_A,00452,A,not now for the world poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles for my sake
p00453_A,00453,A,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p00454_A,00454,A,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p00455_A,00455,A,nor heard anything about him
p00456_A,00456,A,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p00457_A,00457,A,if it be necessary certainly not
p00458_A,00458,A,then i think it is necessary at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me miss rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour
p00459_A,00459,A,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p00460_A,00460,A,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p00461_A,00461,A,oh no
p00462_A,00462,A,unless there is some other way of preserving the child
p00463_A,00463,A,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p00464_A,00464,A,yes sir i hope so
p00465_A,00465,A,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p00466_A,00466,A,that s what it is sir
p00467_A,00467,A,who s that
p00468_A,00468,A,this is the lady of the house
p00469_A,00469,A,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p00470_A,00470,A,certainly not
p00471_A,00471,A,now what is this about this here boy that the servants are a talking on
p00472_A,00472,A,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p00473_A,00473,A,wery easy disposed of if it is
p00474_A,00474,A,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p00475_A,00475,A,no of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them the more i think of it the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
p00476_A,00476,A,oh what is to be done dear dear why did they send for these people
p00477_A,00477,A,and what the devil s a put up thing
p00478_A,00478,A,nobody suspected them in this case
p00479_A,00479,A,wery pretty indeed it is
p00480_A,00480,A,there was two of em in it and they had a boy with em that s plain from the size of the window that s all to be said at present we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please
p00481_A,00481,A,perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie
p00482_A,00482,A,oh to be sure you shall have it immediately if you will
p00483_A,00483,A,what shall it be
p00484_A,00484,A,a little drop of spirits master if it s all the same it s a cold ride from london ma am and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings
p00485_A,00485,A,you always gave that to him it was the family pet i tell you conkey hadn t any more to do with it than i had
p00486_A,00486,A,what was that
p00487_A,00487,A,if you please sir
p00488_A,00488,A,this this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what d ye call him s grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify you don t mean to deny that i suppose
p00489_A,00489,A,i don t know what to think i don t think it is the boy indeed i m almost certain that it isn t you know it can t be
p00490_A,00490,A,will you if you ever want me i m here i haven t lived here mad and all alone for five and twenty years to be scared by you you shall pay for this you shall pay for this
p00491_A,00491,A,oh i hope so they were so good to me so very very good to me
p00492_A,00492,A,yes sir the old gentleman the housekeeper and a gentleman who was a friend of mr brownlow s all went together
p00493_A,00493,A,my child i never saw you so before
p00494_A,00494,A,i would not alarm you if i could avoid it but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt
p00495_A,00495,A,i think not i will wait until to morrow
p00496_A,00496,A,in fact it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered
p00497_A,00497,A,no as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come
p00498_A,00498,A,here oliver what s the news miss rose master o li ver
p00499_A,00499,A,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p00500_A,00500,A,that i missed them in an instant
p00501_A,00501,A,then they are in the ditch follow and keep as near me as you can
p00502_A,00502,A,who was the other
p00503_A,00503,A,as i am that the men were at the window the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
p00504_A,00504,A,then let it be so it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better
p00505_A,00505,A,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p00506_A,00506,A,i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir
p00507_A,00507,A,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p00508_A,00508,A,we shall see
p00509_A,00509,A,oh quite sir quite
p00510_A,00510,A,and to morrow two months it was done it seems a age
p00511_A,00511,A,well

p00515_A,00515,A,is that the man then mind what i told you and be careful to say as little as you can or you ll betray us at once
p00516_A,00516,A,cooling yourselves not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hell s fire out as a man can carry about with him you won t cool yourself so easily don t think it this is the woman is it

p00520_A,00520,A,all i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at and i want to know nothing for it s safer not but i may ask you two questions may i
p00521_A,00521,A,you may ask but whether i answer or not is another question
p00522_A,00522,A,which makes three
p00523_A,00523,A,what do you propose to do with it can it be used against me
p00524_A,00524,A,what s the matter here my dear

p00109_B,00109,B,i say i think i can do you a good turn don t ask me what it is because it may not come to anything but there s no harm in my trying that was our light porter at the bank who brought you the message to night i call him our light porter because i belong to the bank too

p00113_B,00113,B,i never in my life saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those features
p00114_B,00114,B,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00115_B,00115,B,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00116_B,00116,B,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit
p00117_B,00117,B,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00118_B,00118,B,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00119_B,00119,B,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00120_B,00120,B,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00121_B,00121,B,where is tom by the by
p00122_B,00122,B,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00123_B,00123,B,suspicious certainly
p00124_B,00124,B,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00125_B,00125,B,but it is my duty to remember that what i was i am no longer indeed if i could altogether cancel the remembrance that mr sparsit was a powler or that i myself am related to the scadgers family or if i could even revoke the fact and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions i would gladly do so i should think it under existing circumstances right to do so
p00126_B,00126,B,indeed you are very good sir wait for the simple mutton
p00127_B,00127,B,your health ma am
p00128_B,00128,B,tom have you anything to tell me if ever you loved me in your life and have anything concealed from every one besides tell it to me
p00129_B,00129,B,there stop where you are ma am stop where you are mrs bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble i believe
p00130_B,00130,B,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00131_B,00131,B,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00132_B,00132,B,my benefactor
p00133_B,00133,B,serve you right you noodle and i am glad of it
p00134_B,00134,B,bitzer present my compliments to young mr thomas and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup with a glass of india ale mr thomas these plain viands being on table i thought you might be tempted
p00135_B,00135,B,when was i brought to this room
p00136_B,00136,B,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00137_B,00137,B,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00138_B,00138,B,to mr harthouse and you speak to him with the most confiding eyes i ever saw and the most earnest voice though so quiet i ever heard
p00139_B,00139,B,i am young as you see i am alone as you see in coming to you sir i have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope but that is very strong this is a very odd beginning i don t see where we are going
p00140_B,00140,B,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now
p00141_B,00141,B,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence
p00142_B,00142,B,send my fellow here
p00143_B,00143,B,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00144_B,00144,B,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone
p00145_B,00145,B,my dear bounderby
p00146_B,00146,B,i have
p00147_B,00147,B,why couldn t you say so young tom
p00148_B,00148,B,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p00149_B,00149,B,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p00150_B,00150,B,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p00151_B,00151,B,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p00152_B,00152,B,did you offer him a bank note
p00153_B,00153,B,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p00154_B,00154,B,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p00155_B,00155,B,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p00156_B,00156,B,i am very very sorry
p00157_B,00157,B,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p00158_B,00158,B,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p00159_B,00159,B,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p00160_B,00160,B,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p00161_B,00161,B,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p00162_B,00162,B,good night father
p00163_B,00163,B,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p00164_B,00164,B,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p00165_B,00165,B,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p00166_B,00166,B,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p00167_B,00167,B,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p00168_B,00168,B,then i will come next night too
p00169_B,00169,B,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p00170_B,00170,B,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p00171_B,00171,B,it s mrs pegler
p00172_B,00172,B,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p00173_B,00173,B,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p00174_B,00174,B,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael

p00181_B,00181,B,we had our fears before yesterday and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last night and heard what passed being close to rachael all the time i went to him when no one saw and said to him he was in a tremble before i whispered to him and he started and trembled more then and said i thought of father s old circus i have not forgotten where mr sleary goes at this time of year and i read of him in a paper only the other day i told him to hurry there and tell his name and ask mr sleary to hide him till i came he said and i saw him shrink away among the people

p00437_B,00437,B,ladies present mr giles
p00438_B,00438,B,so you did
p00439_B,00439,B,was he frightened
p00440_B,00440,B,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p00441_B,00441,B,you re a woman
p00442_B,00442,B,brittles is right from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so it was a knock open the door somebody it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning but the door must be opened do you hear somebody
p00443_B,00443,B,if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses i am ready to make one
p00444_B,00444,B,so am i
p00445_B,00445,B,here he is here s one of the thieves ma am here s a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light
p00446_B,00446,B,in a lantern miss
p00447_B,00447,B,giles
p00448_B,00448,B,i m here miss don t be frightened miss i ain t much injured he didn t make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him
p00449_B,00449,B,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p00450_B,00450,B,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p00451_B,00451,B,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p00452_B,00452,B,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p00453_B,00453,B,it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys
p00454_B,00454,B,he is not in danger i hope
p00455_B,00455,B,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p00456_B,00456,B,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p00457_B,00457,B,now let us hear what you think of him he has not been shaved very recently but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding stop though let me first see that he is in visiting order
p00458_B,00458,B,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p00459_B,00459,B,but at so early an age
p00460_B,00460,B,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p00461_B,00461,B,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p00462_B,00462,B,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p00463_B,00463,B,sit still
p00464_B,00464,B,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p00465_B,00465,B,that s what it is sir

p00467_B,00467,B,oh good evening master can i have a word or two with you in private if you please
p00468_B,00468,B,certainly not
p00469_B,00469,B,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p00470_B,00470,B,that s it master this is all about the robbery is it
p00471_B,00471,B,wery easy disposed of if it is
p00472_B,00472,B,what he says is quite correct who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didn t drop out of the clouds did he master
p00473_B,00473,B,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p00474_B,00474,B,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p00475_B,00475,B,why indeed i would not have had them here for the world
p00476_B,00476,B,all i know is that we must try and carry it off with a bold face the object is a good one and that must be our excuse the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more that s one comfort we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours come in
p00477_B,00477,B,nobody suspected them in this case
p00478_B,00478,B,more likely on that wery account

p00596_B,00596,B,especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him that s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return
