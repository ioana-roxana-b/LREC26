p00000_A,00000,A,it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them
p00001_A,00001,A,depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all
p00002_A,00002,A,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
p00003_A,00003,A,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p00004_A,00004,A,don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces
p00005_A,00005,A,kitty has no discretion in her coughs she times them ill
p00006_A,00006,A,i do not cough for my own amusement
p00007_A,00007,A,to morrow fortnight
p00008_A,00008,A,now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse
p00009_A,00009,A,my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable
p00010_A,00010,A,aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to
p00011_A,00011,A,miss bingley told me
p00012_A,00012,A,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable
p00013_A,00013,A,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p00014_A,00014,A,another time lizzy i would not dance with him if i were you
p00015_A,00015,A,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p00016_A,00016,A,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine
p00017_A,00017,A,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p00018_A,00018,A,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p00019_A,00019,A,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p00020_A,00020,A,that is a question which mr darcy only can answer
p00021_A,00021,A,with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic
p00022_A,00022,A,you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers very well if it must be so it must there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song
p00023_A,00023,A,it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it
p00024_A,00024,A,he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner
p00025_A,00025,A,this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish
p00026_A,00026,A,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p00027_A,00027,A,well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love
p00028_A,00028,A,it is from miss bingley
p00029_A,00029,A,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p00030_A,00030,A,can i have the carriage
p00031_A,00031,A,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p00032_A,00032,A,i had much rather go in the coach
p00033_A,00033,A,but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they
p00034_A,00034,A,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p00035_A,00035,A,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p00036_A,00036,A,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders
p00037_A,00037,A,oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage how can you be so silly as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there
p00038_A,00038,A,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p00039_A,00039,A,no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner
p00040_A,00040,A,she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy
p00041_A,00041,A,yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office
p00042_A,00042,A,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p00043_A,00043,A,certainly not
p00044_A,00044,A,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p00045_A,00045,A,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p00046_A,00046,A,yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside
p00047_A,00047,A,that is capital
p00048_A,00048,A,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p00049_A,00049,A,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p00050_A,00050,A,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p00051_A,00051,A,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p00052_A,00052,A,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p00053_A,00053,A,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p00054_A,00054,A,i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
p00055_A,00055,A,upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation
p00056_A,00056,A,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p00057_A,00057,A,all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean
p00058_A,00058,A,yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished
p00059_A,00059,A,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p00060_A,00060,A,nor i i am sure
p00061_A,00061,A,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p00062_A,00062,A,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p00063_A,00063,A,are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this
p00064_A,00064,A,i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united
p00065_A,00065,A,undoubtedly there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
p00066_A,00066,A,indeed i have sir she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness
p00067_A,00067,A,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p00068_A,00068,A,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p00069_A,00069,A,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p00070_A,00070,A,i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful
p00071_A,00071,A,that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours
p00072_A,00072,A,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p00073_A,00073,A,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p00074_A,00074,A,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p00075_A,00075,A,indeed mama you are mistaken you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true
p00076_A,00076,A,she seems a very pleasant young woman
p00077_A,00077,A,oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were
p00078_A,00078,A,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p00079_A,00079,A,of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away
p00080_A,00080,A,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p00081_A,00081,A,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p00082_A,00082,A,they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine
p00083_A,00083,A,it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill
p00084_A,00084,A,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p00085_A,00085,A,my style of writing is very different from yours
p00086_A,00086,A,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p00087_A,00087,A,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p00088_A,00088,A,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p00089_A,00089,A,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies
p00090_A,00090,A,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month
p00091_A,00091,A,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it
p00092_A,00092,A,upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself
p00093_A,00093,A,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it
p00094_A,00094,A,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this
p00095_A,00095,A,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me
p00096_A,00096,A,i did not know that you intended to walk
p00097_A,00097,A,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out
p00098_A,00098,A,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye
p00099_A,00099,A,very glad
p00100_A,00100,A,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball
p00101_A,00101,A,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude
p00102_A,00102,A,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
p00103_A,00103,A,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
p00104_A,00104,A,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself
p00105_A,00105,A,such as vanity and pride
p00106_A,00106,A,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation
p00107_A,00107,A,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p00108_A,00108,A,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body
p00109_A,00109,A,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again
p00110_A,00110,A,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him
p00111_A,00111,A,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p00112_A,00112,A,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p00113_A,00113,A,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p00114_A,00114,A,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court
p00115_A,00115,A,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p00116_A,00116,A,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p00117_A,00117,A,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life
p00118_A,00118,A,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure
p00119_A,00119,A,i know very well madam that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters
p00120_A,00120,A,i believe her to be both in a great degree i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class
p00121_A,00121,A,i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here
p00122_A,00122,A,i dare say you will find him very agreeable
p00123_A,00123,A,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life
p00124_A,00124,A,i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me
p00125_A,00125,A,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours
p00126_A,00126,A,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant
p00127_A,00127,A,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy
p00128_A,00128,A,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
p00129_A,00129,A,lord how tired i am
p00130_A,00130,A,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning
p00131_A,00131,A,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p00132_A,00132,A,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins
p00133_A,00133,A,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity
p00134_A,00134,A,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him
p00135_A,00135,A,i have sir
p00136_A,00136,A,my dear i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be
p00137_A,00137,A,now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together
p00138_A,00138,A,i found as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself
p00139_A,00139,A,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence
p00140_A,00140,A,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood
p00141_A,00141,A,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves
p00142_A,00142,A,i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford my father and maria are to come to me in march and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them
p00143_A,00143,A,lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed and a most attentive neighbour
p00144_A,00144,A,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference
p00145_A,00145,A,do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved
p00146_A,00146,A,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age
p00147_A,00147,A,my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there
p00148_A,00148,A,we are speaking of music madam
p00149_A,00149,A,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p00150_A,00150,A,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house
p00151_A,00151,A,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear
p00152_A,00152,A,i am not afraid of you
p00153_A,00153,A,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p00154_A,00154,A,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers
p00155_A,00155,A,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers
p00156_A,00156,A,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p00157_A,00157,A,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers
p00158_A,00158,A,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn
p00159_A,00159,A,you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn are you pleased with kent
p00160_A,00160,A,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money
p00161_A,00161,A,my uncle is to send a servant for us
p00162_A,00162,A,oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to
p00163_A,00163,A,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
p00164_A,00164,A,and mary king is safe safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune
p00165_A,00165,A,i am glad you are come back lizzy
p00166_A,00166,A,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book
p00167_A,00167,A,it was a subject which they could not mention before me
p00168_A,00168,A,if one could but go to brighton
p00169_A,00169,A,oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable
p00170_A,00170,A,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
p00171_A,00171,A,do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life
p00172_A,00172,A,i have heard much of your master s fine person it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not
p00173_A,00173,A,yes very handsome
p00174_A,00174,A,is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year
p00175_A,00175,A,not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months
p00176_A,00176,A,if your master would marry you might see more of him
p00177_A,00177,A,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p00178_A,00178,A,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p00179_A,00179,A,yes sir i know i am if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world
p00180_A,00180,A,his father was an excellent man
p00181_A,00181,A,yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor he is the best landlord and the best master that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men
p00182_A,00182,A,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her
p00183_A,00183,A,for your housekeeper informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country
p00184_A,00184,A,they will join me early to morrow and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters there is also one other person in the party who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton
p00185_A,00185,A,pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family
p00186_A,00186,A,yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled
p00187_A,00187,A,that is all settled
p00188_A,00188,A,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk
p00189_A,00189,A,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p00190_A,00190,A,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage
p00191_A,00191,A,oh my dear brother that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all
p00192_A,00192,A,she had better have stayed at home perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied
p00193_A,00193,A,do you suppose them to be in london
p00194_A,00194,A,and lydia used to want to go to london
p00195_A,00195,A,she is happy then and her residence there will probably be of some duration lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind
p00196_A,00196,A,you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner well well do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them
p00197_A,00197,A,dear madam don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter
p00198_A,00198,A,well and what news does it bring good or bad
p00199_A,00199,A,what is there of good to be expected but perhaps you would like to read it read it aloud for i hardly know myself what it is about
p00200_A,00200,A,wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him my dear father i congratulate you
p00201_A,00201,A,no but it must be done soon
p00202_A,00202,A,oh my dear father come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case
p00203_A,00203,A,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p00204_A,00204,A,and they must marry yet he is such a man
p00205_A,00205,A,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p00206_A,00206,A,no wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
p00207_A,00207,A,ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid
p00208_A,00208,A,take whatever you like and get away
p00209_A,00209,A,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p00210_A,00210,A,i should like it beyond any thing
p00211_A,00211,A,mr darcy
p00212_A,00212,A,oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret
p00213_A,00213,A,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p00214_A,00214,A,write to me very often my dear
p00215_A,00215,A,as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do
p00216_A,00216,A,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p00217_A,00217,A,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p00218_A,00218,A,well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
p00219_A,00219,A,you may depend on it for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed
p00220_A,00220,A,la it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr what s his name that tall proud man
p00221_A,00221,A,you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement
p00222_A,00222,A,my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
p00223_A,00223,A,well girls what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously
p00224_A,00224,A,what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do
p00225_A,00225,A,nothing child nothing i did not wink at you come here my love i want to speak to you lizzy my dear i want to speak with you
p00226_A,00226,A,we may as well leave them by themselves you know kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room
p00227_A,00227,A,jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman you are a good girl and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income
p00228_A,00228,A,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p00229_A,00229,A,yes very well i saw them the night before last miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company
p00230_A,00230,A,go my dear and shew her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage
p00231_A,00231,A,it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now
p00232_A,00232,A,it may do very well for the others but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty
p00233_A,00233,A,go to your father he wants you in the library
p00234_A,00234,A,good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted my dearest child i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow
p00000_B,00000,B,i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy
p00001_B,00001,B,we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes since we are not to visit
p00002_B,00002,B,but you forget mama that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him
p00003_B,00003,B,no more have i and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you
p00004_B,00004,B,i do not cough for my own amusement
p00005_B,00005,B,to morrow fortnight
p00006_B,00006,B,aye so it is and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself
p00007_B,00007,B,then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her
p00008_B,00008,B,oh i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest
p00009_B,00009,B,are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her
p00010_B,00010,B,that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable
p00011_B,00011,B,i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise
p00012_B,00012,B,i do not mind his not talking to mrs long but i wish he had danced with eliza
p00013_B,00013,B,i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him
p00014_B,00014,B,his pride does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud
p00015_B,00015,B,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
p00016_B,00016,B,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day
p00017_B,00017,B,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly
p00018_B,00018,B,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on
p00019_B,00019,B,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too
p00020_B,00020,B,did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton
p00021_B,00021,B,it will be her turn soon to be teazed i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows
p00022_B,00022,B,certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance
p00023_B,00023,B,my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you
p00024_B,00024,B,i should imagine not
p00025_B,00025,B,mama my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library
p00026_B,00026,B,it is from miss bingley
p00027_B,00027,B,with the officers i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that
p00028_B,00028,B,dining out that is very unlucky
p00029_B,00029,B,can i have the carriage
p00030_B,00030,B,that would be a good scheme if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home
p00031_B,00031,B,i had much rather go in the coach
p00032_B,00032,B,they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them
p00033_B,00033,B,but if you have got them to day my mother s purpose will be answered
p00034_B,00034,B,this was a lucky idea of mine indeed
p00035_B,00035,B,well my dear if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders
p00036_B,00036,B,i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want
p00037_B,00037,B,is this a hint to me lizzy to send for the horses
p00038_B,00038,B,i admire the activity of your benevolence but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required
p00039_B,00039,B,if we make haste perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes
p00040_B,00040,B,your picture may be very exact louisa but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice
p00041_B,00041,B,you observed it mr darcy i am sure and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition
p00042_B,00042,B,certainly not
p00043_B,00043,B,it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing
p00044_B,00044,B,not at all they were brightened by the exercise
p00045_B,00045,B,i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton
p00046_B,00046,B,if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
p00047_B,00047,B,but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world
p00048_B,00048,B,do you prefer reading to cards that is rather singular
p00049_B,00049,B,miss eliza bennet despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else
p00050_B,00050,B,i deserve neither such praise nor such censure i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things
p00051_B,00051,B,in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into
p00052_B,00052,B,i am astonished that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy
p00053_B,00053,B,it ought to be good it has been the work of many generations
p00054_B,00054,B,i wish it may
p00055_B,00055,B,i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller
p00056_B,00056,B,it is amazing to me how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are
p00057_B,00057,B,your list of the common extent of accomplishments has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished
p00058_B,00058,B,nor i i am sure
p00059_B,00059,B,then you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman
p00060_B,00060,B,yes i do comprehend a great deal in it
p00061_B,00061,B,oh certainly no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved
p00062_B,00062,B,i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any
p00063_B,00063,B,eliza bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art
p00064_B,00064,B,undoubtedly there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable
p00065_B,00065,B,removed it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal
p00066_B,00066,B,you may depend upon it madam that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us
p00067_B,00067,B,i am sure if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease
p00068_B,00068,B,whatever i do is done in a hurry and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here
p00069_B,00069,B,that is exactly what i should have supposed of you
p00070_B,00070,B,lizzy remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home
p00071_B,00071,B,i did not know before that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study
p00072_B,00072,B,yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage
p00073_B,00073,B,the country can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society
p00074_B,00074,B,yes indeed i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley aye that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all
p00075_B,00075,B,did charlotte dine with you
p00076_B,00076,B,and so ended his affection there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love
p00077_B,00077,B,i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love
p00078_B,00078,B,i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill
p00079_B,00079,B,oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not
p00080_B,00080,B,how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter you write uncommonly fast
p00081_B,00081,B,you are mistaken i write rather slowly
p00082_B,00082,B,that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy
p00083_B,00083,B,my style of writing is very different from yours
p00084_B,00084,B,oh charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest
p00085_B,00085,B,my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents
p00086_B,00086,B,your humility mr bingley must disarm reproof
p00087_B,00087,B,nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast
p00088_B,00088,B,and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty
p00089_B,00089,B,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself
p00090_B,00090,B,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could
p00091_B,00091,B,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety
p00092_B,00092,B,to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you
p00093_B,00093,B,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do
p00094_B,00094,B,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter
p00095_B,00095,B,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel
p00096_B,00096,B,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue
p00097_B,00097,B,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye
p00098_B,00098,B,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure
p00099_B,00099,B,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards
p00100_B,00100,B,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
p00101_B,00101,B,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire
p00102_B,00102,B,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech
p00103_B,00103,B,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done
p00104_B,00104,B,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke
p00105_B,00105,B,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result
p00106_B,00106,B,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise
p00107_B,00107,B,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever
p00108_B,00108,B,do let us have a little music louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst
p00109_B,00109,B,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit
p00110_B,00110,B,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir
p00111_B,00111,B,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him
p00112_B,00112,B,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed
p00113_B,00113,B,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly
p00114_B,00114,B,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study
p00115_B,00115,B,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town
p00116_B,00116,B,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged
p00117_B,00117,B,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy
p00118_B,00118,B,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long
p00119_B,00119,B,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy
p00120_B,00120,B,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody
p00121_B,00121,B,heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil
p00122_B,00122,B,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent
p00123_B,00123,B,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of
p00124_B,00124,B,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine
p00125_B,00125,B,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself
p00126_B,00126,B,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon
p00127_B,00127,B,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him
p00128_B,00128,B,for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing
p00129_B,00129,B,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs
p00130_B,00130,B,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself
p00131_B,00131,B,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married
p00132_B,00132,B,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them
p00133_B,00133,B,oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her
p00134_B,00134,B,come here child i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true very well and this offer of marriage you have refused
p00135_B,00135,B,yes or i will never see her again
p00136_B,00136,B,pray do my dear miss lucas for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves
p00137_B,00137,B,my dear madam let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise
p00138_B,00138,B,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them
p00139_B,00139,B,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible
p00140_B,00140,B,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune
p00141_B,00141,B,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before
p00142_B,00142,B,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary
p00143_B,00143,B,oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment
p00144_B,00144,B,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter
p00145_B,00145,B,a little
p00146_B,00146,B,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me
p00147_B,00147,B,we are speaking of music madam
p00148_B,00148,B,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly
p00149_B,00149,B,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me
p00150_B,00150,B,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own
p00151_B,00151,B,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers
p00152_B,00152,B,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact
p00153_B,00153,B,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party
p00154_B,00154,B,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble
p00155_B,00155,B,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done
p00156_B,00156,B,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution
p00157_B,00157,B,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london
p00158_B,00158,B,perfectly so i thank you
p00159_B,00159,B,i did not know before that you ever walked this way
p00160_B,00160,B,and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her
p00161_B,00161,B,i know not miss elizabeth whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other
p00162_B,00162,B,but you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here
p00163_B,00163,B,a great many indeed
p00164_B,00164,B,but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side
p00165_B,00165,B,far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book
p00166_B,00166,B,indeed i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him
p00167_B,00167,B,i am sure i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart
p00168_B,00168,B,and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good
p00169_B,00169,B,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older
p00170_B,00170,B,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair
p00171_B,00171,B,nearly three weeks
p00172_B,00172,B,a little
p00173_B,00173,B,and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother
p00174_B,00174,B,except when she goes to ramsgate
p00175_B,00175,B,if your master would marry you might see more of him
p00176_B,00176,B,it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so
p00177_B,00177,B,there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master
p00178_B,00178,B,can this be mr darcy
p00179_B,00179,B,his father was an excellent man
p00180_B,00180,B,in what an amiable light does this place him
p00181_B,00181,B,this fine account of him is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
p00182_B,00182,B,what will be his surprise when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me
p00183_B,00183,B,he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming
p00184_B,00184,B,there is something a little stately in him to be sure but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it
p00185_B,00185,B,yes but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance
p00186_B,00186,B,and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was
p00187_B,00187,B,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk
p00188_B,00188,B,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it
p00189_B,00189,B,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland
p00190_B,00190,B,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt
p00191_B,00191,B,but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard give me farther particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever
p00192_B,00192,B,a gamester this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it
p00193_B,00193,B,and lydia used to want to go to london
p00194_B,00194,B,this is a parade which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away
p00195_B,00195,B,i am not going to run away papa if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia
p00196_B,00196,B,what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town
p00197_B,00197,B,oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle
p00198_B,00198,B,then it is as i always hoped they are married
p00199_B,00199,B,is it possible can it be possible that he will marry her
p00200_B,00200,B,no but it must be done soon
p00201_B,00201,B,let me write for you if you dislike the trouble yourself
p00202_B,00202,B,i dislike it very much but it must be done
p00203_B,00203,B,and may i ask but the terms i suppose must be complied with
p00204_B,00204,B,money my uncle what do you mean sir
p00205_B,00205,B,that is very true though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this
p00206_B,00206,B,and they are really to be married how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia
p00207_B,00207,B,i comfort myself with thinking that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds
p00208_B,00208,B,for we must attribute this happy conclusion in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money
p00209_B,00209,B,i will go to meryton as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding
p00210_B,00210,B,i thank you for my share of the favour but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands
p00211_B,00211,B,if it was to be secret say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further
p00212_B,00212,B,oh certainly we will ask you no questions
p00213_B,00213,B,thank you for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry
p00214_B,00214,B,he is as fine a fellow as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law
p00215_B,00215,B,i often think that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them
p00216_B,00216,B,this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
p00217_B,00217,B,well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming
p00218_B,00218,B,i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but don t imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks
p00219_B,00219,B,yet it is hard that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself
p00220_B,00220,B,let me first see how he behaves it will then be early enough for expectation could i expect it to be otherwise yet why did he come
p00221_B,00221,B,now that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance
p00222_B,00222,B,if he does not come to me then i shall give him up for ever a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings
p00223_B,00223,B,you are very cruel you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment
p00224_B,00224,B,we may as well leave them by themselves you know kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room
p00225_B,00225,B,tis too much by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy i must go instantly to my mother i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness
p00226_B,00226,B,and this is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest most reasonable end
p00227_B,00227,B,exceed their income my dear mr bennet what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen
p00228_B,00228,B,i suspected as much but how did he account for it
p00229_B,00229,B,how could i ever think her like her nephew
p00230_B,00230,B,you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come
p00231_B,00231,B,this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged
p00232_B,00232,B,go to your father he wants you in the library
p00233_B,00233,B,have you any other objection than your belief of my indifference
p00234_B,00234,B,how could you begin i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place
