p00000_A,00000,A,i beg catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and i wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend i will give you this little book on purpose
p00001_A,00001,A,i don t upon my word i wish i did i wish i had a large acquaintance here with all my heart and then i should get you a partner i should be so glad to have you dance there goes a strange looking woman what an odd gown she has got on how old fashioned it is look at the back

p00006_A,00006,A,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray
p00007_A,00007,A,how can you be so
p00008_A,00008,A,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes
p00009_A,00009,A,how excessively like her brother miss morland is
p00010_A,00010,A,the very picture of him indeed i should have known her anywhere for his sister
p00011_A,00011,A,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p00012_A,00012,A,i do not know the distance
p00013_A,00013,A,you have lost an hour it was only ten o clock when we came from tetbury
p00014_A,00014,A,that was very good natured of you
p00015_A,00015,A,oh d it when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend i hate to be pitiful
p00016_A,00016,A,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p00017_A,00017,A,shall you indeed that will be forty miles a day
p00018_A,00018,A,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00019_A,00019,A,i have never read it
p00020_A,00020,A,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p00021_A,00021,A,i assure you i would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world for if i did we should certainly be separated the whole evening
p00022_A,00022,A,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00023_A,00023,A,i beg your pardon miss morland for this liberty but i cannot anyhow get to miss thorpe and mrs thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you
p00024_A,00024,A,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not
p00025_A,00025,A,there you hear what your sister says and yet you will not mind her well remember that it is not my fault if we set all the old ladies in bath in a bustle come along my dearest catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me
p00026_A,00026,A,very agreeable madam
p00027_A,00027,A,i am glad of it john has charming spirits has not he
p00028_A,00028,A,where can he be
p00029_A,00029,A,i dare say she thought i was speaking of her son
p00030_A,00030,A,dearest catherine
p00031_A,00031,A,not expect me that s a good one and what a dust you would have made if i had not come
p00032_A,00032,A,my dearest creature you have been at least three hours getting ready i was afraid you were ill what a delightful ball we had last night i have a thousand things to say to you but make haste and get in for i long to be off
p00033_A,00033,A,past three o clock
p00034_A,00034,A,i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well
p00035_A,00035,A,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world
p00036_A,00036,A,do not be frightened my dear catherine but i am really going to dance with your brother again i declare positively it is quite shocking i tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance make haste my dear creature and come to us john is just walked off but he will be back in a moment
p00037_A,00037,A,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that
p00038_A,00038,A,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn
p00039_A,00039,A,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father
p00040_A,00040,A,my sweetest catherine is not this delightful we shall have a most heavenly drive you are to thank your brother and me for the scheme it darted into our heads at breakfast time i verily believe at the same instant and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain but it does not signify the nights are moonlight and we shall do delightfully oh i am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet so much better than going to the lower rooms we shall drive directly to clifton and dine there and as soon as dinner is over if there is time for it go on to kingsweston
p00041_A,00041,A,i doubt our being able to do so much
p00042_A,00042,A,by dozens
p00043_A,00043,A,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00044_A,00044,A,it is very odd but i suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk
p00045_A,00045,A,and well they might for i never saw so much dirt in my life walk you could no more walk than you could fly it has not been so dirty the whole winter it is ankle deep everywhere
p00046_A,00046,A,yes yes every hole and corner
p00047_A,00047,A,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00048_A,00048,A,then i will shall i go mrs allen
p00049_A,00049,A,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00050_A,00050,A,stop stop mr thorpe it is miss tilney it is indeed how could you tell me they were gone stop stop i will get out this moment and go to them pray pray stop mr thorpe i cannot go on i will not go on i must go back to miss tilney how could you deceive me so mr thorpe how could you say that you saw them driving up the lansdown road i would not have had it happen so for the world they must think it so strange so rude of me to go by them too without saying a word you do not know how vexed i am i shall have no pleasure at clifton nor in anything else i had rather ten thousand times rather get out now and walk back to them how could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton
p00051_A,00051,A,we had better go back thorpe it is too late to go on today your sister thinks so as well as i we have been exactly an hour coming from pulteney street very little more than seven miles and i suppose we have at least eight more to go it will never do we set out a great deal too late we had much better put it off till another day and turn round
p00052_A,00052,A,it is all one to me
p00053_A,00053,A,how i pity the poor creatures that are going there how glad i am that i am not amongst them i wonder whether it will be a full ball or not they have not begun dancing yet i would not be there for all the world it is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself i dare say it will not be a very good ball i know the mitchells will not be there i am sure i pity everybody that is but i dare say mr morland you long to be at it do not you i am sure you do well pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you i dare say we could do very well without you but you men think yourselves of such consequence
p00054_A,00054,A,go by all means my dear only put on a white gown miss tilney always wears white
p00055_A,00055,A,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00056_A,00056,A,my dear you tumble my gown
p00057_A,00057,A,i angry i could have no right
p00058_A,00058,A,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement
p00059_A,00059,A,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else
p00060_A,00060,A,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00061_A,00061,A,no no no
p00062_A,00062,A,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00063_A,00063,A,catherine you must go
p00064_A,00064,A,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00065_A,00065,A,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00066_A,00066,A,i suspect there is no great struggle
p00067_A,00067,A,you have not
p00068_A,00068,A,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey
p00069_A,00069,A,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00070_A,00070,A,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00071_A,00071,A,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i
p00072_A,00072,A,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related
p00073_A,00073,A,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted
p00074_A,00074,A,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade
p00075_A,00075,A,that is just what i was going to say
p00076_A,00076,A,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books
p00077_A,00077,A,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00078_A,00078,A,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world
p00079_A,00079,A,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding
p00080_A,00080,A,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00081_A,00081,A,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00082_A,00082,A,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00083_A,00083,A,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great
p00084_A,00084,A,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all
p00085_A,00085,A,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind
p00086_A,00086,A,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00087_A,00087,A,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot
p00088_A,00088,A,riot what riot
p00089_A,00089,A,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me
p00090_A,00090,A,she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper
p00091_A,00091,A,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us
p00092_A,00092,A,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria
p00093_A,00093,A,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better
p00094_A,00094,A,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour
p00095_A,00095,A,he is very handsome indeed
p00096_A,00096,A,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man
p00097_A,00097,A,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00098_A,00098,A,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living
p00099_A,00099,A,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in
p00100_A,00100,A,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world
p00101_A,00101,A,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month
p00102_A,00102,A,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way
p00103_A,00103,A,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction
p00104_A,00104,A,is it a pretty place
p00105_A,00105,A,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession
p00106_A,00106,A,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then
p00107_A,00107,A,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park
p00108_A,00108,A,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p00109_A,00109,A,our friends from fullerton
p00110_A,00110,A,eleanor
p00111_A,00111,A,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill
p00112_A,00112,A,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son
p00113_A,00113,A,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children
p00114_A,00114,A,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00115_A,00115,A,such a sister in law henry i should delight in
p00116_A,00116,A,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought
p00117_A,00117,A,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves
p00118_A,00118,A,but he will tell only half of it
p00119_A,00119,A,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us
p00120_A,00120,A,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return
p00121_A,00121,A,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains
p00122_A,00122,A,it is very right that you should stand by your brother
p00123_A,00123,A,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge
p00124_A,00124,A,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly
p00125_A,00125,A,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets
p00126_A,00126,A,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00127_A,00127,A,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p00128_A,00128,A,i really have not patience with the general
p00129_A,00129,A,do i oh perfectly
p00130_A,00130,A,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know
p00000_B,00000,B,how uncomfortable it is not to have a single acquaintance here
p00001_B,00001,B,very agreeable indeed
p00002_B,00002,B,i wish she had been able to dance i wish we could have got a partner for her i have been saying how glad i should be if the skinners were here this winter instead of last or if the parrys had come as they talked of once she might have danced with george parry i am so sorry she has not had a partner
p00003_B,00003,B,we shall do better another evening i hope
p00004_B,00004,B,you need not give yourself that trouble sir
p00005_B,00005,B,how can you be so
p00006_B,00006,B,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it
p00007_B,00007,B,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces
p00008_B,00008,B,i was not thinking of anything
p00009_B,00009,B,how glad i am we have met with mrs thorpe
p00010_B,00010,B,my dearest creature what can have made you so late i have been waiting for you at least this age
p00011_B,00011,B,have you indeed i am very sorry for it but really i thought i was in very good time it is but just one i hope you have not been here long
p00012_B,00012,B,five and twenty if it is an inch
p00013_B,00013,B,he does look very hot to be sure
p00014_B,00014,B,you will find however miss morland it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people for i might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day jackson of oriel bid me sixty at once morland was with me at the time
p00015_B,00015,B,yes but you forget that your horse was included
p00016_B,00016,B,yes very i have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one but i am particularly fond of it
p00017_B,00017,B,how delightful that will be my dearest catherine i quite envy you but i am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
p00018_B,00018,B,have you ever read udolpho mr thorpe
p00019_B,00019,B,ah mother how do you do where did you get that quiz of a hat it makes you look like an old witch here is morland and i come to stay a few days with you so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near
p00020_B,00020,B,i like him very much he seems very agreeable
p00021_B,00021,B,i am very happy to see you again sir indeed i was afraid you had left bath
p00022_B,00022,B,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him
p00023_B,00023,B,my dear isabella how was it possible for me to get at you i could not even see where you were
p00024_B,00024,B,no not at all but if you think it wrong you had much better change
p00025_B,00025,B,very agreeable madam
p00026_B,00026,B,did you meet mr tilney my dear
p00027_B,00027,B,no where is he
p00028_B,00028,B,indeed he is mrs allen i must say it though i am his mother that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world
p00029_B,00029,B,oh no i am much obliged to you our two dances are over and besides i am tired and do not mean to dance any more
p00030_B,00030,B,what do you mean where are you all going to
p00031_B,00031,B,do just as you please my dear
p00032_B,00032,B,you will not be frightened miss morland if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him old allen is as rich as a jew is not he old allen the man you are with
p00033_B,00033,B,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day
p00034_B,00034,B,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere
p00035_B,00035,B,how well your brother dances
p00036_B,00036,B,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me
p00037_B,00037,B,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours
p00038_B,00038,B,but they are such very different things
p00039_B,00039,B,how handsome a family they are
p00040_B,00040,B,you croaking fellow we shall be able to do ten times more kingsweston aye and blaize castle too and anything else we can hear of but here is your sister says she will not go
p00041_B,00041,B,blaize castle what is that
p00042_B,00042,B,not go my beloved creature what do you mean
p00043_B,00043,B,not they indeed for as we turned into broad street i saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts
p00044_B,00044,B,my dearest catherine you cannot form an idea of the dirt come you must go you cannot refuse going now
p00045_B,00045,B,i should like to see the castle but may we go all over it may we go up every staircase and into every suite of rooms
p00046_B,00046,B,make yourself easy there is no danger of that for i heard tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback that they were going as far as wick rocks
p00047_B,00047,B,just as you please my dear well my dear suppose you go
p00048_B,00048,B,who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by
p00049_B,00049,B,who where
p00050_B,00050,B,it is all one to me
p00051_B,00051,B,if your brother had not got such a d beast to drive we might have done it very well my horse would have trotted to clifton within the hour if left to himself and i have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken winded jade s pace morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own
p00052_B,00052,B,no he is not for i am sure he could not afford it
p00053_B,00053,B,mrs allen will there be any harm in my calling on miss tilney today i shall not be easy till i have explained everything
p00054_B,00054,B,oh mr tilney i have been quite wild to speak to you and make my apologies you must have thought me so rude but indeed it was not my own fault was it mrs allen did not they tell me that mr tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together and then what could i do but i had ten thousand times rather have been with you now had not i mrs allen
p00055_B,00055,B,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose
p00056_B,00056,B,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there
p00057_B,00057,B,how came mr thorpe to know your father
p00058_B,00058,B,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse
p00059_B,00059,B,no no no
p00060_B,00060,B,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing
p00061_B,00061,B,catherine you must go
p00062_B,00062,B,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go
p00063_B,00063,B,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you
p00064_B,00064,B,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
p00065_B,00065,B,i suspect there is no great struggle
p00066_B,00066,B,you have not
p00067_B,00067,B,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
p00068_B,00068,B,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it
p00069_B,00069,B,let her go let her go if she will go
p00070_B,00070,B,she is as obstinate as
p00071_B,00071,B,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself
p00072_B,00072,B,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong
p00073_B,00073,B,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more
p00074_B,00074,B,that is just what i was going to say
p00075_B,00075,B,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france
p00076_B,00076,B,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it
p00077_B,00077,B,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly
p00078_B,00078,B,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way
p00079_B,00079,B,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so
p00080_B,00080,B,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word
p00081_B,00081,B,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading
p00082_B,00082,B,to say the truth i do not much like any other
p00083_B,00083,B,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous
p00084_B,00084,B,indeed and of what nature
p00085_B,00085,B,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit
p00086_B,00086,B,riot what riot
p00087_B,00087,B,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general
p00088_B,00088,B,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways
p00089_B,00089,B,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go
p00090_B,00090,B,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james
p00091_B,00091,B,indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it
p00092_B,00092,B,shall not you be late at devizes
p00093_B,00093,B,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil
p00094_B,00094,B,then why did not you
p00095_B,00095,B,it is very charming indeed
p00096_B,00096,B,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
p00097_B,00097,B,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection
p00098_B,00098,B,by the end of another week
p00099_B,00099,B,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not
p00100_B,00100,B,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here
p00101_B,00101,B,but how can that be are not you with her
p00102_B,00102,B,how much better is this how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one
p00103_B,00103,B,is it a pretty place
p00104_B,00104,B,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
p00105_B,00105,B,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it
p00106_B,00106,B,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp
p00107_B,00107,B,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now
p00108_B,00108,B,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction
p00109_B,00109,B,it remains as it was i suppose
p00110_B,00110,B,mr tilney good god how came you here how came you up that staircase
p00111_B,00111,B,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings
p00112_B,00112,B,what was her father
p00113_B,00113,B,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise
p00114_B,00114,B,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant
p00115_B,00115,B,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals
p00116_B,00116,B,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story
p00117_B,00117,B,but he will tell only half of it
p00118_B,00118,B,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days
p00119_B,00119,B,go away and why
p00120_B,00120,B,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world
p00121_B,00121,B,it will soon be as if you never had
p00122_B,00122,B,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long
p00123_B,00123,B,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again
p00124_B,00124,B,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping
p00125_B,00125,B,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor
p00126_B,00126,B,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself
p00127_B,00127,B,i really have not patience with the general only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first
p00128_B,00128,B,yes but that did not last long
p00129_B,00129,B,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful
p00130_B,00130,B,her head did not run upon bath much
