p00006_A,00006,A,perhaps but later
p00007_A,00007,A,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00008_A,00008,A,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00009_A,00009,A,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please

p00011_A,00011,A,why no there are six people present in my small room already please remain seated if you will excuse the informality
p00012_A,00012,A,cyril again you desert
p00013_A,00013,A,my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke
p00014_A,00014,A,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00015_A,00015,A,but not in an indian state
p00016_A,00016,A,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00017_A,00017,A,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00018_A,00018,A,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00019_A,00019,A,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00020_A,00020,A,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00021_A,00021,A,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00022_A,00022,A,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00023_A,00023,A,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00024_A,00024,A,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00025_A,00025,A,do not apologize you are always late
p00026_A,00026,A,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00027_A,00027,A,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00028_A,00028,A,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00029_A,00029,A,come and see my wife a little then
p00030_A,00030,A,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00031_A,00031,A,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00032_A,00032,A,some case i daresay
p00033_A,00033,A,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00034_A,00034,A,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00035_A,00035,A,aziz he is trying to pull your leg don t believe him the villain
p00036_A,00036,A,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00037_A,00037,A,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00038_A,00038,A,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00039_A,00039,A,oh that is going much too far
p00040_A,00040,A,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00041_A,00041,A,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00042_A,00042,A,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00043_A,00043,A,when miss quested stopped in the college fielding used to visit her rather too late in the evening the servants say
p00044_A,00044,A,but you understand my meaning
p00045_A,00045,A,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00046_A,00046,A,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00047_A,00047,A,no let us surprise them without warning far too much nonsense still goes on among our ladies they pretended at the time of your trial they would give up purdah indeed those of them who can write composed a document to that effect and now it ends in humbug you know how deeply they all respect fielding but not one of them has seen him my wife says she will but always when he calls there is some excuse she is not feeling well she is ashamed of the room she has no nice sweets to offer him only elephants ears and if i say elephants ears are mr fielding s favourite sweet she replies that he will know how badly hers are made so she cannot see him on their account for fifteen years my dear boy have i argued with my begum for fifteen years and never gained a point yet the missionaries inform us our women are down trodden if you want a subject for a poem take this the indian lady as she is and not as she is supposed to be
p00048_A,00048,A,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00049_A,00049,A,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00050_A,00050,A,why isn t cyril following let us turn back
p00051_A,00051,A,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00052_A,00052,A,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00053_A,00053,A,they are torturing him
p00054_A,00054,A,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00055_A,00055,A,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00056_A,00056,A,well look at my own experience this morning
p00057_A,00057,A,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00058_A,00058,A,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00059_A,00059,A,did you not know that when they were lent to central india over a canal scheme some rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in solid gold so that the water should run through his state
p00060_A,00060,A,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00061_A,00061,A,queen victoria was different
p00062_A,00062,A,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00063_A,00063,A,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00064_A,00064,A,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00065_A,00065,A,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00066_A,00066,A,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00067_A,00067,A,and does it
p00068_A,00068,A,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00069_A,00069,A,no no i do not admit that i have met others
p00070_A,00070,A,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00071_A,00071,A,she said in the most natural way she offered me a lozenge when the dust irritated my throat
p00072_A,00072,A,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00073_A,00073,A,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00074_A,00074,A,mrs lesley it is a tonga
p00075_A,00075,A,o tonga wallah club club why doesn t the fool go
p00076_A,00076,A,i say is he ill or isn t he ill
p00077_A,00077,A,saying nothing then i will write him a letter tell him i have called that is sufficient here is my card call me a tonga
p00078_A,00078,A,huzoor all are at the club
p00079_A,00079,A,madam madam madam
p00080_A,00080,A,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00081_A,00081,A,you have
p00082_A,00082,A,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00083_A,00083,A,of course but so few ladies take the trouble especially if thinking no one is there to see
p00084_A,00084,A,oh can i do you some service now or at any time
p00085_A,00085,A,may i know your name
p00086_A,00086,A,mrs mrs moore i am afraid i startled you i shall tell my community our friends about you that god is here very good very fine indeed i think you are newly arrived in india
p00087_A,00087,A,by the way you address me no but can i call you a carriage
p00088_A,00088,A,what was the name of the play
p00089_A,00089,A,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00090_A,00090,A,oh i am used to it
p00091_A,00091,A,i m a doctor snakes don t dare bite me please may i ask you a question now why do you come to india at this time of year just as the cold weather is ending
p00092_A,00092,A,it will soon be so unhealthy for you and why ever do you come to chandrapore
p00093_A,00093,A,oh no excuse me that is quite impossible our city magistrate s name is mr heaslop i know him intimately
p00094_A,00094,A,but mrs moore how can he be
p00095_A,00095,A,yes now i see and your first husband died
p00096_A,00096,A,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00097_A,00097,A,and the gentleman here is he ralph and stella s half brother
p00098_A,00098,A,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance

p00100_A,00100,A,would you care to see over the minto hospital one morning i have nothing else to offer at chandrapore
p00101_A,00101,A,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00102_A,00102,A,ah a very charming lady
p00103_A,00103,A,what what you didn t like her
p00104_A,00104,A,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00105_A,00105,A,there honestly is none we are by nature a most informal people
p00106_A,00106,A,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00107_A,00107,A,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00108_A,00108,A,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00109_A,00109,A,how is that oh explain to me
p00110_A,00110,A,do you ever remember our mosque mrs moore
p00111_A,00111,A,and how rough and rude i was and how good you were
p00112_A,00112,A,certainly miss quested so you and i will go together and leave mrs moore here and we will not be long yet we will not hurry because we know that will be her wish
p00113_A,00113,A,dear mrs moore what does anything matter so long as you are my guests i am very glad you are not coming which sounds strange but you are treating me with true frankness as a friend yes i am your friend so may i make another suggestion don t let so many people come with you this time i think you may find it more convenient exactly exactly is that all right
p00114_A,00114,A,oh oh
p00115_A,00115,A,i have taken them off
p00116_A,00116,A,i left them at the entrance

p00123_A,00123,A,cousin kate
p00124_A,00124,A,but you walk about yourself
p00125_A,00125,A,used to snakes
p00126_A,00126,A,i intended to start earlier but there was an unavoidable delay
p00127_A,00127,A,to visit my son he is the city magistrate here
p00128_A,00128,A,he s my son all the same
p00129_A,00129,A,i was married twice
p00130_A,00130,A,he did and so did my second husband
p00131_A,00131,A,no there are the younger ones ralph and stella in england
p00132_A,00132,A,quite right
p00133_A,00133,A,what are their names not also ronny ralph and stella surely
p00134_A,00134,A,i do
p00135_A,00135,A,thank you i have seen it already or i should have liked to come with you very much
p00136_A,00136,A,yes and mrs callendar
p00137_A,00137,A,possibly when one knows her better
p00138_A,00138,A,she was certainly intending to be kind but i did not find her exactly charming
p00139_A,00139,A,i don t think i understand people very well i only know whether i like or dislike them
p00140_A,00140,A,i am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence
p00141_A,00141,A,india s oh what an alarming idea
p00142_A,00142,A,rupees don t last for ever i m afraid
p00143_A,00143,A,good bye dr aziz
p00144_A,00144,A,get in get in you ll kill yourself as well as mr fielding i see no ruin
p00145_A,00145,A,i do i do
p00146_A,00146,A,and how happy we both were
p00147_A,00147,A,quite right i m sorry not to come too but i m a poor walker
p00148_A,00148,A,aziz where have you put miss quested to
p00149_A,00149,A,i want to see the real india
p00150_A,00150,A,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00151_A,00151,A,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00152_A,00152,A,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00153_A,00153,A,was he nice
p00154_A,00154,A,i dislike them not because i m english but from my own personal point of view
p00155_A,00155,A,and nasty
p00156_A,00156,A,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00157_A,00157,A,i suppose so
p00158_A,00158,A,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00159_A,00159,A,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00160_A,00160,A,what made you call it a ghost
p00161_A,00161,A,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00162_A,00162,A,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00163_A,00163,A,what a nice cheerful servant what a relief after antony
p00164_A,00164,A,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00165_A,00165,A,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00166_A,00166,A,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00167_A,00167,A,oh yes that s true
p00168_A,00168,A,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00169_A,00169,A,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00170_A,00170,A,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00171_A,00171,A,a snake it isn t a snake
p00172_A,00172,A,mrs moore may i put our difficulty to dr aziz i mean our anglo indian one
p00173_A,00173,A,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00174_A,00174,A,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00175_A,00175,A,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00176_A,00176,A,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00177_A,00177,A,i can t get rid of it
p00178_A,00178,A,mrs moore what is this echo
p00179_A,00179,A,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00180_A,00180,A,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00181_A,00181,A,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00182_A,00182,A,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00183_A,00183,A,i know but
p00184_A,00184,A,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00185_A,00185,A,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00186_A,00186,A,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00187_A,00187,A,ah yes so the young man there said
p00188_A,00188,A,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00189_A,00189,A,i believe that you have oh please it distresses me beyond words
p00190_A,00190,A,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00191_A,00191,A,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00192_A,00192,A,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00193_A,00193,A,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00194_A,00194,A,that s much the best feeling to have
p00195_A,00195,A,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00196_A,00196,A,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00197_A,00197,A,india s
p00198_A,00198,A,call what a ghost
p00199_A,00199,A,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00200_A,00200,A,we shall be all moslems together now as you promised
p00201_A,00201,A,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00202_A,00202,A,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00203_A,00203,A,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00204_A,00204,A,she has children you see
p00205_A,00205,A,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00206_A,00206,A,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00207_A,00207,A,only various shades of the dark
p00208_A,00208,A,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00209_A,00209,A,i forget
p00210_A,00210,A,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00211_A,00211,A,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00212_A,00212,A,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00213_A,00213,A,oh what of the echo
p00214_A,00214,A,i don t suppose you ever will
p00215_A,00215,A,don t you know
p00216_A,00216,A,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00217_A,00217,A,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00218_A,00218,A,i never said his name
p00219_A,00219,A,of course he is innocent
p00220_A,00220,A,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00221_A,00221,A,come india s not as bad as all that other side of the earth if you like but we stick to the same old moon
p00222_A,00222,A,listen mohammed latif says good morning next
p00223_A,00223,A,fielding how s one to see the real india
p00224_A,00224,A,i say old man do excuse me but i think perhaps you oughtn t to have left miss quested alone
p00225_A,00225,A,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p00226_A,00226,A,yes that s all right in england
p00227_A,00227,A,if you can t see you can t see can t you see that fellow s a bounder
p00228_A,00228,A,what should have upset his precious nerves
p00229_A,00229,A,well it s nothing i ve said i never even spoke to him
p00230_A,00230,A,fielding don t think i m taking it badly or anything of that sort i suppose you won t come on to the polo with us we should all be delighted
p00231_A,00231,A,let him go
p00232_A,00232,A,i came to bring miss quested away but her visit to the turtons has ended and there is no other arrangement so far mine are bachelor quarters now
p00233_A,00233,A,i wish to thank you for the help you have given miss quested she will not of course trespass on your hospitality further she has as a matter of fact decided to return to england i have just arranged about her passage for her i understand she would like to see you
p00234_A,00234,A,who was that
p00235_A,00235,A,yes indeed
p00236_A,00236,A,our schoolmaster government college
p00237_A,00237,A,das is really
p00238_A,00238,A,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00239_A,00239,A,oh lucky you
p00240_A,00240,A,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00241_A,00241,A,let me explain natives don t respect one any the more after meeting one you see
p00242_A,00242,A,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00243_A,00243,A,that occurs after so many meetings
p00244_A,00244,A,even from one s patients
p00245_A,00245,A,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00246_A,00246,A,how if he went to heaven
p00247_A,00247,A,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00248_A,00248,A,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00249_A,00249,A,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00250_A,00250,A,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00251_A,00251,A,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p00252_A,00252,A,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00253_A,00253,A,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00254_A,00254,A,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00255_A,00255,A,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00256_A,00256,A,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00257_A,00257,A,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00258_A,00258,A,to work mary to work
p00259_A,00259,A,come along mary get it over
p00260_A,00260,A,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00261_A,00261,A,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00262_A,00262,A,everything absolutely normal
p00263_A,00263,A,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00264_A,00264,A,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p00265_A,00265,A,she s saying her prayers
p00266_A,00266,A,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00267_A,00267,A,you won t
p00268_A,00268,A,mcbryde s an old woman
p00269_A,00269,A,miss quested what a name
p00270_A,00270,A,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00271_A,00271,A,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00272_A,00272,A,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00273_A,00273,A,harry is there any news from the city
p00274_A,00274,A,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00275_A,00275,A,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00276_A,00276,A,miss quested adela what d ye call yourself it s half past seven we ought to think of starting for that court when you feel inclined
p00277_A,00277,A,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00278_A,00278,A,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00279_A,00279,A,it s decent of the burra sahib do you know he s never given a bridge party before coming on top of the dinner too i wish i could have arranged something myself but when you know the natives better you ll realize it s easier for the burra sahib than for me they know him they know he can t be fooled i m still fresh comparatively no one can even begin to think of knowing this country until he has been in it twenty years hullo the mater here s your cloak well for an example of the mistakes one makes soon after i came out i asked one of the pleaders to have a smoke with me only a cigarette mind i found afterwards that he had sent touts all over the bazaar to announce the fact told all the litigants ever since then i ve dropped on him in court as hard as i could it s taught me a lesson and i hope him
p00280_A,00280,A,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00281_A,00281,A,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00282_A,00282,A,you oughtn t to have answered
p00283_A,00283,A,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00284_A,00284,A,what s happened to fielding where s my mother
p00285_A,00285,A,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00286_A,00286,A,what was that about caves
p00287_A,00287,A,out where
p00288_A,00288,A,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00289_A,00289,A,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00290_A,00290,A,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00291_A,00291,A,no but i know all about them naturally
p00292_A,00292,A,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00293_A,00293,A,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00294_A,00294,A,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00295_A,00295,A,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00296_A,00296,A,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00297_A,00297,A,as we are british i suppose it is
p00298_A,00298,A,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00299_A,00299,A,i know we shall
p00300_A,00300,A,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00301_A,00301,A,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00302_A,00302,A,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00303_A,00303,A,frightened adela
p00304_A,00304,A,wasn t the bridge we skidded
p00305_A,00305,A,i say adela what was it
p00306_A,00306,A,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00307_A,00307,A,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00308_A,00308,A,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion
p00309_A,00309,A,dear old girl to say so
p00310_A,00310,A,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00311_A,00311,A,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00312_A,00312,A,well my dear girl this isn t much of a home coming i had no idea she had this up her sleeve
p00313_A,00313,A,you re over tired
p00314_A,00314,A,well sit down anyhow
p00315_A,00315,A,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00316_A,00316,A,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00317_A,00317,A,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00318_A,00318,A,heard what
p00319_A,00319,A,mother never said so
p00320_A,00320,A,she never mentioned that name once
p00321_A,00321,A,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00322_A,00322,A,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00323_A,00323,A,those words
p00324_A,00324,A,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00325_A,00325,A,you were not right she never said it
p00326_A,00326,A,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00327_A,00327,A,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00328_A,00328,A,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00329_A,00329,A,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00330_A,00330,A,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00331_A,00331,A,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00332_A,00332,A,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00333_A,00333,A,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00334_A,00334,A,good evening
p00335_A,00335,A,i thought there was to be no polo
p00336_A,00336,A,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00337_A,00337,A,the marabar caves
p00338_A,00338,A,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00339_A,00339,A,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00340_A,00340,A,have you been to them
p00341_A,00341,A,oh naturally
p00342_A,00342,A,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00343_A,00343,A,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00344_A,00344,A,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00345_A,00345,A,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00346_A,00346,A,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00347_A,00347,A,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00348_A,00348,A,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00349_A,00349,A,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00350_A,00350,A,i think we shall keep friends
p00351_A,00351,A,quite so
p00352_A,00352,A,good gracious no
p00353_A,00353,A,how do you do
p00354_A,00354,A,i think perhaps i ought to see your mother and discuss future plans
p00355_A,00355,A,a large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us
p00356_A,00356,A,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p00357_A,00357,A,ronny i should like to take back what i said on the maidan
p00358_A,00358,A,what does our old gentleman of the car think
p00359_A,00359,A,have i really
p00360_A,00360,A,what animal
p00361_A,00361,A,can mrs moore be with me
p00362_A,00362,A,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00363_A,00363,A,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00364_A,00364,A,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00365_A,00365,A,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00366_A,00366,A,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00367_A,00367,A,my echo s better
p00368_A,00368,A,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00369_A,00369,A,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00370_A,00370,A,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00371_A,00371,A,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00372_A,00372,A,didn t she
p00373_A,00373,A,but ronny i heard her
p00374_A,00374,A,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00375_A,00375,A,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00376_A,00376,A,the idea more than the words
p00377_A,00377,A,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00378_A,00378,A,you see ronny i was right
p00379_A,00379,A,but she thinks it
p00380_A,00380,A,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00381_A,00381,A,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00382_A,00382,A,not allowed
p00383_A,00383,A,been there when
p00384_A,00384,A,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00385_A,00385,A,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00386_A,00386,A,who was he
p00387_A,00387,A,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00388_A,00388,A,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00389_A,00389,A,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00390_A,00390,A,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00391_A,00391,A,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00392_A,00392,A,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00393_A,00393,A,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00394_A,00394,A,yes rather i must in fact
p00395_A,00395,A,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00396_A,00396,A,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00397_A,00397,A,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00398_A,00398,A,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00399_A,00399,A,india isn t home
p00400_A,00400,A,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00401_A,00401,A,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00402_A,00402,A,i know
p00403_A,00403,A,does adela talk to you much i m so driven with work i don t see her as much as i hoped but i hope she finds things comfortable
p00404_A,00404,A,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00405_A,00405,A,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00406_A,00406,A,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00407_A,00407,A,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00408_A,00408,A,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00409_A,00409,A,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00410_A,00410,A,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00411_A,00411,A,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00412_A,00412,A,india likes gods
p00413_A,00413,A,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00414_A,00414,A,how do you make that out mother
p00415_A,00415,A,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00416_A,00416,A,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00417_A,00417,A,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00418_A,00418,A,look here both of you see india if you like and as you like i know i made myself rather ridiculous at fielding s but it s different now i wasn t quite sure of myself
p00419_A,00419,A,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00420_A,00420,A,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00421_A,00421,A,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00422_A,00422,A,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00423_A,00423,A,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00424_A,00424,A,we can go into that later can t we
p00425_A,00425,A,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00426_A,00426,A,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00427_A,00427,A,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00428_A,00428,A,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00429_A,00429,A,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00430_A,00430,A,who cares what she thinks
p00431_A,00431,A,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00432_A,00432,A,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00433_A,00433,A,feeble mother feeble
p00434_A,00434,A,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00435_A,00435,A,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00436_A,00436,A,between the acts
p00437_A,00437,A,can t mother
p00438_A,00438,A,very nice
p00439_A,00439,A,a doctor i don t know his name
p00440_A,00440,A,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00441_A,00441,A,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00442_A,00442,A,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00443_A,00443,A,aziz what a charming name
p00444_A,00444,A,yes quite after the first moment
p00445_A,00445,A,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00446_A,00446,A,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00447_A,00447,A,but my dear boy
p00448_A,00448,A,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00449_A,00449,A,how not true
p00450_A,00450,A,i don t know what you mean dear
p00451_A,00451,A,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00452_A,00452,A,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00453_A,00453,A,not talk about him why
p00454_A,00454,A,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00455_A,00455,A,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00456_A,00456,A,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00457_A,00457,A,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00458_A,00458,A,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00459_A,00459,A,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00460_A,00460,A,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00461_A,00461,A,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00462_A,00462,A,what do you mean
p00463_A,00463,A,your sentiments are those of a god
p00464_A,00464,A,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00465_A,00465,A,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00466_A,00466,A,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00467_A,00467,A,the desire to behave pleasantly satisfies god the sincere if impotent desire wins his blessing i think every one fails but there are so many kinds of failure good will and more good will and more good will though i speak with the tongues of
p00468_A,00468,A,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00469_A,00469,A,an accident
p00470_A,00470,A,a ghost
p00471_A,00471,A,here you are both back
p00472_A,00472,A,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00473_A,00473,A,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00474_A,00474,A,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00475_A,00475,A,why should i be in the witness box
p00476_A,00476,A,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00477_A,00477,A,i have changed my mind
p00478_A,00478,A,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00479_A,00479,A,i want my pack of patience cards
p00480_A,00480,A,red nine on black ten
p00481_A,00481,A,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00482_A,00482,A,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00483_A,00483,A,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00484_A,00484,A,most feeble
p00485_A,00485,A,it is owing to orders from the l g turton would never do this unless compelled those high officials are different they sympathize the viceroy sympathizes they would have us treated properly but they come too seldom and live too far away meanwhile
p00486_A,00486,A,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00487_A,00487,A,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00488_A,00488,A,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00489_A,00489,A,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00490_A,00490,A,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00491_A,00491,A,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p00492_A,00492,A,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00493_A,00493,A,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00494_A,00494,A,you will make yourself chip
p00495_A,00495,A,mr mahmoud ali
p00496_A,00496,A,mr ram chand
p00497_A,00497,A,it is only just five my husband will be up from his office in a moment and start the thing i have no idea what we have to do it s the first time we ve ever given a party like this at the club mr heaslop when i m dead and gone will you give parties like this it s enough to make the old type of burra sahib turn in his grave
p00498_A,00498,A,absolutely true
p00499_A,00499,A,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p00500_A,00500,A,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00501_A,00501,A,i didn t mean that
p00502_A,00502,A,well done das quite sound
p00503_A,00503,A,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00504_A,00504,A,you re superior to them anyway don t forget that you re superior to everyone in india except one or two of the ranis and they re on an equality is that what you wanted
p00505_A,00505,A,oh yes they re english speaking
p00506_A,00506,A,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00507_A,00507,A,i should think i did champagne too
p00508_A,00508,A,how about aspirin
p00509_A,00509,A,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00510_A,00510,A,yes my dear child
p00511_A,00511,A,this isn t a purdah party
p00512_A,00512,A,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00513_A,00513,A,but mrs turton
p00514_A,00514,A,oh really
p00515_A,00515,A,do kindly tell us who these ladies are
p00516_A,00516,A,perhaps we speak yours a little
p00517_A,00517,A,eastbourne piccadilly high park corner
p00518_A,00518,A,no of course not and anyhow they re not coming to the club
p00519_A,00519,A,she knows paris also
p00520_A,00520,A,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00521_A,00521,A,the shorter lady she is my wife she is mrs bhattacharya the taller lady she is my sister she is mrs das
p00522_A,00522,A,no of course not we are not such people
p00523_A,00523,A,whenever is convenient
p00524_A,00524,A,we shall enjoy it greatly it would be a real pleasure what about the time
p00525_A,00525,A,most certainly
p00526_A,00526,A,all hours
p00527_A,00527,A,we leave for calcutta to day
p00528_A,00528,A,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00529_A,00529,A,yes yes you come to us thursday
p00530_A,00530,A,but you ll be in calcutta
p00531_A,00531,A,you can t have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for our sake
p00532_A,00532,A,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00533_A,00533,A,much the best thing to be in this place
p00534_A,00534,A,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00535_A,00535,A,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00536_A,00536,A,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00537_A,00537,A,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday
p00538_A,00538,A,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00539_A,00539,A,i do so hate mysteries
p00540_A,00540,A,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00541_A,00541,A,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00542_A,00542,A,i don t know
p00543_A,00543,A,i shall walk
p00544_A,00544,A,ought i to join them
p00545_A,00545,A,but where am i to go in it
p00546_A,00546,A,a sort of interview have you any explanation of my extraordinary behaviour
p00547_A,00547,A,why indeed
p00548_A,00548,A,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00549_A,00549,A,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00550_A,00550,A,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00551_A,00551,A,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00552_A,00552,A,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00553_A,00553,A,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00554_A,00554,A,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00555_A,00555,A,will it
p00556_A,00556,A,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00557_A,00557,A,how can that be
p00558_A,00558,A,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00559_A,00559,A,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00560_A,00560,A,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00561_A,00561,A,because the dead don t live again
p00562_A,00562,A,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00563_A,00563,A,the guide
p00564_A,00564,A,perhaps it was the guide
p00565_A,00565,A,i hope to leave in a moment don t let me interrupt
p00566_A,00566,A,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00567_A,00567,A,he may not even know i m here
p00568_A,00568,A,perfectly right
p00569_A,00569,A,mr fielding has ronny told you of this new misfortune ah me
p00570_A,00570,A,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00571_A,00571,A,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00572_A,00572,A,of course i ought to have thought of it myself my instincts never help me why didn t i rush up to him after the trial yes of course i will write him an apology but please will you dictate it shall i write another nothing matters if i can undo the harm i have caused i can do this right and that right but when the two are put together they come wrong that s the defect of my character i have never realized it until now i thought that if i was just and asked questions i would come through every difficulty
p00573_A,00573,A,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00574_A,00574,A,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00575_A,00575,A,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it
p00576_A,00576,A,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00577_A,00577,A,telepathy possibly
p00578_A,00578,A,i shall often you have been excessively kind now that i m going i realize it i wish i could do something for you in return but i see you ve all you want
p00579_A,00579,A,of course this death has been troubling me
p00580_A,00580,A,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00581_A,00581,A,so do i
p00582_A,00582,A,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00583_A,00583,A,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00584_A,00584,A,i m rather a hermit you know
p00585_A,00585,A,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00586_A,00586,A,do you care to meet one or two
p00587_A,00587,A,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00588_A,00588,A,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00589_A,00589,A,i won t ask the city magistrate to bring you i know he ll be busy at that time
p00590_A,00590,A,some misunderstanding
p00591_A,00591,A,i wouldn t worry about that
p00592_A,00592,A,that s a notion
p00593_A,00593,A,we english do
p00594_A,00594,A,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00595_A,00595,A,i suppose so
p00596_A,00596,A,good bye mrs moore
p00597_A,00597,A,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p00598_A,00598,A,you can t wander about like that where s the car you came in
p00599_A,00599,A,what madness there s supposed to be a riot on the police have struck no one knows what ll happen next why don t you keep to your own people
p00600_A,00600,A,i m coming back this way and don t argue excuse manners but i don t know anyone s position send my carriage back any time to morrow if you please
p00601_A,00601,A,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00602_A,00602,A,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00603_A,00603,A,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00604_A,00604,A,not much
p00605_A,00605,A,what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination
p00606_A,00606,A,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00607_A,00607,A,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00608_A,00608,A,you put it honestly anyhow
p00609_A,00609,A,it ll get us to heaven
p00610_A,00610,A,if heaven existed
p00611_A,00611,A,i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there
p00612_A,00612,A,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00613_A,00613,A,i don t go to that length
p00614_A,00614,A,she s an old lady
p00615_A,00615,A,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00616_A,00616,A,i fear not
p00617_A,00617,A,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else
p00618_A,00618,A,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00619_A,00619,A,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00620_A,00620,A,at once
p00621_A,00621,A,gladly in a minute
p00622_A,00622,A,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p00623_A,00623,A,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00624_A,00624,A,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p00625_A,00625,A,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00626_A,00626,A,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00627_A,00627,A,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00628_A,00628,A,i shall go round at once
p00629_A,00629,A,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00630_A,00630,A,i no longer want love
p00631_A,00631,A,but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air
p00632_A,00632,A,how could she have known what we don t
p00633_A,00633,A,write to me when you get to england
p00634_A,00634,A,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00635_A,00635,A,aziz was so fond of her too
p00636_A,00636,A,don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit
p00637_A,00637,A,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00638_A,00638,A,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00639_A,00639,A,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00640_A,00640,A,if one couldn t see the laughable side of these people one ld be done for
p00641_A,00641,A,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00642_A,00642,A,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p00643_A,00643,A,what can you expect from the fellow no grits no guts
p00644_A,00644,A,bust in front of the cow hospital did it and how did you come to be there
p00645_A,00645,A,oh lord oh lord when i live here and you live there not ten minutes from me and the cow hospital is right ever so far away the other side of you there then how did you come to be passing the cow hospital on the way to me now do some work for a change
p00646_A,00646,A,sir excuse me i did i mounted my bike and it bust in front of the cow hospital so i had to find a tonga
p00647_A,00647,A,i beg your pardon
p00648_A,00648,A,disaster may come but we shall at all events get there safe even if we do not get back it will i think create a good impression should two doctors arrive at the same time
p00649_A,00649,A,dr aziz dr aziz where you been i waited ten full minutes time at your house then i went
p00650_A,00650,A,post office do you not send your servants
p00651_A,00651,A,your servant spoke to me i saw your servant
p00652_A,00652,A,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00653_A,00653,A,it is fine to be young damn well oh very fine damn whom

p00682_A,00682,A,miss quested
p00683_A,00683,A,you can talk to miss quested about the peacock throne if you like she s artistic they say
p00684_A,00684,A,post impressionism indeed come along to tea this world is getting too much for me altogether
p00685_A,00685,A,besides the ladies i am expecting one of my assistants narayan godbole
p00686_A,00686,A,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00687_A,00687,A,why don t you fellows run a club in chandrapore aziz
p00688_A,00688,A,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p00689_A,00689,A,well are you
p00690_A,00690,A,you re sure i don t tire you by stopping
p00691_A,00691,A,anyhow you want to rest
p00692_A,00692,A,callendar doesn t trust anyone english or indian that s his character and i wish you weren t under him but you are and that s that
p00693_A,00693,A,who is this
p00694_A,00694,A,really i don t know why you pay me this great compliment aziz but i do appreciate it
p00695_A,00695,A,you would have allowed me to see her
p00696_A,00696,A,did she think they were your brothers
p00697_A,00697,A,and when the whole world behaves as such there will be no more purdah
p00698_A,00698,A,it s beginning at the wrong end isn t it i know but institutions and the governments don t
p00699_A,00699,A,how did you like the two ladies you met last thursday how do you like englishwomen generally
p00700_A,00700,A,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00701_A,00701,A,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00702_A,00702,A,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00703_A,00703,A,it must
p00704_A,00704,A,i don t care for children
p00705_A,00705,A,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00706_A,00706,A,good god why the girl s a prig
p00707_A,00707,A,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00708_A,00708,A,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00709_A,00709,A,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00710_A,00710,A,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00711_A,00711,A,i may have got it wrong i m out of club gossip but anyhow they re engaged to be married
p00712_A,00712,A,no you won t
p00713_A,00713,A,to whom
p00714_A,00714,A,thanks for telling me that yes i must try and be more careful if i m interested i m apt to forget myself still it doesn t do real harm
p00715_A,00715,A,it s often done so in the past
p00716_A,00716,A,if i do i do i shall survive it i travel light
p00717_A,00717,A,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00718_A,00718,A,very much
p00719_A,00719,A,i never can be in trouble
p00720_A,00720,A,godbole s pujah did it
p00721_A,00721,A,i m all right you re all right don t worry
p00722_A,00722,A,aziz can i have a drink
p00723_A,00723,A,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00724_A,00724,A,chandrapore the man s made a mistake
p00725_A,00725,A,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p00726_A,00726,A,aziz exactly where and how did you leave miss quested
p00727_A,00727,A,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00728_A,00728,A,is there a path off the top
p00729_A,00729,A,but you saw them get down safe
p00730_A,00730,A,then the guide came back to you
p00731_A,00731,A,i hope she wasn t ill
p00732_A,00732,A,yes that sounds sense
p00733_A,00733,A,aziz have you figured out what this picnic will cost you
p00734_A,00734,A,i told you he s no good
p00735_A,00735,A,aziz how monstrous
p00736_A,00736,A,my proverbs are a penny saved is a penny earned a stitch in time saves nine look before you leap and the british empire rests on them you will never kick us out you know until you cease employing m l s and such
p00737_A,00737,A,but you do you take them to a picnic
p00738_A,00738,A,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p00739_A,00739,A,you can t it s too late how are you to get round to the private entrance now come this way with me quick i ll put you into my carriage
p00740_A,00740,A,aziz are you awake
p00741_A,00741,A,i am useless at dreaming
p00742_A,00742,A,are you
p00743_A,00743,A,there ll be a general move at chandrapore
p00744_A,00744,A,they can t well move me down whatever their feelings
p00745_A,00745,A,you have won a great victory
p00746_A,00746,A,including knowing me
p00747_A,00747,A,yes certainly you must let off miss quested easily she must pay all your costs that is only fair but do not treat her like a conquered enemy
p00748_A,00748,A,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here
p00749_A,00749,A,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00750_A,00750,A,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one
p00751_A,00751,A,she ll apologize if that s the trouble look i ll make you an offer dictate to me whatever form of words you like and this time to morrow i ll bring it back signed this is not instead of any public apology she may make you in law it s an addition
p00752_A,00752,A,well good night good night it s time to go to sleep after that
p00753_A,00753,A,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00754_A,00754,A,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00755_A,00755,A,let us discuss that to morrow morning
p00756_A,00756,A,to whom
p00757_A,00757,A,i have not heard of other children
p00758_A,00758,A,i knew her so slightly
p00759_A,00759,A,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz
p00760_A,00760,A,i should have thought you could it sounds common sense you can t eat your cake and have it even in the world of the spirit
p00761_A,00761,A,your unfairness is worse than my materialism
p00762_A,00762,A,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00763_A,00763,A,not very listen to mine at the conference it was settled
p00764_A,00764,A,they would say that
p00765_A,00765,A,don t bother miss quested has cleared out at last
p00766_A,00766,A,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00767_A,00767,A,as dismay and anxiety
p00768_A,00768,A,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00769_A,00769,A,as far as i do mind i travel light
p00770_A,00770,A,what enemies
p00771_A,00771,A,now what is the matter
p00772_A,00772,A,it simply doesn t affect me spies are as thick as mosquitoes but it s years before i shall meet the one that kills me you ve something else in your mind
p00773_A,00773,A,you have you re cross with me about something or other
p00774_A,00774,A,you little rotter well i m damned amusement indeed is it likely at such a time
p00775_A,00775,A,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00776_A,00776,A,you re not offended
p00777_A,00777,A,if you are this must be cleared up later on
p00778_A,00778,A,but the way i said it must be cleared up i was unintentionally rude unreserved regrets
p00779_A,00779,A,oh leave it alone like all gossip it s merely one of those half alive things that try to crowd out real life take no notice it ll vanish like poor old mrs moore s tombs
p00780_A,00780,A,we ll discuss m l at dinner
p00781_A,00781,A,bring das to me
p00782_A,00782,A,in other words probably never for i am going quite soon to england
p00783_A,00783,A,i am only going for a little time on official business my service is anxious to get me away from chandrapore for a bit it is obliged to value me highly but does not care for me the situation is somewhat humorous
p00784_A,00784,A,enough to see my friends
p00785_A,00785,A,willingly what subject
p00786_A,00786,A,let us talk about poetry you people are sadly circumstanced whatever are you to write about you cannot say for evermore we know it s faded yet you can t have patriotic poetry of the india my india type when it s nobody s india
p00787_A,00787,A,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00788_A,00788,A,i hoped you would be
p00789_A,00789,A,there is something in religion that may not be true but has not yet been sung
p00790_A,00790,A,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00791_A,00791,A,hindus are unable to sing
p00792_A,00792,A,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00793_A,00793,A,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00794_A,00794,A,an artistic and thoughtful little suburb of london
p00795_A,00795,A,when would you like the carriage
p00796_A,00796,A,but you haven t got your bicycle my carriage fetched you let it take you away
p00797_A,00797,A,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00798_A,00798,A,yes to my eternal confusion you know how fond i am of you
p00799_A,00799,A,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00800_A,00800,A,why have you not answered my letters is there a short cut down to our carriage we must give up our walk the weather s pestilential
p00801_A,00801,A,are you not coming down yourself how goes it aziz
p00802_A,00802,A,are you making anything out of your life here
p00803_A,00803,A,who is in charge of the guest house
p00804_A,00804,A,where is he then
p00805_A,00805,A,i wrote beforehand to the durbar and asked if a visit was convenient i was told it was and arranged my tour accordingly but the guest house servants appear to have no definite instructions we can t get any eggs also my wife wants to go out in the boat
p00806_A,00806,A,exactly and no oars
p00807_A,00807,A,all four
p00808_A,00808,A,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00809_A,00809,A,will there be any objection to english people watching the procession
p00810_A,00810,A,we had a very different reception both at mudkul and deora they were kindness itself at deora the maharajah and maharani wanted us to see everything
p00811_A,00811,A,jump in ralph
p00812_A,00812,A,who on earth is mr quested
p00813_A,00813,A,quested quested don t you know that my wife was mrs moore s daughter perhaps this explains your odd attitude
p00814_A,00814,A,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you
p00815_A,00815,A,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00816_A,00816,A,if you won t talk about the marabar to stella why won t you talk to ralph he is a wise boy really and same metaphor he rides a little behind her though with her
p00817_A,00817,A,no we won t think about it from her point of view mau has been a success it calmed her both of them suffer from restlessness she found something soothing some solution of her queer troubles here do you know anything about this krishna business
p00818_A,00818,A,gokul is the village where krishna was born well more or less born for there s the same hovering between it and another village as between bethlehem and nazareth what i want to discover is its spiritual side if it has one
p00819_A,00819,A,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00820_A,00820,A,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00821_A,00821,A,no further use for politeness
p00822_A,00822,A,away from us indians go to seed at once look at the king emperor high school look at you forgetting your medicine and going back to charms look at your poems

p00825_A,00825,A,oh your hindu friends will like that won t they
p00826_A,00826,A,it will indeed be arranged
p00827_A,00827,A,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00828_A,00828,A,of course of course you know me
p00829_A,00829,A,guess what i look like before you come out that will be a kind of game

p00832_A,00832,A,yes yes one minute
p00833_A,00833,A,no no one in my pocket here it is
p00834_A,00834,A,one minute again
p00835_A,00835,A,but i always thought that englishmen kept their rooms so tidy it seems that this is not so i need not be so ashamed everything ranged coldly on shelves was what i thought i say mr fielding is the stud going to go in
p00836_A,00836,A,what s that last sentence please will you teach me some new words and so improve my english let me put in your stud i see the shirt back s hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity
p00837_A,00837,A,we wear them to pass the police
p00838_A,00838,A,if i m biking in english dress starch collar hat with ditch they take no notice when i wear a fez they cry your lamp s out lord curzon did not consider this when he urged natives of india to retain their picturesque costumes hooray stud s gone in sometimes i shut my eyes and dream i have splendid clothes again and am riding into battle behind alamgir mr fielding must not india have been beautiful then with the mogul empire at its height and alamgir reigning at delhi upon the peacock throne
p00839_A,00839,A,meet me i know no ladies
p00840_A,00840,A,oh yes i remember an excessively aged lady but will you please repeat the name of her companion
p00841_A,00841,A,just as you wish
p00842_A,00842,A,is she a post impressionist
p00843_A,00843,A,i do not consider mrs moore my friend i only met her accidentally in my mosque a single meeting is too short to make a friend
p00844_A,00844,A,oho the deccani brahman
p00845_A,00845,A,i should think not do you know what deccani brahmans say that england conquered india from them from them mind and not from the moguls is not that like their cheek they have even bribed it to appear in text books for they are so subtle and immensely rich professor godbole must be quite unlike all other deccani brahmans from all i can hear say a most sincere chap
p00846_A,00846,A,slack hindus they have no idea of society i know them very well because of a doctor at the hospital such a slack unpunctual fellow it is as well you did not go to their house for it would give you a wrong idea of india nothing sanitary i think for my own part they grew ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send
p00847_A,00847,A,mangoes mangoes
p00848_A,00848,A,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00849_A,00849,A,enquire from dr panna lal
p00850_A,00850,A,here s your home here s the celebrated hospitality of the east look at the flies look at the chunam coming off the walls isn t it jolly now i suppose you want to be off having seen an oriental interior
p00851_A,00851,A,i can rest the whole day thanks to worthy dr lal major callendar s spy i suppose you know but this time it didn t work i am allowed to have a slight temperature
p00852_A,00852,A,open it
p00853_A,00853,A,she was my wife you are the first englishman she has ever come before now put her photograph away
p00854_A,00854,A,oh it s nothing she was not a highly educated woman or even beautiful but put it away you would have seen her so why should you not see her photograph
p00855_A,00855,A,why not i believe in the purdah but i should have told her you were my brother and she would have seen you hamidullah saw her and several others
p00856_A,00856,A,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife
p00857_A,00857,A,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00858_A,00858,A,put her away she is of no importance she is dead i showed her to you because i have nothing else to show you may look round the whole of my bungalow now and empty everything i have no other secrets my three children live away with their grandmamma and that is all
p00859_A,00859,A,hamidullah liked them in england here we never look at them oh no much too careful let s talk of something else
p00860_A,00860,A,why are you not married
p00861_A,00861,A,excuse the following question have you any illegitimate children
p00862_A,00862,A,then your name will entirely die out
p00863_A,00863,A,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00864_A,00864,A,caring has nothing to do with it
p00865_A,00865,A,why don t you marry miss quested
p00866_A,00866,A,prig prig kindly explain isn t that a bad word
p00867_A,00867,A,but prig mr fielding how s that
p00868_A,00868,A,i thought her so nice and sincere
p00869_A,00869,A,has she indeed i am so glad
p00870_A,00870,A,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00871_A,00871,A,yes you re out of it my poor chap no miss quested for mr fielding however she was not beautiful she has practically no breasts if you come to think of it for the city magistrate they shall be sufficient perhaps and he for her for you i shall arrange a lady with breasts like mangoes
p00872_A,00872,A,i will not really and besides your position makes it dangerous for you you can t be too careful in every way mr fielding whatever you say or do in this damned country there is always some envious fellow on the look out you may be surprised to know that there were at least three spies sitting here when you came to enquire i was really a good deal upset that you talked in that fashion about god they will certainly report it
p00873_A,00873,A,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00874_A,00874,A,but speaking out may get you into trouble
p00875_A,00875,A,there listen to that but the end of it might be that you lost your job
p00876_A,00876,A,travel light you are a most extraordinary race is it your climate or what
p00877_A,00877,A,i know i gave him orders not to such are the tricks we play on unfortunate englishmen poor mr fielding but i will release you now oh dear with the exception of yourself and hamidullah i have no one to talk to in this place you like hamidullah don t you
p00878_A,00878,A,do you promise to come at once to us when you are in trouble
p00879_A,00879,A,jump on i must have you
p00880_A,00880,A,oh she s all right she went down to see miss derek well here s luck chin chin
p00881_A,00881,A,here s luck and here s to england oh yes that s quite likely i knew they d gone for a spin
p00882_A,00882,A,oh no why
p00883_A,00883,A,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00884_A,00884,A,up there

p00890_A,00890,A,i see you re worrying let s talk of other things miss quested was always to do what she wished it was our arrangement i see you are worrying on my account but really i don t mind i never notice trifles
p00891_A,00891,A,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00892_A,00892,A,he is plenty of good for himself his dishonesty will ruin me
p00893_A,00893,A,i am delighted with him really he has made my guests comfortable besides it is my duty to employ him he is my cousin if money goes money comes if money stays death comes did you ever hear that useful urdu proverb probably not for i have just invented it
p00894_A,00894,A,oh kick you out why should i trouble over that dirty job leave it to the politicians no when i was a student i got excited over your damned countrymen certainly but if they ll let me get on with my profession and not be too rude to me officially i really don t ask for more
p00895_A,00895,A,my children and my name
p00896_A,00896,A,cyril cyril don t leave me

p00898_A,00898,A,good night then dear fellow are you content with our day s work cyril
p00899_A,00899,A,except that i ate too much i say panna lal and callendar ll get the sack
p00900_A,00900,A,and you ll get promotion
p00901_A,00901,A,in any case we spend our holidays together and visit kashmir possibly persia for i shall have plenty of money paid to me on account of the injury sustained by my character while with me you shall never spend a single pie this is what i have always wished and as the result of my misfortunes it has come
p00902_A,00902,A,i know my dear chap i know your voice need not become so solemn and anxious i know what you are going to say next let oh let miss quested off paying so that the english may say the approval of your compatriots no longer interests me i have become anti british and ought to have done so sooner it would have saved me numerous misfortunes
p00903_A,00903,A,i say shall we go and pour water on to mohammed latif s face he is so funny when this is done to him asleep
p00904_A,00904,A,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00905_A,00905,A,i am looking though it gets a bit dark i see cyril fielding to be a very nice chap indeed and my best friend but in some ways a fool you think that by letting miss quested off easily i shall make a better reputation for myself and indians generally no no it will be put down to weakness and the attempt to gain promotion officially i have decided to have nothing more to do with british india as a matter of fact i shall seek service in some moslem state such as hyderabad bhopal where englishmen cannot insult me any more don t counsel me otherwise
p00906_A,00906,A,i don t want to hear your long talks
p00907_A,00907,A,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology
p00908_A,00908,A,will she sign that
p00909_A,00909,A,good night i suppose it is
p00910_A,00910,A,i put up with all things in you so what is to be done
p00911_A,00911,A,cyril i have had an idea which will satisfy your tender mind i shall consult mrs moore her opinion will solve everything i can trust her so absolutely if she advises me to pardon this girl i shall do so she will counsel me nothing against my real and true honour as you might
p00912_A,00912,A,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00913_A,00913,A,to those other children
p00914_A,00914,A,just as i have two boys and a girl so has mrs moore she told me in the mosque
p00915_A,00915,A,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00916_A,00916,A,is emotion a sack of potatoes so much the pound to be measured out am i a machine i shall be told i can use up my emotions by using them next
p00917_A,00917,A,if you are right there is no point in any friendship it all comes down to give and take or give and return which is disgusting and we had better all leap over this parapet and kill ourselves is anything wrong with you this evening that you grow so materialistic
p00918_A,00918,A,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00919_A,00919,A,i do not believe him
p00920_A,00920,A,give in to the east you can trust me cyril can t you see that i m grateful to you for your help and want to reward you
p00921_A,00921,A,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00922_A,00922,A,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00923_A,00923,A,it s all over the town and may injure your reputation you know everyone is by no means your supporter i have tried all i could to silence such a story
p00924_A,00924,A,it is those who stop in the country not those who leave it whom such a story injures imagine my dismay and anxiety i could scarcely get a wink of sleep first my name was coupled with her and now it is yours
p00925_A,00925,A,as what
p00926_A,00926,A,have i not lived all my life in india do i not know what produces a bad impression here
p00927_A,00927,A,you mind for miss quested s sake though i can see from your face
p00928_A,00928,A,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00929_A,00929,A,i have given you list after list of the people who cannot be trusted in this city in your position i should have the sense to know i was surrounded by enemies you observe i speak in a low voice it is because i see your sais is new how do i know he isn t a spy every third servant is a spy
p00930_A,00930,A,do you contradict my last remark
p00931_A,00931,A,i ve not don t be ridiculous
p00932_A,00932,A,so you and madamsell adela used to amuse one another in the evening naughty boy
p00933_A,00933,A,oh i beg your pardon i m sure the licentious oriental imagination was at work
p00934_A,00934,A,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00935_A,00935,A,most certainly i am not
p00936_A,00936,A,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00937_A,00937,A,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this
p00938_A,00938,A,mohammed latif has taken to intriguing we are already much displeased with him will it satisfy you if we send him back to his family without a present
p00939_A,00939,A,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das
p00940_A,00940,A,he will have invited other friends

p00942_A,00942,A,what is the nature of the business will it leave you much spare time
p00943_A,00943,A,i expected you to make such a reply you are a faithful friend shall we now talk about something else
p00944_A,00944,A,poetry let us discuss why poetry has lost the power of making men brave my mother s father was also a poet and fought against you in the mutiny i might equal him if there was another mutiny as it is i am a doctor who has won a case and has three children to support and whose chief subject of conversation is official plans
p00945_A,00945,A,i like this conversation it may lead to something interesting
p00946_A,00946,A,i was a child when you knew me first everyone was my friend then the friend a persian expression for god but i do not want to be a religious poet either
p00947_A,00947,A,why when you yourself are an atheist

p00974_A,00974,A,as i fell into our largest mau tank under circumstances our other friends will relate i thought how brave miss quested was and decided to tell her so despite my imperfect english through you i am happy here with my children instead of in a prison of that i make no doubt my children shall be taught to speak of you with the greatest affection and respect
p00975_A,00975,A,i want to do kind actions all round and wipe out the wretched business of the marabar for ever i have been so disgracefully hasty thinking you meant to get hold of my money as bad a mistake as the cave itself
p00976_A,00976,A,how so

p00979_A,00979,A,my dear chap officially they call it gokul ashtami all the state offices are closed but how else should it concern you and me
p00980_A,00980,A,it is useless discussing hindus with me living with them teaches me no more when i think i annoy them i do not when i think i don t annoy them i do perhaps they will sack me for tumbling on to their dolls house on the other hand perhaps they will double my salary time will prove why so curious about them

p01014_A,01014,A,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean
p01015_A,01015,A,oh my happiness that s quite another problem i want to consult you about this anglo indian difficulty can you give me any advice
p01016_A,01016,A,i am told we all get rude after a year
p01017_A,01017,A,no i m all right thanks are you married dr aziz
p01018_A,01018,A,thank you

p01021_A,01021,A,have you one wife or more than one
p01022_A,01022,A,oh please do not mention a little thing like that is there anything else i may tell you about my country
p01023_A,01023,A,then back with water streaming over you and perhaps rather a pain inside but i did not mind all my friends were paining with me we have a proverb in urdu what does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy together which comes in conveniently after mangoes miss quested do wait for mangoes why not settle altogether in india
p01024_A,01024,A,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01025_A,01025,A,yes all that is settled i invite you all to see me in the marabar caves
p01026_A,01026,A,i know
p01027_A,01027,A,good bye mrs moore
p01028_A,01028,A,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p01029_A,01029,A,what a shame you leave india so soon oh do reconsider your decision do stay
p01030_A,01030,A,send back your servant he is unnecessary then we shall all be moslems together
p01031_A,01031,A,i am to blame i am the host
p01032_A,01032,A,mohammed latif by the way what is in these caves brother why are we all going to see them
p01033_A,01033,A,good morning good morning put on your topis put on your topis at once the early sun is highly dangerous for heads i speak as a doctor
p01034_A,01034,A,not for my thick head
p01035_A,01035,A,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01036_A,01036,A,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01037_A,01037,A,this breakfast did you think i should treat you so strangely
p01038_A,01038,A,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p01039_A,01039,A,ralph and stella yes i know everything about them but we must not forget to visit our caves one of the dreams of my life is accomplished in having you both here as my guests you cannot imagine how you have honoured me i feel like the emperor babur
p01040_A,01040,A,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01041_A,01041,A,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start
p01042_A,01042,A,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01043_A,01043,A,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p01044_A,01044,A,miss quested fine but foolish you keep your religion i mine that is the best nothing embraces the whole of india nothing nothing and that was akbar s mistake
p01045_A,01045,A,on which my heartiest congratulations
p01046_A,01046,A,impossible take back such a terrible remark
p01047_A,01047,A,you are certain to be happy with any relative of mrs moore s
p01048_A,01048,A,you are absolutely unlike the others i assure you you will never be rude to my people
p01049_A,01049,A,then you are told a lie come along
p01050_A,01050,A,pretty sure they should come on some interesting old carvings soon

p01052_A,01052,A,yes indeed do come and see my wife
p01053_A,01053,A,she is not in chandrapore just now
p01054_A,01054,A,yes indeed three
p01055_A,01055,A,why naturally i adore them i suppose so
p01056_A,01056,A,an indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us this morning at nine it has never come we waited and waited and waited we can t think what happened
p01057_A,01057,A,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p01058_A,01058,A,oh do you think so mr fielding
p01059_A,01059,A,good bye mr fielding and thank you so much what lovely college buildings

p01062_A,01062,A,mr fielding have you seen miss quested
p01063_A,01063,A,miss derek is most unsatisfactory and restless always in a hurry always wanting something new she will do anything in the world except go back to the indian lady who pays her
p01064_A,01064,A,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01065_A,01065,A,i know
p01066_A,01066,A,a mystery is a muddle
p01067_A,01067,A,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01068_A,01068,A,good bye miss quested

p01077_A,01077,A,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01078_A,01078,A,still they are ornamented in some way
p01079_A,01079,A,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01080_A,01080,A,describe them to this lady then

p01082_A,01082,A,did he since when

p01085_A,01085,A,but i will send you up a few healthy sweets i will give myself that pleasure
p01086_A,01086,A,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01087_A,01087,A,oh no oh no
p01088_A,01088,A,oh no
p01089_A,01089,A,no i should not quite say that
p01090_A,01090,A,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01091_A,01091,A,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly

p01094_A,01094,A,then tell me everything you will or i shall never understand india are they the hills i sometimes see in the evening what are these caves
p01095_A,01095,A,are they large caves
p01096_A,01096,A,do describe them professor godbole
p01097_A,01097,A,something like the caves at elephanta
p01098_A,01098,A,good bye professor godbole it s a shame we never heard you sing
p01099_A,01099,A,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01100_A,01100,A,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01101_A,01101,A,no not large
p01102_A,01102,A,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01103_A,01103,A,not heard of them the marabar caves in the marabar hills
p01104_A,01104,A,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p01105_A,01105,A,come along up and join us mr heaslop sit down till your mother turns up he may not understand that allow me
p01106_A,01106,A,i m sorry what s up
p01107_A,01107,A,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p01108_A,01108,A,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01109_A,01109,A,i may sing now
p01110_A,01110,A,may i now take my leave now i take my leave i must tell you how glad i am to hear that after all you succeeded in reaching the marabar i feared my unpunctuality had prevented you but you went a far pleasanter method in miss derek s car i hope the expedition was a successful one
p01111_A,01111,A,oh yes
p01112_A,01112,A,oh yes that is all round the college
p01113_A,01113,A,i cannot say i was not present
p01114_A,01114,A,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01115_A,01115,A,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01116_A,01116,A,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01117_A,01117,A,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01118_A,01118,A,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01119_A,01119,A,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01120_A,01120,A,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01121_A,01121,A,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01122_A,01122,A,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01123_A,01123,A,thanks so much what was that
p01124_A,01124,A,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01125_A,01125,A,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01126_A,01126,A,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01127_A,01127,A,i am most frightfully cut up
p01128_A,01128,A,yes alas
p01129_A,01129,A,a name a name for a school
p01130_A,01130,A,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01131_A,01131,A,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01132_A,01132,A,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01133_A,01133,A,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01134_A,01134,A,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01135_A,01135,A,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01136_A,01136,A,yes yes
p01137_A,01137,A,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01138_A,01138,A,but he comes in some other song i hope
p01139_A,01139,A,oh no he refuses to come i say to him come come come come come come he neglects to come
p01140_A,01140,A,what do i hear what most improbable statement have i heard an english lady useless no no no no no
p01141_A,01141,A,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p01142_A,01142,A,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p01143_A,01143,A,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p01144_A,01144,A,all over oh yes the danger is past let us smoke cigarettes let us do anything we please oh yes enjoy ourselves oh my merciful god
p01145_A,01145,A,exactly too big for a goat
p01146_A,01146,A,sahib says hyena
p01147_A,01147,A,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01148_A,01148,A,ah now i begin to understand
p01149_A,01149,A,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p01150_A,01150,A,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p01151_A,01151,A,he may show you some aspect of the country i can t and he s a real loyalist i thought you might care for a bit of a change
p01152_A,01152,A,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p01153_A,01153,A,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p01154_A,01154,A,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p01155_A,01155,A,my fault that i told him to come this way because the road s better mr lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills

p01224_A,01224,A,aziz aziz my dear boy we must be going we are already late get well quickly for i do not know what our little circle would do without you
p01225_A,01225,A,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01226_A,01226,A,add mine to them
p01227_A,01227,A,gentlemen you will excuse i have come to enquire by major callendar s orders
p01228_A,01228,A,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01229_A,01229,A,it is only my duty
p01230_A,01230,A,yes that is true
p01231_A,01231,A,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01232_A,01232,A,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively
p01233_A,01233,A,here he lies
p01234_A,01234,A,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01235_A,01235,A,we know how busy you are
p01236_A,01236,A,and how much illness there is in the city
p01237_A,01237,A,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01238_A,01238,A,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01239_A,01239,A,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01240_A,01240,A,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01241_A,01241,A,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01242_A,01242,A,it is only a boy
p01243_A,01243,A,i think not much
p01244_A,01244,A,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01245_A,01245,A,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01246_A,01246,A,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01247_A,01247,A,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01248_A,01248,A,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01249_A,01249,A,even boys must learn
p01250_A,01250,A,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01251_A,01251,A,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01252_A,01252,A,forgive my mistakes
p01253_A,01253,A,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01254_A,01254,A,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p01255_A,01255,A,oh that is true how true
p01256_A,01256,A,does mr fielding think it s true
p01257_A,01257,A,no no the existence of providence
p01258_A,01258,A,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01259_A,01259,A,and does not morality also decline
p01260_A,01260,A,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01261_A,01261,A,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01262_A,01262,A,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01263_A,01263,A,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01264_A,01264,A,ah ah has some evidence come
p01265_A,01265,A,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01266_A,01266,A,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01267_A,01267,A,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01268_A,01268,A,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01269_A,01269,A,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01270_A,01270,A,hullo my dear fielding so i run you down at last can you come out at once to dilkusha
p01271_A,01271,A,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01272_A,01272,A,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01273_A,01273,A,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01274_A,01274,A,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01275_A,01275,A,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01276_A,01276,A,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01277_A,01277,A,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01278_A,01278,A,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01279_A,01279,A,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01280_A,01280,A,may is no month to allow an old lady to travel in
p01281_A,01281,A,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01282_A,01282,A,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01283_A,01283,A,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01284_A,01284,A,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01285_A,01285,A,i don t believe in god
p01286_A,01286,A,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01287_A,01287,A,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01288_A,01288,A,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01289_A,01289,A,i guess they do i got in first
p01290_A,01290,A,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01291_A,01291,A,none chuck em out
p01292_A,01292,A,it s all a mistake
p01293_A,01293,A,it will come
p01294_A,01294,A,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01295_A,01295,A,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01296_A,01296,A,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01297_A,01297,A,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01298_A,01298,A,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p01299_A,01299,A,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01300_A,01300,A,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01301_A,01301,A,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01302_A,01302,A,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01303_A,01303,A,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01304_A,01304,A,i ll see him first if you prefer
p01305_A,01305,A,thank goodness that s over
p01306_A,01306,A,he couldn t very well after my behaviour to him at the club heaslop doesn t come out badly besides fate has treated him pretty roughly to day he has had a cable to the effect that his mother s dead poor old soul
p01307_A,01307,A,she died at sea
p01308_A,01308,A,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01309_A,01309,A,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01310_A,01310,A,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01311_A,01311,A,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p01312_A,01312,A,well i don t believe in providence
p01313_A,01313,A,but how then can you believe in god
p01314_A,01314,A,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01315_A,01315,A,oh that is true how true
p01316_A,01316,A,i beg pardon but some might say your leg kicks
p01317_A,01317,A,aziz has a high opinion of you he only did not speak because of his illness
p01318_A,01318,A,bad bad you have destroyed me
p01319_A,01319,A,hurry up sir we pull you in a procession
p01320_A,01320,A,and he is such a horrible servant antony you can go we don t want you
p01321_A,01321,A,mistress tells you to go
p01322_A,01322,A,master told me to come
p01323_A,01323,A,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01324_A,01324,A,mohammed latif here is my cousin mr mohammed latif oh no don t shake hands he is an indian of the old fashioned sort he prefers to salaam there i told you so mohammed latif how beautifully you salaam see he hasn t understood he knows no english
p01325_A,01325,A,tell me another time brother when i have more leisure for now as i have already explained we have to give pleasure to non moslems three will be europeans one a hindu which must not be forgotten every attention must be paid to professor godbole lest he feel that he is inferior to my other guests
p01326_A,01326,A,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01327_A,01327,A,you spick lie
p01328_A,01328,A,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01329_A,01329,A,merciful god
p01330_A,01330,A,oh what a surprise
p01331_A,01331,A,why haven t you gone to the marabar
p01332_A,01332,A,dr aziz it is my highly painful duty to arrest you
p01333_A,01333,A,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01334_A,01334,A,i am under instructions not to say
p01335_A,01335,A,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde
p01336_A,01336,A,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01337_A,01337,A,hullo some mistake
p01338_A,01338,A,on what charge do you arrest him
p01339_A,01339,A,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01340_A,01340,A,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01341_A,01341,A,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p01342_A,01342,A,the worst thing in my whole career has happened miss quested has been insulted in one of the marabar caves
p01343_A,01343,A,she escaped by god s grace
p01344_A,01344,A,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01345_A,01345,A,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01346_A,01346,A,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01347_A,01347,A,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01348_A,01348,A,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01349_A,01349,A,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01350_A,01350,A,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01351_A,01351,A,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01352_A,01352,A,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01353_A,01353,A,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01354_A,01354,A,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01355_A,01355,A,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01356_A,01356,A,oh no oh no no
p01357_A,01357,A,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01358_A,01358,A,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01359_A,01359,A,then she s mad
p01360_A,01360,A,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01361_A,01361,A,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01362_A,01362,A,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01363_A,01363,A,i shall certainly come sir and i am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over me may i venture to ask where miss quested is
p01364_A,01364,A,i believe dr aziz to be innocent
p01365_A,01365,A,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01366_A,01366,A,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01367_A,01367,A,i have accepted re election sir do you regard it as necessary i should come i should be glad to be excused indeed i have a dinner engagement this evening
p01368_A,01368,A,what is the charge precisely
p01369_A,01369,A,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01370_A,01370,A,did she say any more
p01371_A,01371,A,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01372_A,01372,A,was a guide not with her
p01373_A,01373,A,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01374_A,01374,A,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01375_A,01375,A,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01376_A,01376,A,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01377_A,01377,A,i don t follow
p01378_A,01378,A,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01379_A,01379,A,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01380_A,01380,A,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01381_A,01381,A,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01382_A,01382,A,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01383_A,01383,A,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01384_A,01384,A,i know but she tells it to you
p01385_A,01385,A,i wish you wouldn t
p01386_A,01386,A,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01387_A,01387,A,well when he s done with them
p01388_A,01388,A,i say he s innocent
p01389_A,01389,A,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01390_A,01390,A,so i have just told you
p01391_A,01391,A,i see what you mean
p01392_A,01392,A,can i visit aziz
p01393_A,01393,A,to whom do i apply for an order
p01394_A,01394,A,that sounds comfortable
p01395_A,01395,A,that s his wife
p01396_A,01396,A,he told me
p01397_A,01397,A,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01398_A,01398,A,have a look at them
p01399_A,01399,A,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01400_A,01400,A,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01401_A,01401,A,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01402_A,01402,A,i hardly think that would do surely
p01403_A,01403,A,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01404_A,01404,A,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01405_A,01405,A,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01406_A,01406,A,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01407_A,01407,A,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01408_A,01408,A,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01409_A,01409,A,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01410_A,01410,A,possibly my wife might ask her that much

p01419_A,01419,A,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01420_A,01420,A,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01421_A,01421,A,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01422_A,01422,A,city magistrate

p01435_A,01435,A,mrs blakiston was saying if only there were a few tommies
p01436_A,01436,A,right you are burra sahib angels exactly

p01439_A,01439,A,stand up you swine
p01440_A,01440,A,no one s out of danger in this country as long as they have a temperature
p01441_A,01441,A,take me some time to do that
p01442_A,01442,A,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01443_A,01443,A,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01444_A,01444,A,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01445_A,01445,A,squat down callendar tell us all about it

p01448_A,01448,A,why should it
p01449_A,01449,A,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01450_A,01450,A,i wish to god i hadn t given my jewel of an assistant leave i ld cut my tongue out first to feel i m responsible that s what hits me to refuse and then give in under pressure that is what i did my sons that is what i did i understood an englishman was to accompany the expedition that is why i gave in
p01451_A,01451,A,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01452_A,01452,A,we shall do we shall do
p01453_A,01453,A,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01454_A,01454,A,no what about him
p01455_A,01455,A,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01456_A,01456,A,do come quietly mary
p01457_A,01457,A,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01458_A,01458,A,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01459_A,01459,A,then what do you mean
p01460_A,01460,A,that s ridiculous
p01461_A,01461,A,does anyone here present want to
p01462_A,01462,A,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01463_A,01463,A,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01464_A,01464,A,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01465_A,01465,A,how is your mother old boy
p01466_A,01466,A,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01467_A,01467,A,i do i do i m satisfied
p01468_A,01468,A,not one of them s all right
p01469_A,01469,A,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01470_A,01470,A,my old das is all right
p01471_A,01471,A,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01472_A,01472,A,hear hear
p01473_A,01473,A,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p01474_A,01474,A,he s a crank a crank
p01475_A,01475,A,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01476_A,01476,A,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01477_A,01477,A,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01478_A,01478,A,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01479_A,01479,A,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01480_A,01480,A,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01481_A,01481,A,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01482_A,01482,A,you went alone into one of those caves
p01483_A,01483,A,the prisoner followed you didn t he
p01484_A,01484,A,i beg your pardon
p01485_A,01485,A,what is that what are you saying speak up please
p01486_A,01486,A,what nature of mistake
p01487_A,01487,A,i must come before someone
p01488_A,01488,A,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01489_A,01489,A,why should he write to me
p01490_A,01490,A,is it
p01491_A,01491,A,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01492_A,01492,A,i know where you mean
p01493_A,01493,A,that is quite correct
p01494_A,01494,A,i am not i am not quite sure
p01495_A,01495,A,i cannot be sure
p01496_A,01496,A,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01497_A,01497,A,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01498_A,01498,A,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01499_A,01499,A,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01500_A,01500,A,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p01501_A,01501,A,all right i said don t apologize
p01502_A,01502,A,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01503_A,01503,A,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01504_A,01504,A,at last some sense is being talked
p01505_A,01505,A,that s better
p01506_A,01506,A,even when the lady is so uglier than the gentleman
p01507_A,01507,A,turn that man out
p01508_A,01508,A,i must have better arrangements than this made for my patient why isn t she given a seat on the platform she gets no air
p01509_A,01509,A,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01510_A,01510,A,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01511_A,01511,A,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01512_A,01512,A,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01513_A,01513,A,are you all right yourselves
p01514_A,01514,A,and the prisoner followed you
p01515_A,01515,A,excuse me we object to the presence of so many european ladies and gentlemen upon the platform they will have the effect of intimidating our witnesses their place is with the rest of the public in the body of the hall we have no objection to miss quested remaining on the platform since she has been unwell we shall extend every courtesy to her throughout despite the scientific truths revealed to us by the district superintendent of police but we do object to the others
p01516_A,01516,A,i agree to that it was only to miss quested that i gave permission to sit up here her friends should be so excessively kind as to climb down
p01517_A,01517,A,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01518_A,01518,A,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01519_A,01519,A,i should object a platform confers authority
p01520_A,01520,A,thank you very much sir thank you mr heaslop thank you ladies all
p01521_A,01521,A,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01522_A,01522,A,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01523_A,01523,A,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01524_A,01524,A,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01525_A,01525,A,not buddhist i think jain
p01526_A,01526,A,all the marabar caves are jain
p01527_A,01527,A,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01528_A,01528,A,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01529_A,01529,A,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01530_A,01530,A,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01531_A,01531,A,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01532_A,01532,A,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01533_A,01533,A,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01534_A,01534,A,this is no way to defend your case
p01535_A,01535,A,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01536_A,01536,A,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01537_A,01537,A,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01538_A,01538,A,i apologize for my colleague he is an intimate friend of our client and his feelings have carried him away
p01539_A,01539,A,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01540_A,01540,A,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01541_A,01541,A,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01542_A,01542,A,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01543_A,01543,A,are you mad
p01544_A,01544,A,right i withdraw
p01545_A,01545,A,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01546_A,01546,A,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01547_A,01547,A,dr aziz never
p01548_A,01548,A,i withdraw everything
p01549_A,01549,A,give me time to consider
p01550_A,01550,A,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01551_A,01551,A,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01552_A,01552,A,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01553_A,01553,A,sir i intend these for you sir
p01554_A,01554,A,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01555_A,01555,A,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01556_A,01556,A,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p01557_A,01557,A,oh my god
p01558_A,01558,A,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01559_A,01559,A,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01560_A,01560,A,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01561_A,01561,A,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01562_A,01562,A,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01563_A,01563,A,ah you were boasting she had reached aden in court
p01564_A,01564,A,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01565_A,01565,A,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p01566_A,01566,A,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01567_A,01567,A,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p01568_A,01568,A,at last
p01569_A,01569,A,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01570_A,01570,A,does he tell me to come out to him
p01571_A,01571,A,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01572_A,01572,A,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p01573_A,01573,A,twenty thousand rupees
p01574_A,01574,A,to what duties miss quested are you returning in your own country after your taste of the tropics observe i don t say to what do you turn but to what do you re turn every life ought to contain both a turn and a re turn this celebrated pioneer will make my question clear he turns to the east he re turns to the west you can see it from the cute position of his hands one of which holds a string of sausages
p01575_A,01575,A,my dear das why when you tried to send me to prison should i try to send mr bhattacharya a poem eh that is naturally entirely a joke i will write him the best i can but i thought your magazine was for hindus
p01576_A,01576,A,there is no such person in existence as the general indian
p01577_A,01577,A,i know but will it last
p01578_A,01578,A,half a sec here you are is not this better than a poem
p01579_A,01579,A,you are full of compliments to day
p01580_A,01580,A,oh well about this poem how did you hear i sometimes scribbled
p01581_A,01581,A,how did he hear
p01582_A,01582,A,it is not for hindus but indians generally
p01583_A,01583,A,there was not but there may be when you have written a poem you are our hero the whole city is behind you irrespective of creed
p01584_A,01584,A,i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul
p01585_A,01585,A,happy the man who can compose both
p01586_A,01586,A,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p01587_A,01587,A,excuse my mistakes realize my limitations life is not easy as we know it on the earth
p01588_A,01588,A,professor godbole often mentioned it before his departure for mau
p01589_A,01589,A,he too was a poet do you not divine each other
p01590_A,01590,A,i name this child shri krishna
p01591_A,01591,A,throw stones

p01618_A,01618,A,excellent news
p01619_A,01619,A,i have brought you some salve but how to put it on in your present nervous state becomes a problem

p01628_A,01628,A,what what do you mean
p01629_A,01629,A,but there s no rajah nothing
p01630_A,01630,A,i can t tell you what that is i m sure his highness is dead i think we should go back at once shall we go back now
p01631_A,01631,A,i d rather not go nearer they have such strange customs and might hurt you
p01632_A,01632,A,the signora had no business to do it no business at all she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart oh lucy
p01633_A,01633,A,this meat has surely been used for soup
p01634_A,01634,A,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p01635_A,01635,A,you must have it
p01636_A,01636,A,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p01637_A,01637,A,because it is quite out of the question thank you
p01638_A,01638,A,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p01639_A,01639,A,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p01640_A,01640,A,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p01641_A,01641,A,was i a bore why didn t you talk lucy he prefers young people i m sure i do hope i haven t monopolized him i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinner time
p01642_A,01642,A,my dear lucia
p01643_A,01643,A,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p01644_A,01644,A,i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion
p01645_A,01645,A,undoubtedly he was
p01646_A,01646,A,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p01647_A,01647,A,poor young man
p01648_A,01648,A,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p01649_A,01649,A,naturally dear it is my affair
p01650_A,01650,A,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p01651_A,01651,A,because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too
p01652_A,01652,A,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p01653_A,01653,A,what do you think about it
p01654_A,01654,A,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p01655_A,01655,A,and the news
p01656_A,01656,A,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p01657_A,01657,A,i die for it
p01658_A,01658,A,oh lucy you ought to be with mr eager i m sure
p01659_A,01659,A,mr eager will be offended it is your party
p01660_A,01660,A,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p01661_A,01661,A,do not cry dearest take your time
p01662_A,01662,A,i trust not one would always pray against that
p01663_A,01663,A,in a book
p01664_A,01664,A,and then
p01665_A,01665,A,don t be troubled dearest wait till you are calmer we will talk it over before bed time in my room
p01666_A,01666,A,well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair so what is to be done what is to be done a point dearest which you alone can settle
p01667_A,01667,A,how do you propose to silence him
p01668_A,01668,A,my dear girl no mr george emerson
p01669_A,01669,A,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p01670_A,01670,A,my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first come here and listen to me i am only gathering it from his own remarks do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another well i am no prude there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish but we are no farther on with our question what do you propose to do
p01671_A,01671,A,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p01672_A,01672,A,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p01673_A,01673,A,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p01674_A,01674,A,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p01675_A,01675,A,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done
p01676_A,01676,A,come away from the window dear you will be seen from the road oh for a real man we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless there is mr eager but you do not trust him oh for your brother he is young but i know that his sister s insult would rouse in him a very lion thank god chivalry is not yet dead there are still left some men who can reverence woman it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try
p01677_A,01677,A,the train to rome
p01678_A,01678,A,at eight
p01679_A,01679,A,we must face that
p01680_A,01680,A,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p01681_A,01681,A,dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me
p01682_A,01682,A,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p01683_A,01683,A,my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary you had your own way about these rooms at all events
p01684_A,01684,A,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p01685_A,01685,A,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p01686_A,01686,A,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p01687_A,01687,A,but you tell her everything
p01688_A,01688,A,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p01689_A,01689,A,but who am i to give the sovereign to
p01690_A,01690,A,i had forgotten the driver thank you dear for reminding me a shilling was it can any one give me change for half a crown
p01691_A,01691,A,have you told him about him yet
p01692_A,01692,A,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p01693_A,01693,A,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p01694_A,01694,A,we must think of every possibility
p01695_A,01695,A,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p01696_A,01696,A,to contradict it
p01697_A,01697,A,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p01698_A,01698,A,i am no match for you in conversation dearest i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am you will never forgive me
p01699_A,01699,A,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p01700_A,01700,A,what happened

p01712_A,01712,A,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p01713_A,01713,A,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p01714_A,01714,A,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle

p01781_A,01781,A,oh it s all right
p01782_A,01782,A,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it

p01789_A,01789,A,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p01790_A,01790,A,oh i had no idea
p01791_A,01791,A,do you know about it please they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance
p01792_A,01792,A,there are violets i cannot believe it is a coincidence charlotte charlotte how could you have told her i have thought before speaking it must be you
p01793_A,01793,A,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p01794_A,01794,A,not so that one could recognize it yes
p01795_A,01795,A,so you did tell
p01796_A,01796,A,but charlotte what about the promise you gave me when we were packing why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldn t even let me tell mother
p01797_A,01797,A,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p01798_A,01798,A,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p01799_A,01799,A,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p01800_A,01800,A,i want something more definite will you speak to him it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word

p01829_A,01829,A,i don t know i don t understand this sort of thing i was not meant to understand it
p01830_A,01830,A,oh how terrible
p01831_A,01831,A,i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair i am deeply sorry about it
p01832_A,01832,A,mr emerson don t leave at least not on my account i am going to greece don t leave your comfortable house
p01833_A,01833,A,yes but you won t go back to london it s absurd
p01834_A,01834,A,oh mr emerson you mustn t i ve been bother enough to the world by now i can t have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through it all on my account you must stop i am just going to greece
p01835_A,01835,A,so you must stop you won t talk about this business i know i can trust you both
p01836_A,01836,A,i shouldn t want
p01837_A,01837,A,no please sit still i think i will sit in the carriage
p01838_A,01838,A,not a bit
p01839_A,01839,A,not till january it wasn t
p01840_A,01840,A,he is not going i made a slip mr vyse does stop behind in england
p01841_A,01841,A,i i had to
p01842_A,01842,A,how dare you oh how like a man i mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man
p01843_A,01843,A,no they are in the hall oh please not mr emerson they trust me
p01844_A,01844,A,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p01845_A,01845,A,why shouldn t you
p01846_A,01846,A,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p01847_A,01847,A,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p01848_A,01848,A,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p01849_A,01849,A,george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate
p01850_A,01850,A,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p01851_A,01851,A,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p01852_A,01852,A,yes indeed
p01853_A,01853,A,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p01854_A,01854,A,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p01855_A,01855,A,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p01856_A,01856,A,yes i heard from mother so last week she didn t know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr beebe is
p01857_A,01857,A,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p01858_A,01858,A,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p01859_A,01859,A,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p01860_A,01860,A,oh what a funny thing some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet
p01861_A,01861,A,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p01862_A,01862,A,poor charlotte will be sopped
p01863_A,01863,A,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p01864_A,01864,A,what is it about
p01865_A,01865,A,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p01866_A,01866,A,whatever happened
p01867_A,01867,A,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p01868_A,01868,A,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p01869_A,01869,A,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p01870_A,01870,A,oh it has been such a nuisance first he then they no one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome
p01871_A,01871,A,but cecil s emersons they can t possibly be the same ones there is that
p01872_A,01872,A,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p01873_A,01873,A,i don t think i will thank you
p01874_A,01874,A,oh he did
p01875_A,01875,A,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p01876_A,01876,A,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p01877_A,01877,A,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p01878_A,01878,A,and freddy minds
p01879_A,01879,A,boys are so odd
p01880_A,01880,A,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p01881_A,01881,A,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p01882_A,01882,A,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p01883_A,01883,A,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p01884_A,01884,A,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p01885_A,01885,A,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p01886_A,01886,A,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p01887_A,01887,A,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p01888_A,01888,A,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p01889_A,01889,A,i must get away ever so far i must know my own mind and where i want to go
p01890_A,01890,A,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p01891_A,01891,A,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p01892_A,01892,A,i think so i ll see
p01893_A,01893,A,very well thank you
p01894_A,01894,A,i i did
p01895_A,01895,A,i shall never marry him
p01896_A,01896,A,mr beebe i have misled you i have misled myself
p01897_A,01897,A,mr beebe could you help me
p01898_A,01898,A,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p01899_A,01899,A,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p01900_A,01900,A,miss bartlett it s all right about the rooms i m so glad mr emerson was talking about it in the smoking room and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again he has let me come and ask you he would be so pleased
p01901_A,01901,A,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p01902_A,01902,A,what about music
p01903_A,01903,A,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p01904_A,01904,A,they do say so
p01905_A,01905,A,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p01906_A,01906,A,let me finish the story miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said she went at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience
p01907_A,01907,A,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p01908_A,01908,A,a nice fellow he will work off his crudities in time i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully
p01909_A,01909,A,how do you do miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive would you come too
p01910_A,01910,A,i met them on the hill your brother told me
p01911_A,01911,A,i needn t say that it will go no further
p01912_A,01912,A,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p01913_A,01913,A,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p01914_A,01914,A,i am very sorry for that
p01915_A,01915,A,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p01916_A,01916,A,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p01917_A,01917,A,next week i gather
p01918_A,01918,A,no he didn t
p01919_A,01919,A,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p01920_A,01920,A,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p01921_A,01921,A,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p01922_A,01922,A,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p01923_A,01923,A,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p01924_A,01924,A,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p01925_A,01925,A,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p01926_A,01926,A,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p01927_A,01927,A,that s all right i counted on you two keeping each other company it s pouring again the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it did powell go round
p01928_A,01928,A,no of course i ll see how are the miss alans
p01929_A,01929,A,did you tell mr emerson about greece
p01930_A,01930,A,don t you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans now miss honeychurch go back keep warm i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling
p01931_A,01931,A,why not
p01932_A,01932,A,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p01933_A,01933,A,is he a friend of yours
p01934_A,01934,A,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p01935_A,01935,A,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p01936_A,01936,A,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p01937_A,01937,A,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p01938_A,01938,A,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p01939_A,01939,A,lucy can always play
p01940_A,01940,A,we had much better let the matter drop
p01941_A,01941,A,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p01942_A,01942,A,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p01943_A,01943,A,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p01944_A,01944,A,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p01945_A,01945,A,she wanted to leave windy corner
p01946_A,01946,A,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p01947_A,01947,A,but my feelings are of no importance i know too well that i get on lucy s nerves our tour was a failure she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mother s money
p01948_A,01948,A,don t neglect the country round the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort
p01949_A,01949,A,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p01950_A,01950,A,prato they must go to prato that place is too sweetly squalid for words i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know
p01951_A,01951,A,it is i who am sorry literary hacks are shameless creatures i believe there s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn t pry
p01952_A,01952,A,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p01953_A,01953,A,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p01954_A,01954,A,the railway oh but i shall die of course it was the railway he is the image of a porter on on the south eastern
p01955_A,01955,A,miss honeychurch listening pouf wouf you naughty girl go away
p01956_A,01956,A,no i agree it s like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls miss lucy you are to go we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear
p01957_A,01957,A,then sit you down observe my foresight
p01958_A,01958,A,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p01959_A,01959,A,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p01960_A,01960,A,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p01961_A,01961,A,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p01962_A,01962,A,not at all i never suggested that
p01963_A,01963,A,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p01964_A,01964,A,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p01965_A,01965,A,it is terrible this havoc among the flowers
p01966_A,01966,A,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p01967_A,01967,A,she is playing again
p01968_A,01968,A,i wonder
p01969_A,01969,A,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p01970_A,01970,A,quite so
p01971_A,01971,A,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p01972_A,01972,A,really now why
p01973_A,01973,A,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p01974_A,01974,A,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p01975_A,01975,A,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p01976_A,01976,A,but here you are as safe as in england signora bertolini is so english
p01977_A,01977,A,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p01978_A,01978,A,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p01979_A,01979,A,mr emerson is engaged but here is his son instead
p01980_A,01980,A,and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here
p01981_A,01981,A,when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose for example it isn t purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect
p01982_A,01982,A,and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch
p01983_A,01983,A,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p01984_A,01984,A,a smell a true florentine smell every city let me teach you has its own smell
p01985_A,01985,A,one doesn t come to italy for niceness one comes for life buon giorno buon giorno look at that adorable wine cart how the driver stares at us dear simple soul buon giorno take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors that is the true democracy though i am a real radical as well there now you re shocked
p01986_A,01986,A,i see i see and now you have gone over to the enemy
p01987_A,01987,A,shameful a manufacturing district i suppose
p01988_A,01988,A,what a delightful part i know it so well it is full of the very nicest people do you know sir harry otway a radical if ever there was
p01989_A,01989,A,and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist
p01990_A,01990,A,oh you have property in surrey
p01991_A,01991,A,bless us bless us and save us we ve lost the way lost lost my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us what are we to do two lone females in an unknown town now this is what i call an adventure oh but that is the word of a craven and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker give it to me i shan t let you carry it we will simply drift stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them i do detest conventional intercourse nasty they are going into the church too oh the britisher abroad
p01992_A,01992,A,look at their figures they walk through my italy like a pair of cows it s very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldn t pass it
p01993_A,01993,A,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p01994_A,01994,A,perhaps as a student of human nature like myself
p01995_A,01995,A,is it a very nice smell
p01996_A,01996,A,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland
p01997_A,01997,A,oh please if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp
p01998_A,01998,A,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p01999_A,01999,A,very well indeed
p02000_A,02000,A,why she rents a field of us how funny
p02001_A,02001,A,hardly any only thirty acres just the garden all downhill and some fields
p02002_A,02002,A,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p02003_A,02003,A,what would you ask us
p02004_A,02004,A,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p02005_A,02005,A,oh dear me no oh no
p02006_A,02006,A,i m sure it s all right the emersons won t hear and they wouldn t mind if they did
p02007_A,02007,A,please i d rather stop here with you
p02008_A,02008,A,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p02009_A,02009,A,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p02010_A,02010,A,don t let us spoil yours have you looked at those saints
p02011_A,02011,A,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p02012_A,02012,A,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p02013_A,02013,A,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p02014_A,02014,A,the old trouble things won t fit
p02015_A,02015,A,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p02016_A,02016,A,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p02017_A,02017,A,poor girl poor girl
p02018_A,02018,A,george don t go george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon
p02019_A,02019,A,oh miss honeychurch that you should come miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry george is so sorry he thought he had a right to try i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first he ought not to have tried i knew nothing about it at all but you must not scold him i taught him to trust in love i said i said true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result poor boy he is so sorry he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean yet miss honeychurch do you remember italy
p02020_A,02020,A,but you do remember it
p02021_A,02021,A,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p02022_A,02022,A,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p02023_A,02023,A,especially as he has gone under
p02024_A,02024,A,gone under naturally
p02025_A,02025,A,as his mother did
p02026_A,02026,A,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p02027_A,02027,A,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p02028_A,02028,A,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p02029_A,02029,A,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p02030_A,02030,A,how good everyone is and look at mr beebe housing me came over this morning and heard i was going here i am so comfortable with a fire
p02031_A,02031,A,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p02032_A,02032,A,all the way to greece to greece
p02033_A,02033,A,certainly you can we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen
p02034_A,02034,A,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow
p02035_A,02035,A,miss honeychurch you do sound tired
p02036_A,02036,A,but you are and there s a look of george about you and what were you saying about going abroad greece greece but you were to be married this year i thought
p02037_A,02037,A,i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse
p02038_A,02038,A,you are leaving him you are leaving the man you love
p02039_A,02039,A,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p02040_A,02040,A,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy
p02041_A,02041,A,i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george they have loved one another all along
p02042_A,02042,A,it is not rubbish it s the part of people that you don t understand
p02043_A,02043,A,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p02044_A,02044,A,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p02045_A,02045,A,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p02046_A,02046,A,my father has that effect on nearly everyone he will try to be kind
p02047_A,02047,A,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p02048_A,02048,A,miss bartlett
p02049_A,02049,A,in the nave
p02050_A,02050,A,you fainted

p02056_A,02056,A,then i don t fetch your photographs
p02057_A,02057,A,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p02058_A,02058,A,things i didn t want
p02059_A,02059,A,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p02060_A,02060,A,i want to ask you something before we go in
p02061_A,02061,A,i nearly fainted myself
p02062_A,02062,A,oh all right
p02063_A,02063,A,i m afraid i don t
p02064_A,02064,A,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p02065_A,02065,A,i don t i shall probably want to live
p02066_A,02066,A,and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up what do you think
p02067_A,02067,A,you and are you tired
p02068_A,02068,A,do you mind being beaten
p02069_A,02069,A,i never said i was
p02070_A,02070,A,you didn t attend
p02071_A,02071,A,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p02072_A,02072,A,i never notice much difference in views
p02073_A,02073,A,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills
p02074_A,02074,A,none why
p02075_A,02075,A,my mother i was meaning
p02076_A,02076,A,am i really to go
p02077_A,02077,A,no nothing to eat
p02078_A,02078,A,but i can t
p02079_A,02079,A,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p02080_A,02080,A,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p02081_A,02081,A,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p02082_A,02082,A,lucy be quick there s no time for us to talk now come to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain i have cared for you since that man died i cannot live without you i thought but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered i called i wanted to live and have my chance of joy
p02083_A,02083,A,why shouldn t i be a baby
p02084_A,02084,A,quite right it is nonsense
p02085_A,02085,A,why shouldn t i laugh what s there to cry at kiss me here any letters
p02086_A,02086,A,now kiss me here then here lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows
p02087_A,02087,A,anything good in freddy s letter
p02088_A,02088,A,what does he say
p02089_A,02089,A,you may well wish that
p02090_A,02090,A,oh bother that man
p02091_A,02091,A,look at the lights going over the bridge
p02092_A,02092,A,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p02093_A,02093,A,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p02094_A,02094,A,or did she mean it
p02095_A,02095,A,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p02096_A,02096,A,i am not touchy i hope it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are
p02097_A,02097,A,i hope we all try
p02098_A,02098,A,oh good gracious me where where
p02099_A,02099,A,oh what have i done
p02100_A,02100,A,i i am very sorry
p02101_A,02101,A,perfectly well absolutely well
p02102_A,02102,A,how very kind you have been i might have hurt myself falling but now i am well i can go alone thank you oh my photographs
p02103_A,02103,A,i bought some photographs at alinari s i must have dropped them out there in the square would you add to your kindness by fetching them
p02104_A,02104,A,yes i am thank you so very much
p02105_A,02105,A,but i had rather
p02106_A,02106,A,i had rather be alone
p02107_A,02107,A,and the murderer tried to kiss him you say how very odd italians are and gave himself up to the police mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterday what was that what did you throw in
p02108_A,02108,A,where are the photographs i believe it was my photographs that you threw away
p02109_A,02109,A,mr emerson
p02110_A,02110,A,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p02111_A,02111,A,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p02112_A,02112,A,and this is the real point you know how silly people are gossiping ladies especially i am afraid you understand what i mean
p02113_A,02113,A,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p02114_A,02114,A,thank you so much and would you well thank you so much how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life
p02115_A,02115,A,but why mr emerson what do you mean
p02116_A,02116,A,what fun cecil read away come mr emerson sit down after all your energy
p02117_A,02117,A,of course i m not
p02118_A,02118,A,yes i don t see you re such a splendid player though the light was behind you and it was in my eyes
p02119_A,02119,A,why you did
p02120_A,02120,A,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p02121_A,02121,A,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p02122_A,02122,A,what do you mean
p02123_A,02123,A,what a splendid idea i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again i m so sorry he s not so well
p02124_A,02124,A,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p02125_A,02125,A,you spoke of
p02126_A,02126,A,no discussion
p02127_A,02127,A,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p02128_A,02128,A,you are merely ridiculous
p02129_A,02129,A,i can scarcely discuss
p02130_A,02130,A,you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit
p02131_A,02131,A,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p02132_A,02132,A,no it isn t because it is the room i had and i had your father s room i forget why charlotte made me for some reason george you baby get up
p02133_A,02133,A,oh bother charlotte what can such people be made of
p02134_A,02134,A,now you get up off the cold floor or you ll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly
p02135_A,02135,A,just a line from freddy
p02136_A,02136,A,not yet
p02137_A,02137,A,but it will all come right in the end he has to build us both up from the beginning again i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women he has for the second time quite altered why will men have theories about women i haven t any about men i wish too that mr beebe
p02138_A,02138,A,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p02139_A,02139,A,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p02140_A,02140,A,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p02141_A,02141,A,oh no she didn t see him she was upstairs with old mrs beebe don t you remember and then went straight to the church she said so
p02142_A,02142,A,how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment
p02143_A,02143,A,mean what george
p02144_A,02144,A,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p02145_A,02145,A,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p02146_A,02146,A,perhaps he is i don t remember
p02147_A,02147,A,were you snubbed
p02148_A,02148,A,i i ll come up to tennis if i can manage it
p02149_A,02149,A,pardon me the chapel is somewhat small for two parties we will incommode you no longer
p02150_A,02150,A,victory at last
p02151_A,02151,A,would render a correct meaning
p02152_A,02152,A,who is she
p02153_A,02153,A,introduce me
p02154_A,02154,A,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p02155_A,02155,A,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p02156_A,02156,A,fa niente sono vecchia
p02157_A,02157,A,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p02158_A,02158,A,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p02159_A,02159,A,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p02160_A,02160,A,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p02161_A,02161,A,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p02162_A,02162,A,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p02163_A,02163,A,italians dear you know
p02164_A,02164,A,what was that
p02165_A,02165,A,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p02166_A,02166,A,oh let me congratulate you after your despair of yesterday what a fortunate thing
p02167_A,02167,A,i do hope she s nice and what is the plot
p02168_A,02168,A,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p02169_A,02169,A,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p02170_A,02170,A,she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word none but the superficial would be shocked at her we had a long talk yesterday she believes in justice and truth and human interest she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman mr eager why how nice what a pleasant surprise
p02171_A,02171,A,we were chatting to miss lavish
p02172_A,02172,A,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p02173_A,02173,A,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned
p02174_A,02174,A,one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home
p02175_A,02175,A,willingly would i purchase
p02176_A,02176,A,how wonderfully people rise in these days
p02177_A,02177,A,is he a journalist now
p02178_A,02178,A,oh so he has a wife
p02179_A,02179,A,lucy dear
p02180_A,02180,A,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p02181_A,02181,A,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p02182_A,02182,A,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p02183_A,02183,A,and how came we to have you here
p02184_A,02184,A,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p02185_A,02185,A,ignore him
p02186_A,02186,A,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p02187_A,02187,A,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p02188_A,02188,A,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p02189_A,02189,A,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p02190_A,02190,A,and you and your friend
p02191_A,02191,A,to speak plainly it is i will say no more

p02193_A,02193,A,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p02194_A,02194,A,i must be going
p02195_A,02195,A,so miss honeychurch you are travelling as a student of art
p02196_A,02196,A,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p02197_A,02197,A,typical behaviour in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down
p02198_A,02198,A,he died by the fountain i believe
p02199_A,02199,A,were over at the loggia

p02203_A,02203,A,no of course
p02204_A,02204,A,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p02205_A,02205,A,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p02206_A,02206,A,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p02207_A,02207,A,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p02208_A,02208,A,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day
p02209_A,02209,A,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure

p02214_A,02214,A,he was not driving us well he jolted us
p02215_A,02215,A,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature

p02238_A,02238,A,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p02239_A,02239,A,i feel never mind
p02240_A,02240,A,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p02241_A,02241,A,nor me
p02242_A,02242,A,he asked me for my permission also
p02243_A,02243,A,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p02244_A,02244,A,i said to cecil
p02245_A,02245,A,the bother is this
p02246_A,02246,A,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p02247_A,02247,A,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p02248_A,02248,A,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p02249_A,02249,A,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p02250_A,02250,A,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p02251_A,02251,A,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p02252_A,02252,A,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p02253_A,02253,A,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p02254_A,02254,A,cross it out too

p02266_A,02266,A,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p02267_A,02267,A,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p02268_A,02268,A,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p02269_A,02269,A,do you indeed dear how interesting
p02270_A,02270,A,just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse i said dear mrs vyse
p02271_A,02271,A,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me
p02272_A,02272,A,you what do you mean
p02273_A,02273,A,how very odd of him
p02274_A,02274,A,what do you know about lucy or girls or anything what ever did you say
p02275_A,02275,A,what a helpful answer
p02276_A,02276,A,freddy you must come there they still are
p02277_A,02277,A,peeping like that can t i look out of my own window still page 322
p02278_A,02278,A,i hope you gave a careful answer dear
p02279_A,02279,A,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p02280_A,02280,A,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p02281_A,02281,A,well i like him i know his mother he s good he s clever he s rich he s well connected oh you needn t kick the piano he s well connected i ll say it again if you like he s well connected and he has beautiful manners
p02282_A,02282,A,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p02283_A,02283,A,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p02284_A,02284,A,don t interrupt so foolishly where was i oh yes no i ll cross that last bit out it looks patronizing i ll stop at or shall i cross that out too
p02285_A,02285,A,then the whole thing runs
p02286_A,02286,A,hush dear
p02287_A,02287,A,emerson freddy do you know what emersons they are
p02288_A,02288,A,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p02289_A,02289,A,murdered his wife lucy don t desert us go on playing bumble puppy really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place that s the second murderer i ve heard of as being there whatever was charlotte doing to stop by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time
p02290_A,02290,A,good gracious me dear so it s you what miserable management why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on
p02291_A,02291,A,dear no doubt you re right as usual but you are in no position to argue come lucy oh look don t look oh poor mr beebe how unfortunate again
p02292_A,02292,A,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p02293_A,02293,A,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p02294_A,02294,A,mr beebe i m thankful simply thankful
p02295_A,02295,A,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me
p02296_A,02296,A,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy

p02299_A,02299,A,plenty of society
p02300_A,02300,A,difference i don t see any difference fences are fences especially when they are in the same place
p02301_A,02301,A,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p02302_A,02302,A,let s hope that mrs harris there warn t no sich person
p02303_A,02303,A,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p02304_A,02304,A,men don t gossip over tea cups if they get drunk there s an end of them they lie down comfortably and sleep it off if they re vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves it doesn t spread so give me a man of course provided he s clean
p02305_A,02305,A,gracious alive whoever were those unfortunate people oh dears look away and poor mr beebe too whatever has happened
p02306_A,02306,A,oh poor mr beebe was that his waistcoat we left in the path cecil mr beebe s waistcoat
p02307_A,02307,A,i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond
p02308_A,02308,A,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p02309_A,02309,A,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p02310_A,02310,A,i hope so
p02311_A,02311,A,we were speaking of motives
p02312_A,02312,A,come this way immediately
p02313_A,02313,A,no business of ours
p02314_A,02314,A,he is the clever sort like myself
p02315_A,02315,A,hear hear
p02316_A,02316,A,i say lucy
p02317_A,02317,A,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p02318_A,02318,A,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p02319_A,02319,A,we go with lucy
p02320_A,02320,A,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p02321_A,02321,A,mr beebe
p02322_A,02322,A,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p02323_A,02323,A,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p02324_A,02324,A,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p02325_A,02325,A,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p02326_A,02326,A,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p02327_A,02327,A,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p02328_A,02328,A,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p02329_A,02329,A,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p02330_A,02330,A,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p02331_A,02331,A,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p02332_A,02332,A,i quite agree at present she has none
p02333_A,02333,A,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p02334_A,02334,A,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p02335_A,02335,A,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p02336_A,02336,A,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p02337_A,02337,A,broken what do you mean
p02338_A,02338,A,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p02339_A,02339,A,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p02340_A,02340,A,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p02341_A,02341,A,i know i know i can t think why mrs honeychurch allows it
p02342_A,02342,A,news i don t understand you news
p02343_A,02343,A,has he indeed
p02344_A,02344,A,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p02345_A,02345,A,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p02346_A,02346,A,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p02347_A,02347,A,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p02348_A,02348,A,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p02349_A,02349,A,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p02350_A,02350,A,she has none
p02351_A,02351,A,at present
p02352_A,02352,A,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p02353_A,02353,A,in what way
p02354_A,02354,A,but the string never broke
p02355_A,02355,A,it has broken now
p02356_A,02356,A,i meant that she is going to marry me
p02357_A,02357,A,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p02358_A,02358,A,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p02359_A,02359,A,have you heard oh mr beebe have you heard the news
p02360_A,02360,A,here lennie the bass
p02361_A,02361,A,oh must you yes do not the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full already i m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it yes charlotte i don t want you do go there s nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it
p02362_A,02362,A,it gets too dark this comes of putting off we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece i don t know what the world s coming to
p02363_A,02363,A,i don t see why greece is necessary but as you do i suppose it is all right it must be something i can t understand lucy let s tell her lucy
p02364_A,02364,A,indeed i have mrs honeychurch i m going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally i m too shy i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother and now i want my tea
p02365_A,02365,A,but they really are coming now i wrote to miss teresa a few days ago she was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably they are coming i heard from them this morning
p02366_A,02366,A,these particular emersons consisted of a father and a son the son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immature pessimism et cetera our special joy was the father such a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife
p02367_A,02367,A,hi hi ladies
p02368_A,02368,A,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may
p02369_A,02369,A,mrs honeychurch go to greece she must come up to the house and let s talk it over do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse
p02370_A,02370,A,good now come up to the house
p02371_A,02371,A,she is playing the piano i didn t know that miss honeychurch sang too
p02372_A,02372,A,do you go to much of this sort of thing
p02373_A,02373,A,is it typical of country society
p02374_A,02374,A,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p02375_A,02375,A,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p02376_A,02376,A,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p02377_A,02377,A,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p02378_A,02378,A,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p02379_A,02379,A,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p02380_A,02380,A,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p02381_A,02381,A,what sort of things
p02382_A,02382,A,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p02383_A,02383,A,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p02384_A,02384,A,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p02385_A,02385,A,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p02386_A,02386,A,hopeless vulgarian
p02387_A,02387,A,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p02388_A,02388,A,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p02389_A,02389,A,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p02390_A,02390,A,are there two ways
p02391_A,02391,A,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p02392_A,02392,A,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p02393_A,02393,A,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p02394_A,02394,A,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p02395_A,02395,A,a drawing room pray with no view
p02396_A,02396,A,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p02397_A,02397,A,why do you call it that
p02398_A,02398,A,and you
p02399_A,02399,A,who found you out
p02400_A,02400,A,poor girl lucy
p02401_A,02401,A,lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before

p02407_A,02407,A,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p02408_A,02408,A,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p02409_A,02409,A,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p02410_A,02410,A,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p02411_A,02411,A,no you don t
p02412_A,02412,A,so you do love me little thing
p02413_A,02413,A,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett

p02421_A,02421,A,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p02422_A,02422,A,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p02423_A,02423,A,what height
p02424_A,02424,A,the misses alan aren t that
p02425_A,02425,A,oh cecil
p02426_A,02426,A,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p02427_A,02427,A,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p02428_A,02428,A,which way shall we go
p02429_A,02429,A,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p02430_A,02430,A,haven t i the wood then
p02431_A,02431,A,a room
p02432_A,02432,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p02433_A,02433,A,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p02434_A,02434,A,yes with no view i fancy why not
p02435_A,02435,A,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p02436_A,02436,A,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p02437_A,02437,A,i bathed here too till i was found out then there was a row
p02438_A,02438,A,charlotte she was stopping with us charlotte charlotte

p02444_A,02444,A,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p02445_A,02445,A,what an odd place to meet people i don t quite understand
p02446_A,02446,A,but cecil
p02447_A,02447,A,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before

p02452_A,02452,A,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p02453_A,02453,A,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p02454_A,02454,A,i suppose so mother would it be
p02455_A,02455,A,we weren t talking of real fences
p02456_A,02456,A,he was such a nice old man i m sure well i did try to sift the thing mr eager would never come to the point he prefers it vague said the old man had practically murdered his wife had murdered her in the sight of god
p02457_A,02457,A,i don t know i hate him i ve heard him lecture on giotto i hate him nothing can hide a petty nature i hate him
p02458_A,02458,A,summer street of course
p02459_A,02459,A,what a weathercock sir harry is i wish i had never bothered over it at all
p02460_A,02460,A,emerson s a common enough name
p02461_A,02461,A,no i don t think so mother cecil s all right
p02462_A,02462,A,i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that
p02463_A,02463,A,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p02464_A,02464,A,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p02465_A,02465,A,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p02466_A,02466,A,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p02467_A,02467,A,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p02468_A,02468,A,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p02469_A,02469,A,we mustn t be unjust to people
p02470_A,02470,A,all right mother
p02471_A,02471,A,yes i really can t stop i must dress too
p02472_A,02472,A,all right
p02473_A,02473,A,her what
p02474_A,02474,A,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p02475_A,02475,A,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p02476_A,02476,A,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p02477_A,02477,A,i tore the thing up
p02478_A,02478,A,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p02479_A,02479,A,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p02480_A,02480,A,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p02481_A,02481,A,i won t have her
p02482_A,02482,A,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p02483_A,02483,A,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p02484_A,02484,A,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p02485_A,02485,A,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p02486_A,02486,A,oh splendid oh thank you
p02487_A,02487,A,that s all right we just got through that time
p02488_A,02488,A,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p02489_A,02489,A,it s only for a few days
p02490_A,02490,A,oh mother what rubbish you talk of course i m not tired of windy corner
p02491_A,02491,A,half a minute would be nearer
p02492_A,02492,A,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p02493_A,02493,A,i want more independence
p02494_A,02494,A,perhaps i spoke hastily
p02495_A,02495,A,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p02496_A,02496,A,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p02497_A,02497,A,i beg your pardon
p02498_A,02498,A,can t we have the hood down
p02499_A,02499,A,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p02500_A,02500,A,i shall hate those miss alans just because they re old and silly one s expected to say how sweet i hate their if ing and but ing and and ing and poor lucy serve her right worn to a shadow
p02501_A,02501,A,oh good gracious there isn t going to be another muddle do you notice lucy i m always right i said don t interfere with cissie villa i m always right i m quite uneasy at being always right so often
p02502_A,02502,A,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p02503_A,02503,A,don t be rude dear lucy don t screech it s a new bad habit you re getting into
p02504_A,02504,A,hush dears and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first all these colds come of not drying thoroughly
p02505_A,02505,A,bow lucy better bow whoever is it i shall bow
p02506_A,02506,A,lucy is anything the matter with cecil
p02507_A,02507,A,perhaps he s tired because otherwise because otherwise i cannot account for him
p02508_A,02508,A,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p02509_A,02509,A,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p02510_A,02510,A,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p02511_A,02511,A,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p02512_A,02512,A,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p02513_A,02513,A,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p02514_A,02514,A,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p02515_A,02515,A,go and dress dear you ll be late
p02516_A,02516,A,don t say and stop go
p02517_A,02517,A,lucy what a noise you re making i have something to say to you did you say you had had a letter from charlotte
p02518_A,02518,A,how s charlotte
p02519_A,02519,A,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p02520_A,02520,A,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p02521_A,02521,A,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p02522_A,02522,A,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p02523_A,02523,A,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p02524_A,02524,A,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p02525_A,02525,A,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p02526_A,02526,A,and i have been thinking surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at tunbridge wells finish i have not seen poor charlotte for so long
p02527_A,02527,A,nonsense it can
p02528_A,02528,A,minnie can sleep with you
p02529_A,02529,A,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p02530_A,02530,A,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p02531_A,02531,A,from your own account you told her as much
p02532_A,02532,A,lucy lucy what s that book who s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil
p02533_A,02533,A,not very dutiful
p02534_A,02534,A,all right dear i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias
p02535_A,02535,A,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p02536_A,02536,A,here s mr beebe
p02537_A,02537,A,no one will see lucy off she doesn t like it
p02538_A,02538,A,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p02539_A,02539,A,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p02540_A,02540,A,but why at all
p02541_A,02541,A,you re tired of windy corner
p02542_A,02542,A,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p02543_A,02543,A,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p02544_A,02544,A,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p02545_A,02545,A,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p02546_A,02546,A,more every moment
p02547_A,02547,A,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p02548_A,02548,A,there you go
p02549_A,02549,A,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p02550_A,02550,A,very well old lady stop the horse
p02551_A,02551,A,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p02552_A,02552,A,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p02553_A,02553,A,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p02554_A,02554,A,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p02555_A,02555,A,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p02556_A,02556,A,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p02557_A,02557,A,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p02558_A,02558,A,aha young people young people
p02559_A,02559,A,and all the capitals different one with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flack s initials everyone different
p02560_A,02560,A,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p02561_A,02561,A,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p02562_A,02562,A,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p02563_A,02563,A,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p02564_A,02564,A,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p02565_A,02565,A,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p02566_A,02566,A,yes indeed and at the present moment homeless i heard from them last week miss teresa and miss catharine alan i m really not joking they are quite the right people mr beebe knows them too may i tell them to write to you

p02726_A,02726,A,no of course not really
p02727_A,02727,A,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p02728_A,02728,A,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p02729_A,02729,A,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should

p02731_A,02731,A,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p02732_A,02732,A,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p02733_A,02733,A,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p02734_A,02734,A,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p02735_A,02735,A,what s the good of a scene
p02736_A,02736,A,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p02737_A,02737,A,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p02738_A,02738,A,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p02739_A,02739,A,true on the whole
p02740_A,02740,A,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p02741_A,02741,A,what do you mean by a new voice
p02742_A,02742,A,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p02743_A,02743,A,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p02744_A,02744,A,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p02745_A,02745,A,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness

p02751_A,02751,A,it is so i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p02752_A,02752,A,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p02753_A,02753,A,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p02754_A,02754,A,not while mr emerson is here to entertain us
p02755_A,02755,A,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book

p02761_A,02761,A,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p02762_A,02762,A,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p02763_A,02763,A,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p02764_A,02764,A,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p02765_A,02765,A,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p02766_A,02766,A,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p02767_A,02767,A,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p02768_A,02768,A,it is true
p02769_A,02769,A,true every word it is a revelation it is i
p02770_A,02770,A,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p02771_A,02771,A,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p02772_A,02772,A,of course i don t think that you are not that kind lucy
p02773_A,02773,A,i may have said that in the past i shall never say it again you have taught me better of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadn t known of up till now
p02774_A,02774,A,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p02775_A,02775,A,let me light your candle shall i thank you good night again god bless you lucy

p02781_A,02781,A,i am not bad
p02782_A,02782,A,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p02783_A,02783,A,my father says that there is only one perfect view the view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it
p02784_A,02784,A,no he isn t well
p02785_A,02785,A,then certainly i won t play
p02786_A,02786,A,i agree with you mr vyse you had much better not play much better not
p02787_A,02787,A,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p02788_A,02788,A,h m
p02789_A,02789,A,i expect your father has been reading dante

p02792_A,02792,A,then you don t see the wonder of this greek visit i haven t been to greece myself and don t mean to go and i can t imagine any of my friends going it is altogether too big for our little lot don t you think so italy is just about as much as we can manage italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilish i am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus all right freddy i am not being clever upon my word i am not i took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when you ve done with them i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian big enough in all conscience the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me there the contrast is just as much as i can realize but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria
p02793_A,02793,A,they re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy won t play with me in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday
p02794_A,02794,A,but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you a gentleman is such a stand by we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you it is not every young man who would be so unselfish but perhaps he will come out and join you later on
p02795_A,02795,A,or does his work keep him in london
p02796_A,02796,A,really how funny i should have thought that in this case
p02797_A,02797,A,however we shall see him when he sees you off i do so long to see him
p02798_A,02798,A,no i hate seeings off
p02799_A,02799,A,oh mrs honeychurch you aren t going it is such a pleasure to have met you
p02800_A,02800,A,is that house to let again powell

p02802_A,02802,A,they have gone then
p02803_A,02803,A,yes miss
p02804_A,02804,A,it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his father s rheumatism has come on so he can t stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished
p02805_A,02805,A,yes miss they have gone
p02806_A,02806,A,a lady to wait sir
p02807_A,02807,A,signorino domani faremo uno giro
p02808_A,02808,A,signorino domani faremo
p02809_A,02809,A,signorino domani faremo uno giro
p02810_A,02810,A,signorino domani faremo uno giro
p02811_A,02811,A,lascia prego lascia siamo sposati
p02812_A,02812,A,i can tell you nothing aunt juley i know no more than you do we met we only met the father and mother abroad last spring i know so little that i didn t even know their son s name it s all so
p02813_A,02813,A,who knows aunt juley who knows
p02814_A,02814,A,who knows
p02815_A,02815,A,i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street
p02816_A,02816,A,the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know
p02817_A,02817,A,exactly germans are too thorough
p02818_A,02818,A,oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down
p02819_A,02819,A,i gathered nothing
p02820_A,02820,A,in that case i can make no plans don t you see
p02821_A,02821,A,i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby
p02822_A,02822,A,aunt juley i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering
p02823_A,02823,A,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk
p02824_A,02824,A,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say
p02825_A,02825,A,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off
p02826_A,02826,A,can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different
p02827_A,02827,A,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong
p02828_A,02828,A,oh i used an affected word i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen
p02829_A,02829,A,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p02830_A,02830,A,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p02831_A,02831,A,oh but helen isn t a girl with no interests she has plenty of other things and other people to think about she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them
p02832_A,02832,A,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us i didn t tell you at the time it might have made you angry and you had enough to worry you but i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them she didn t answer it
p02833_A,02833,A,i wonder or was it sensible
p02834_A,02834,A,in either case one can class it as reassuring
p02835_A,02835,A,oh certainly fiendishly careful
p02836_A,02836,A,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p02837_A,02837,A,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p02838_A,02838,A,mr wilcox possibly
p02839_A,02839,A,it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans
p02840_A,02840,A,because because i d sooner risk it
p02841_A,02841,A,i hope to risk things all my life
p02842_A,02842,A,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money
p02843_A,02843,A,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none
p02844_A,02844,A,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin
p02845_A,02845,A,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them
p02846_A,02846,A,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality
p02847_A,02847,A,what is it
p02848_A,02848,A,why shouldn t she
p02849_A,02849,A,i had worked round to myself as usual
p02850_A,02850,A,too difficult ask me another am i for poverty or for riches for riches hurrah for riches
p02851_A,02851,A,yes for riches money for ever
p02852_A,02852,A,thank you so much aunt juley while i have talked theories you have done the flowers
p02853_A,02853,A,well would you be very kind would you come round with me to the registry office there s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no
p02854_A,02854,A,shan t i go up to town to day take the house if it s the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow and start enjoying myself i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind
p02855_A,02855,A,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p02856_A,02856,A,not want but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles s
p02857_A,02857,A,helen won t be able to stop aunt juley she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
p02858_A,02858,A,yes dear
p02859_A,02859,A,i have been for a little walk with miss conder
p02860_A,02860,A,i have tibby aunt juley
p02861_A,02861,A,helen is odd very
p02862_A,02862,A,in that case it is far too sudden
p02863_A,02863,A,but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely
p02864_A,02864,A,but margaret dear
p02865_A,02865,A,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret
p02866_A,02866,A,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do
p02867_A,02867,A,of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone and that reminds me helen s letter
p02868_A,02868,A,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather
p02869_A,02869,A,then in that case
p02870_A,02870,A,on the contrary
p02871_A,02871,A,then in that case my dear why go down i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you
p02872_A,02872,A,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them
p02873_A,02873,A,dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters
p02874_A,02874,A,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to
p02875_A,02875,A,i think probably it must but slowly
p02876_A,02876,A,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me
p02877_A,02877,A,so uncivilised
p02878_A,02878,A,margaret is helen all right
p02879_A,02879,A,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
p02880_A,02880,A,a specially loud part of course i do not go in for being musical i only care for music a very different thing but still i will say this for myself i do know when i like a thing and when i don t some people are the same about pictures they can go into a picture gallery miss conder can and say straight off what they feel all round the wall i never could do that but music is so different from pictures to my mind when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything there was a thing something about a faun in french which helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
p02881_A,02881,A,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p02882_A,02882,A,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow
p02883_A,02883,A,how very rude
p02884_A,02884,A,no margaret most rude
p02885_A,02885,A,but you will be careful won t you
p02886_A,02886,A,helen cannot deceive me she does mind
p02887_A,02887,A,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be
p02888_A,02888,A,i knew it and there s mr wilcox
p02889_A,02889,A,it s as well to be prepared
p02890_A,02890,A,but imagine the evenings turn the electric light on here or there and it s almost the same room one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you ll see them and the next you yours and they ll see you impossible to sit out on the balconies impossible to water the plants or even speak imagine going out of the front door and they come out opposite at the same moment and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you d rather risk it
p02891_A,02891,A,oh margaret most dangerous
p02892_A,02892,A,oh shame what a shocking speech
p02893_A,02893,A,but this is something quite new
p02894_A,02894,A,i call that rather cynical
p02895_A,02895,A,that s more like socialism
p02896_A,02896,A,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh
p02897_A,02897,A,helen was looking up at the wilcoxes flat
p02898_A,02898,A,i beg your pardon i interrupted you what was it you were saying about reality
p02899_A,02899,A,do tell me this at all events are you for the rich or for the poor
p02900_A,02900,A,for riches
p02901_A,02901,A,so am i and so i am afraid are most of my acquaintances at swanage but i am surprised that you agree with us
p02902_A,02902,A,not at all dear i wish you would let me help you in more important things
p02903_A,02903,A,staring most rudely
p02904_A,02904,A,you needn t go though
p02905_A,02905,A,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p02906_A,02906,A,margaret magsy it isn t true surely what mr wilcox says that you want to go away early next week
p02907_A,02907,A,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down
p02908_A,02908,A,to really take my tiresome chest in hand important margaret dear take the lulworth when helen comes
p02909_A,02909,A,how very odd of helen mr wilcox
p02910_A,02910,A,can he spare you margaret important i should like you to have some companion to take walks with do try miss conder
p02911_A,02911,A,but she is not really interesting if only you had helen
p02912_A,02912,A,no but he has to do his chinese some real companion is what you need really helen is odd
p02913_A,02913,A,not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once
p02914_A,02914,A,i want a house its name is howards lodge do you know where it is
p02915_A,02915,A,mr wilcox she s wanting howards end
p02916_A,02916,A,excuse me asking but are you the younger mr wilcox or the elder
p02917_A,02917,A,i am miss schlegel s aunt i ought to introduce myself oughtn t i my name is mrs munt
p02918_A,02918,A,that is very kind
p02919_A,02919,A,my niece is not with you by any chance
p02920_A,02920,A,i should like to come up
p02921_A,02921,A,in front if i may then we can talk
p02922_A,02922,A,this is very good of you very good indeed it is just what i should have wished
p02923_A,02923,A,you see we heard from helen this morning
p02924_A,02924,A,not at all mr wilcox
p02925_A,02925,A,i should love going through the village naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you you can well imagine that the news was a great shock to us
p02926_A,02926,A,mr wilcox margaret has told me everything everything i have seen helen s letter
p02927_A,02927,A,about helen helen of course helen is a very exceptional person i am sure you will let me say this feeling towards her as you do indeed all the schlegels are exceptional i come in no spirit of interference but it was a great shock
p02928_A,02928,A,margaret could not come herself on account of poor tibby so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk
p02929_A,02929,A,helen mr wilcox my niece and you
p02930_A,02930,A,i trust there has been no misunderstanding her letter certainly read that way
p02931_A,02931,A,that you and she
p02932_A,02932,A,then you didn t the least
p02933_A,02933,A,but you are paul
p02934_A,02934,A,then why did you say so at the station
p02935_A,02935,A,yes they care for one another very much indeed i dare say they will tell you about it by and by we heard this morning
p02936_A,02936,A,if that is your attitude mr wilcox i prefer to walk
p02937_A,02937,A,i quite agree sir the thing is impossible and i will come up and stop it my niece is a very exceptional person and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her considering she has only known your brother since wednesday and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel
p02938_A,02938,A,no need to warn us mr wilcox i assure you the warning is all the other way my niece has been very foolish and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me
p02939_A,02939,A,if i were a man mr wilcox for that last remark i d box your ears you re not fit to clean my niece s boots to sit in the same room with her and you dare you actually dare i decline to argue with such a person
p02940_A,02940,A,and all that i know is
p02941_A,02941,A,oh my darling helen
p02942_A,02942,A,the younger can i do anything for you
p02943_A,02943,A,i ll call you a cab no wait a mo our motor s here i ll run you up in it
p02944_A,02944,A,not at all if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office this way
p02945_A,02945,A,no i came over with my father he has gone on north in your train you ll see miss schlegel at lunch you re coming up to lunch i hope
p02946_A,02946,A,in front or behind which do you prefer it may be windy in front
p02947_A,02947,A,but excuse me one moment i can t think what they re doing with that parcel hi hi you there are you going to keep me waiting all day parcel for wilcox howards end just look sharp this station s abominably organised if i had my way the whole lot of em should get the sack may i help you in
p02948_A,02948,A,very good of you to say so i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train
p02949_A,02949,A,extremely sorry mrs munt
p02950_A,02950,A,and do you object to going through the village it is rather a longer spin but i have one or two commissions

p02952_A,02952,A,i beg your pardon i didn t catch
p02953_A,02953,A,i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads
p02954_A,02954,A,i m sorry to be so dense but i still haven t quite understood
p02955_A,02955,A,miss schlegel and myself
p02956_A,02956,A,what way
p02957_A,02957,A,i think i catch your meaning what an extraordinary mistake
p02958_A,02958,A,scarcely as i am already engaged to another lady oh good god don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s
p02959_A,02959,A,i m not
p02960_A,02960,A,i said nothing of the sort i beg your pardon i did not my name is charles do you mean to tell me that paul do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece
p02961_A,02961,A,the idiot the idiot the little fool
p02962_A,02962,A,i beg you will do no such thing i take you up this moment to the house let me tell you the thing s impossible and must be stopped
p02963_A,02963,A,could you possibly lower your voice the shopman will overhear i warn you paul hasn t a penny it s useless
p02964_A,02964,A,he has to make his way out in nigeria he couldn t think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate and is in other ways why hasn t he told us of course he s ashamed he knows he s been a fool and so he has a downright fool whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news
p02965_A,02965,A,all i know is she s spread the thing and he hasn t and my father s away and i
p02966_A,02966,A,don t let them know they are never to know
p02967_A,02967,A,i expect so
p02968_A,02968,A,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p02969_A,02969,A,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p02970_A,02970,A,oh do stop
p02971_A,02971,A,here s the house a regular hen coop
p02972_A,02972,A,careful over what aunt juley

p02974_A,02974,A,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train
p02975_A,02975,A,oh i do wonder i do wonder whether she s taken the house
p02976_A,02976,A,meg and i haven t got such tender hearts if there s a chance of a cheap house we go for it
p02977_A,02977,A,you see the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles they have one ducie street two howards end where my great rumpus was three a country seat in shropshire four charles has a house in hilton and five another near epsom and six evie will have a house when she marries and probably a pied a terre in the country which makes seven oh yes and paul a hut in africa makes eight i wish we could get howards end that was something like a dear little house didn t you think so aunt juley
p02978_A,02978,A,paul paul paul is there any truth in this
p02979_A,02979,A,i didn t i don t
p02980_A,02980,A,charles dear charles dear charles one doesn t ask plain questions there aren t such things miss schlegel would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room whichever you think best paul do find evie and tell her lunch for six but i m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it
p02981_A,02981,A,mother are you aware that paul has been playing the fool again
p02982_A,02982,A,why be so polite to servants they don t understand it
p02983_A,02983,A,i understand at least i understand as much as ever is understood of these things tell me now what happened on the monday morning
p02984_A,02984,A,how helen
p02985_A,02985,A,was paul there
p02986_A,02986,A,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife
p02987_A,02987,A,knew what
p02988_A,02988,A,oh she must have overheard you
p02989_A,02989,A,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end
p02990_A,02990,A,don t you feel it now
p02991_A,02991,A,helen let us in
p02992_A,02992,A,you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella
p02993_A,02993,A,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p02994_A,02994,A,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p02995_A,02995,A,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p02996_A,02996,A,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p02997_A,02997,A,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p02998_A,02998,A,leave tibby alone
p02999_A,02999,A,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p03000_A,03000,A,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p03001_A,03001,A,with an india shawl over her shoulders
p03002_A,03002,A,how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art
p03003_A,03003,A,i m not grave
p03004_A,03004,A,helen you must tell me whether this thing worries you
p03005_A,03005,A,the ws coming
p03006_A,03006,A,if even that worries you we could arrange something there s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease thanks to our money we might even go away for a little
p03007_A,03007,A,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p03008_A,03008,A,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p03009_A,03009,A,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p03010_A,03010,A,i have had a correspondence with her son he was winding up the estate and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything i thought it good of him considering i knew her so little i said that she had once spoken of giving me a christmas present but we both forgot about it afterwards
p03011_A,03011,A,not anything to do with bracknell
p03012_A,03012,A,now helen what did really happen
p03013_A,03013,A,but what an extraordinary
p03014_A,03014,A,but how on earth
p03015_A,03015,A,bag it by all means i m not sure that this is so funny helen it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere doesn t it
p03016_A,03016,A,her husband may be though
p03017_A,03017,A,was she pretty
p03018_A,03018,A,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september
p03019_A,03019,A,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p03020_A,03020,A,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p03021_A,03021,A,heavens no
p03022_A,03022,A,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p03023_A,03023,A,i must show you a picture upstairs
p03024_A,03024,A,are we really going to follow up mr bast
p03025_A,03025,A,i think we won t
p03026_A,03026,A,it s no good i think unless you really mean to know people the discussion brought that home to me we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse we mustn t play at friendship no it s no good
p03027_A,03027,A,just so and possibly worse than dull
p03028_A,03028,A,but he said something about a concert and an umbrella
p03029_A,03029,A,helen come to bed
p03030_A,03030,A,very much what one chooses it s something that isn t money one can t say more
p03031_A,03031,A,it seems so
p03032_A,03032,A,now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it s that for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people
p03033_A,03033,A,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p03034_A,03034,A,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
p03035_A,03035,A,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p03036_A,03036,A,porphyrion fire insurance company
p03037_A,03037,A,i hadn t thought of that
p03038_A,03038,A,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p03039_A,03039,A,and some people are lucky enough to have both you re doing yourself proud mr wilcox my congratulations
p03040_A,03040,A,i quite agree and that s why i was curious to know is it a solid well established concern
p03041_A,03041,A,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p03042_A,03042,A,so you like carlyle
p03043_A,03043,A,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p03044_A,03044,A,you in there
p03045_A,03045,A,why you re all alone
p03046_A,03046,A,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later mr w much concerned and slightly titillated
p03047_A,03047,A,well done but come into the drawing room now and don t talk about him to the wilcoxes make light of the whole thing
p03048_A,03048,A,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p03049_A,03049,A,interesting people don t get one houses
p03050_A,03050,A,it s a better vein than the cosmopolitan now children which is it to be you know the ducie street house shall i say yes or shall i say no tibby love which i m specially anxious to pin you both it depends on nothing of the sort say yes i think that our race is degenerating we cannot settle even this little thing what will it be like when we have to settle a big one
p03051_A,03051,A,helen may be right
p03052_A,03052,A,wait one minute
p03053_A,03053,A,oh really
p03054_A,03054,A,what do you know
p03055_A,03055,A,but we would still see each other very often and you
p03056_A,03056,A,what s happened to you
p03057_A,03057,A,i don t know what s happened to either of us we must both have gone mad look here sit down
p03058_A,03058,A,there now whatever whatever is the matter
p03059_A,03059,A,oh helen stop saying don t it s ignorant it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime don t is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr bast well
p03060_A,03060,A,that s better well where shall i begin when i arrived at waterloo no i ll go back before that because i m anxious you should know everything from the first the first was about ten days ago it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can t help any more than we can you know at least i know in my own case when a man has said to me so and so s a pretty girl i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so and long to tweak her ear it s a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it but it wasn t only this in mr wilcox s case i gather now
p03061_A,03061,A,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years
p03062_A,03062,A,yes of that i m pretty sure indeed i began the moment he spoke to me
p03063_A,03063,A,i had but am wanting a long talk about it now what is it against him helen you must try and say
p03064_A,03064,A,but what has mr wilcox to do with paul
p03065_A,03065,A,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you
p03066_A,03066,A,i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me
p03067_A,03067,A,that s brutal mine is an absolutely different case i ve thought things out
p03068_A,03068,A,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p03069_A,03069,A,he only says reduced
p03070_A,03070,A,don t ever discuss political economy with henry it ll only end in a cry
p03071_A,03071,A,he is such a man in theory but oh helen in theory
p03072_A,03072,A,why should you put things so bitterly dearie
p03073_A,03073,A,oh helen am i will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that
p03074_A,03074,A,what is it oh what s wrong is tibby ill
p03075_A,03075,A,who why have you come
p03076_A,03076,A,oh helen whatever have you done now
p03077_A,03077,A,helen are you mad
p03078_A,03078,A,have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire helen
p03079_A,03079,A,don t be absurd they aren t starving and you know it now begin from the beginning i won t have such theatrical nonsense how dare you yes how dare you bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way my goodness but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy look servants people out of the windows they think it s some vulgar scandal and i must explain oh no it s only my sister screaming and only two hangers on of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason
p03080_A,03080,A,very well i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you ve brought them here or why you re here yourself
p03081_A,03081,A,yes to morrow
p03082_A,03082,A,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p03083_A,03083,A,and went into a bank instead
p03084_A,03084,A,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
p03085_A,03085,A,helen i like mr bast i agree that he s worth helping i agree that we are directly responsible
p03086_A,03086,A,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i ll do nothing no doubt you re right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry only i won t have it so choose if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them in my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice i have no use for justice if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves but he wants work and that we can t give him but possibly henry can
p03087_A,03087,A,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better
p03088_A,03088,A,oh my darling my darling forgive me
p03089_A,03089,A,i told you nothing that was true
p03090_A,03090,A,helen you wouldn t think i d invent that
p03091_A,03091,A,we thought it was illness but even then i haven t behaved worthily i ought not to have consulted any one what would our father have thought of me
p03092_A,03092,A,come away from those books helen do talk to me
p03093_A,03093,A,but why didn t you tell me dearest
p03094_A,03094,A,i believe you would never have told me
p03095_A,03095,A,i have not heard of monica
p03096_A,03096,A,you are very fond of her then
p03097_A,03097,A,helen you ve not forgiven me for my treachery you couldn t talk like this to me if you had
p03098_A,03098,A,series of mistakes
p03099_A,03099,A,no one
p03100_A,03100,A,the house is dead why worry on about it
p03101_A,03101,A,interested are you very well i must tell you i suppose my husband lent it on condition we but by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of look here i can t go on like this i warn you i won t helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry
p03102_A,03102,A,there s nothing to tell
p03103_A,03103,A,yes but i don t feel inclined to talk
p03104_A,03104,A,not that but i can t
p03105_A,03105,A,you mean that you want to go away from me
p03106_A,03106,A,certainly dearest
p03107_A,03107,A,how did this come henry would have done what he could
p03108_A,03108,A,surely you remember howards end
p03109_A,03109,A,miss avery was extraordinary she loved mrs wilcox and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty in consequence here are all the library books
p03110_A,03110,A,yes doesn t it
p03111_A,03111,A,curious too that the carpet fits
p03112_A,03112,A,you still have a mania for under furnishing would you care to come into the dining room before you start there s no carpet there
p03113_A,03113,A,look at the chairs though
p03114_A,03114,A,north west
p03115_A,03115,A,but why has miss avery made them set to partners i shall just
p03116_A,03116,A,try a drawing room chair
p03117_A,03117,A,helen what a memory you have for some things you re perfectly right it s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women men don t know what we want
p03118_A,03118,A,i don t agree in two thousand years they ll know look where tibby spilt the soup
p03119_A,03119,A,then you re right and it must have been soup i was thinking of much later that unsuccessful visit of aunt juley s when she didn t realise that tibby had grown up it was coffee then for he threw it down on purpose there was some rhyme tea coffee coffee tea that she said to him every morning at breakfast wait a minute how did it go
p03120_A,03120,A,but the rhyme was simply awful no decent person could put up with it
p03121_A,03121,A,i have got it that every morning for three weeks no wonder tibby was wild
p03122_A,03122,A,there i knew you d say that in the end of course he s a dear listen what s that
p03123_A,03123,A,what nonsense listen
p03124_A,03124,A,then take it back and say we require no milk no it s not the siege but possibly an attempt to provision us against one
p03125_A,03125,A,are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week well run away and do it again
p03126_A,03126,A,undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers
p03127_A,03127,A,i don t know
p03128_A,03128,A,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live
p03129_A,03129,A,meaning that i was dead i felt it
p03130_A,03130,A,what is it
p03131_A,03131,A,i don t think we could well do that
p03132_A,03132,A,i know but the house isn t supposed to be slept in and henry s suggestion was
p03133_A,03133,A,but helen my pet we can t without getting henry s leave of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate
p03134_A,03134,A,i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles
p03135_A,03135,A,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before
p03136_A,03136,A,which you change in a moment
p03137_A,03137,A,it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand
p03138_A,03138,A,i needn t say how much it would mean to me
p03139_A,03139,A,it is no good hesitating shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave
p03140_A,03140,A,we shan t consult him
p03141_A,03141,A,expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing
p03142_A,03142,A,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others
p03143_A,03143,A,looking back that was wrong of me
p03144_A,03144,A,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge
p03145_A,03145,A,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements
p03146_A,03146,A,oh good night miss avery
p03147_A,03147,A,why indeed
p03148_A,03148,A,we shall be that everywhere and for ever
p03149_A,03149,A,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home
p03150_A,03150,A,are you serious in asking me helen should i get on with your monica
p03151_A,03151,A,what was that
p03152_A,03152,A,i haven t the least notion
p03153_A,03153,A,that child is a wonderful nursemaid
p03154_A,03154,A,starting at the ages of six and one
p03155_A,03155,A,it may be a greater thing for baby
p03156_A,03156,A,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while
p03157_A,03157,A,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing
p03158_A,03158,A,dreadfully that is why i wish dolly had not come too to day still he wanted them all to come it has to be
p03159_A,03159,A,you d be odd if you didn t
p03160_A,03160,A,usen t
p03161_A,03161,A,and he likes you because you don t
p03162_A,03162,A,i do not agree i do not
p03163_A,03163,A,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p03164_A,03164,A,perhaps an adventure
p03165_A,03165,A,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet
p03166_A,03166,A,it will sweeten to morrow
p03167_A,03167,A,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter
p03168_A,03168,A,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me
p03169_A,03169,A,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own
p03170_A,03170,A,oh take care
p03171_A,03171,A,it was over at once
p03172_A,03172,A,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times
p03173_A,03173,A,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness
p03174_A,03174,A,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew
p03175_A,03175,A,everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think
p03176_A,03176,A,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that
p03177_A,03177,A,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes
p03178_A,03178,A,all right
p03179_A,03179,A,taken a what oh what s that do come in how do you do
p03180_A,03180,A,don t you talk meg you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat yes she did aunt juley it is a positive fact she thought it was a muff oh heavens i ve knocked the in and out card down where s frieda tibby why don t you ever no i can t remember what i was going to say that wasn t it but do tell the maids to hurry tea up what about this umbrella no it s all gone along the seams it s an appalling umbrella it must be mine
p03181_A,03181,A,whatever have i done
p03182_A,03182,A,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p03183_A,03183,A,better that he had
p03184_A,03184,A,all right auntie tibby
p03185_A,03185,A,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p03186_A,03186,A,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p03187_A,03187,A,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p03188_A,03188,A,if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go even at queen victoria s dinner party if something had been just a little different perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin
p03189_A,03189,A,fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin
p03190_A,03190,A,of course i don t mind it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there s nothing to be grave about at all
p03191_A,03191,A,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p03192_A,03192,A,if what
p03193_A,03193,A,really i shan t mind if paul points at our house and says there lives the girl who tried to catch me but she might
p03194_A,03194,A,well i am going away frieda s just asked me to stettin and i shan t be back till after the new year will that do or must i fly the country altogether really meg what has come over you to make such a fuss
p03195_A,03195,A,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p03196_A,03196,A,and there will even be some one for tibby there now tibby think of that frieda is saving up a little girl for you in pig tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries i ve talked too much my head aches now you talk
p03197_A,03197,A,i hope charles took the hint
p03198_A,03198,A,oh my dears what do you think you ll never guess a woman s been here asking me for her husband her what yes for her husband and it really is so
p03199_A,03199,A,i offered bracknell and he was rejected so was tibby cheer up tibby it s no one we know i said oh and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier
p03200_A,03200,A,lan or len we were not nice about our vowels lanoline
p03201_A,03201,A,of course a perfectly delightful experience oh mrs lanoline s a dear she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella she mislaid him saturday afternoon and for a long time suffered no inconvenience but all night and all this morning her apprehensions grew breakfast didn t seem the same no no more did lunch and so she strolled up to 2 wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article
p03202_A,03202,A,don t begin how on earthing she kept repeating not uncivilly but with extreme gloom in vain i asked her what she did know some knew what others knew and others didn t and then others again had better be careful oh dear she was incompetent she had a face like a silkworm and the dining room reeks of orris root we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands and i wondered where hers was too and advised her to go to the police she thanked me we agreed that mr lanoline s a notty notty man and hasn t no business to go on the lardy da but i think she suspected me up to the last bags i writing to aunt juley about this now meg remember bags i
p03203_A,03203,A,i don t think so she doesn t really mind the admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy
p03204_A,03204,A,oh no not likely no one capable of tragedy could have married mrs lanoline
p03205_A,03205,A,her figure may have been good once
p03206_A,03206,A,no it wasn t foolish you ve pushed back the boundaries i think it splendid of you
p03207_A,03207,A,though we have walked too
p03208_A,03208,A,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p03209_A,03209,A,doesn t matter
p03210_A,03210,A,i don t know
p03211_A,03211,A,as you like
p03212_A,03212,A,there s mrs lanoline too so dull
p03213_A,03213,A,i should like to know how he got hold of your card
p03214_A,03214,A,then did the card see the wife
p03215_A,03215,A,then what s the woof
p03216_A,03216,A,for tibby oxford
p03217_A,03217,A,for you
p03218_A,03218,A,why meg they re so much nicer generally i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it
p03219_A,03219,A,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p03220_A,03220,A,do you remember margaret
p03221_A,03221,A,and mine
p03222_A,03222,A,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p03223_A,03223,A,yes i know the darlings are regular sunbeams let me give you a plate
p03224_A,03224,A,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p03225_A,03225,A,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p03226_A,03226,A,yes he s gone some time
p03227_A,03227,A,yes it s all right meg poor poor creature
p03228_A,03228,A,oh i ve no patience with him i hate him poor dear mr bast he wanted to talk literature and we would talk business such a muddle of a man and yet so worth pulling through i like him extraordinarily
p03229_A,03229,A,no we have no real ties
p03230_A,03230,A,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p03231_A,03231,A,meg if you start in your honest english vein i shall throw the treacle at you
p03232_A,03232,A,it will be as easy as eating
p03233_A,03233,A,of course she s right
p03234_A,03234,A,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p03235_A,03235,A,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you
p03236_A,03236,A,tibby hurry up through i can t hold this gate indefinitely aunt juley i say aunt juley make the tea will you and frieda we ve got to talk houses and will come on afterwards
p03237_A,03237,A,don t don t don t meg don t don t don t do such a thing i tell you not to don t i know don t
p03238_A,03238,A,panic and emptiness don t
p03239_A,03239,A,it s not a thing like that
p03240_A,03240,A,but it s stupid
p03241_A,03241,A,all right i ll sit down if you ll sit down
p03242_A,03242,A,i do mean what i said don t it wouldn t do
p03243_A,03243,A,tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime
p03244_A,03244,A,then you love him
p03245_A,03245,A,but you will
p03246_A,03246,A,and have settled to marry him
p03247_A,03247,A,it is ever since paul
p03248_A,03248,A,but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger
p03249_A,03249,A,no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad
p03250_A,03250,A,and to me and to all women so one kissed paul
p03251_A,03251,A,one would lose something
p03252_A,03252,A,good morning mr wilcox
p03253_A,03253,A,oh mr wilcox about the porphyrion
p03254_A,03254,A,and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary
p03255_A,03255,A,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion i don t like those men they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow good it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr brits of today are in pain
p03256_A,03256,A,but oh meg what a theory
p03257_A,03257,A,yes there is a mystery i can t help it it s not my fault it s the way life has been made go on and marry him i think you re splendid and if any one can pull it off you will yes there is and i wasn t up to it with paul i can do only what s easy i can only entice and be enticed i can t and won t attempt difficult relations if i marry it will either be a man who s strong enough to boss me or whom i m strong enough to boss so i shan t ever marry for there aren t such men and heaven help any one whom i do marry for i shall certainly run away from him before you can say jack robinson there because i m uneducated but you you re different you re a heroine
p03258_A,03258,A,they re starving i found them starving
p03259_A,03259,A,the basts
p03260_A,03260,A,he has lost his place he has been turned out of his bank yes he s done for we upper classes have ruined him and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life starving his wife is ill starving she fainted in the train
p03261_A,03261,A,perhaps yes if you like i m mad but i ve brought them i ll stand injustice no longer i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves
p03262_A,03262,A,there was a restaurant car on the train
p03263_A,03263,A,kindly take back that word hangers on
p03264_A,03264,A,it s our last chance of seeing mr wilcox he s going to scotland i know he is i insist on seeing him
p03265_A,03265,A,i knew it was our last chance
p03266_A,03266,A,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p03267_A,03267,A,i brought them i did it all
p03268_A,03268,A,no indirectly via mr wilcox
p03269_A,03269,A,it s his duty to
p03270_A,03270,A,very well i promise you take it very calmly
p03271_A,03271,A,convenient you did not tell me that the books were unpacked i have found nearly everything that i want
p03272_A,03272,A,it has been a great surprise certainly has aunt juley been ill
p03273_A,03273,A,i suppose not but one loses faith in everything after this
p03274_A,03274,A,yes i am annoyed my wishes should have been respected i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary planning my life as i now have to do
p03275_A,03275,A,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard one can t go through a great deal of without planning one s actions in advance i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me i will go through them if necessary but only then in the second place i have no right to trouble people i cannot fit in with england as i know it i have done something that the english never pardon it would not be right for them to pardon it so i must live where i am not known
p03276_A,03276,A,yes i might have but decided to wait
p03277_A,03277,A,oh yes i should we have taken a flat in munich by we i mean myself and monica but for her i am and have been and always wish to be alone
p03278_A,03278,A,you wouldn t have she s an italian by birth at least she makes her living by journalism i met her originally on garda monica is much the best person to see me through
p03279_A,03279,A,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me you must not think that we shall never meet i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better but you haven t understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you this is a shock to you it isn t to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps such as this i cannot live in england
p03280_A,03280,A,oh meg dear why do we talk at all tell me how is it that all the books are down here
p03281_A,03281,A,who lives here then
p03282_A,03282,A,i suppose you are letting it though
p03283_A,03283,A,but i am interested you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life i am still helen i hope now this hasn t the feel of a dead house the hall seems more alive even than in the old days when it held the wilcoxes own things
p03284_A,03284,A,i don t hate him now i have stopped being a schoolgirl and meg once again i m not being unkind but as for fitting in with your english life no put it out of your head at once imagine a visit from me at ducie street it s unthinkable tell me about yourself
p03285_A,03285,A,but your marriage has been happy meg
p03286_A,03286,A,you feel as i do
p03287_A,03287,A,no more can i it is a nuisance but no good trying look here meg is the coast clear
p03288_A,03288,A,i suppose so dear old lady it isn t any use i knew we should have nothing to say give my love to aunt juley and tibby and take more yourself than i can say promise to come and see me in munich later
p03289_A,03289,A,for that is all we can do i am glad to have seen you and the things
p03290_A,03290,A,this is mr wilcox s house
p03291_A,03291,A,remember i who remember everything but it looks to be ours now
p03292_A,03292,A,not all the books she hasn t unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense and we never used to have the sword here
p03293_A,03293,A,where s the piano meg
p03294_A,03294,A,the carpet s a mistake i know that we had it in london but this floor ought to be bare it is far too beautiful
p03295_A,03295,A,oh what a place for mother s chiffonier
p03296_A,03296,A,oh look at them wickham place faced north didn t it
p03297_A,03297,A,anyhow it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun feel their dear little backs are quite warm
p03298_A,03298,A,over here meg put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn ye es the window s too high
p03299_A,03299,A,no i don t like the drawing room so much the beam has been match boarded it would have been so beautiful otherwise
p03300_A,03300,A,and never will
p03301_A,03301,A,coffee it was coffee surely impossible tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time
p03302_A,03302,A,i know no i don t what a detestable boy tibby was
p03303_A,03303,A,ah that greengage tree why do i connect it with dumb bells and there come the chickens the grass wants cutting i love yellow hammers
p03304_A,03304,A,tibby is moderately a dear now
p03305_A,03305,A,perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege
p03306_A,03306,A,it is always meg
p03307_A,03307,A,but i like milk why send it away
p03308_A,03308,A,you re a very good and rather a clever little boy mind you come again isn t he charming
p03309_A,03309,A,what do you mean
p03310_A,03310,A,because i probably agree with you
p03311_A,03311,A,i do agree but you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago
p03312_A,03312,A,yes the house has a surer life than we even if it was empty and as it is i can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture after all wickham place was a grave meg i ve a startling idea
p03313_A,03313,A,drink some milk to steady you no i won t tell you yet because you may laugh or be angry let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing then one would see really about my idea couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night
p03314_A,03314,A,here are beds tables towels
p03315_A,03315,A,i require no suggestions i shall not alter anything in my plans but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you it will be something to look back on oh meg lovey do let s
p03316_A,03316,A,ducie street is his house this is ours our furniture our sort of people coming to the door do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk why not it s a moon
p03317_A,03317,A,i know he won t like it but i am going to pass out of their lives what difference will it make in the long run if they say and she even spent the night at howards end
p03318_A,03318,A,because my plans
p03319_A,03319,A,then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home
p03320_A,03320,A,yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you
p03321_A,03321,A,then let us
p03322_A,03322,A,oh we don t want leave charles may say no
p03323_A,03323,A,go if you like i should have stopped without leave
p03324_A,03324,A,one isolates i isolated mr wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill consequently i was full of pity and almost of revenge for weeks i had blamed mr wilcox only and so when your letters came
p03325_A,03325,A,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts
p03326_A,03326,A,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul
p03327_A,03327,A,i did react until i found poor leonard i am steady now i shan t ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy yes i do at last understand
p03328_A,03328,A,because in death i agree
p03329_A,03329,A,why should miss avery work for us
p03330_A,03330,A,this is not quite our house yet when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists
p03331_A,03331,A,but affectionate tourists
p03332_A,03332,A,i can t pretend very long sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case unless you will come with me
p03333_A,03333,A,you would not but i am serious in asking you
p03334_A,03334,A,i haven t any idea do you suppose baby may meg
p03335_A,03335,A,tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay
p03336_A,03336,A,now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter will you be as careful as all that
p03337_A,03337,A,he is fond of baby that s why he does it they re going to be lifelong friends
p03338_A,03338,A,of course it will be a great thing for tom
p03339_A,03339,A,what a time they all are what can they be doing inside i wish henry was out to enjoy this this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house it s very hard
p03340_A,03340,A,meg is or isn t he ill i can t make out
p03341_A,03341,A,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle
p03342_A,03342,A,why does he want them meg may i tell you something i like henry
p03343_A,03343,A,i usen t to
p03344_A,03344,A,i like henry because he does worry
p03345_A,03345,A,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree
p03346_A,03346,A,baby s not to try and stand there s something wanting in me i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least but i is it some awful appalling criminal defect
p03347_A,03347,A,yes yes but what has leonard got out of life
p03348_A,03348,A,is that enough
p03349_A,03349,A,no only withered
p03350_A,03350,A,oh meg you are a person think of the racket and torture this time last year but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried what a change and all through you
p03351_A,03351,A,yes but who settled us down you you did it all sweetest though you re too stupid to see living here was your plan i wanted you he wanted you and everyone said it was impossible but you knew just think of our lives without you meg i and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie but you picked up the pieces and made us a home can t it strike you even for a moment that your life has been heroic can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest when you began to act and did all
p03352_A,03352,A,i hope it will be permanent
p03353_A,03353,A,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past
p03354_A,03354,A,do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst
p03355_A,03355,A,to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within
p03356_A,03356,A,whom is margaret talking to would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in
p03357_A,03357,A,you girls are so wonderful in always having oh dear one mustn t talk
p03358_A,03358,A,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p03359_A,03359,A,why he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well
p03360_A,03360,A,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p03361_A,03361,A,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p03362_A,03362,A,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p03363_A,03363,A,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p03364_A,03364,A,bournemouth is bournemouth is poole was and swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three now frau liesecke i have shown you bournemouth and i have shown you poole so let us walk backward a little and look down again at swanage
p03365_A,03365,A,oh dearest margaret i do hope she won t be overtired
p03366_A,03366,A,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p03367_A,03367,A,and to that charles oh helen helen what a time that was
p03368_A,03368,A,now look frau liesecke at my niece s train you see it is coming towards us coming coming and when it gets to corfe it will actually go through the downs on which we are standing so that if we walk over as i suggested and look down on swanage we shall see it coming on the other side shall we
p03369_A,03369,A,i had too much to do dear to look at it i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides it isn t likely i should remember much i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
p03370_A,03370,A,look stand where i stand and you will see the pony cart coming i see the pony cart coming
p03371_A,03371,A,on the what dear
p03372_A,03372,A,i do in a way remember the passage tibby but when every instrument is so beautiful it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another i am sure that you and helen take me to the very nicest concerts not a dull note from beginning to end i only wish that our german friends had stayed till it finished
p03373_A,03373,A,on the drum aunt juley
p03374_A,03374,A,who are the w s
p03375_A,03375,A,that house being the w s house i presume
p03376_A,03376,A,i hope you were pleased
p03377_A,03377,A,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p03378_A,03378,A,who s for lunch why such an early start
p03379_A,03379,A,so i surmise why
p03380_A,03380,A,such a message is easily given
p03381_A,03381,A,do you mind mrs martlett coming in or shall i take it from her at the door
p03382_A,03382,A,oh those people shall i lock the door again
p03383_A,03383,A,i gather he has had a mistress
p03384_A,03384,A,it is certainly a very bad business
p03385_A,03385,A,you see helen have a cigarette i don t see what i m to do
p03386_A,03386,A,do you want me to adjudicate that too had you not better consult an expert
p03387_A,03387,A,what is the sum
p03388_A,03388,A,good god alive
p03389_A,03389,A,i don t care an iota what people think but it s half what you have
p03390_A,03390,A,i i understand nobody
p03391_A,03391,A,oh yes
p03392_A,03392,A,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p03393_A,03393,A,a touch of the w s perhaps
p03394_A,03394,A,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p03395_A,03395,A,i was thinking of mr vyse he never strikes me as particularly happy
p03396_A,03396,A,but mr vyse is rather a wretched weedy man don t you think then there s guy that was a pitiful business besides every one is the better for some regular work i shall stick to it i am not saying it to educate you it is what i really think i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work and they must not starve it it s a new desire it goes with a great deal that s bad but in itself it s good and i hope that for women too not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago
p03397_A,03397,A,then we ll leave the subject till you do i m not going to rattle you round take your time only do think over the lives of the men you like most and see how they ve arranged them
p03398_A,03398,A,and don t think i m not serious because i don t use the traditional arguments making money a sphere awaiting you and so on all of which are for various reasons cant i m only your sister i haven t any authority over you and i don t want to have any just to put before you what i think the truth you see in a few years we shall be the same age practically and i shall want you to help me men are so much nicer than women
p03399_A,03399,A,i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance
p03400_A,03400,A,only ninnies
p03401_A,03401,A,they were men who had nothing better to do so take warning you must work or else you must pretend to work which is what i do work work work if you d save your soul and your body it is honestly a necessity dear boy look at the wilcoxes look at mr pembroke with all their defects of temper and understanding such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly
p03402_A,03402,A,i shall not they are the right sort
p03403_A,03403,A,well they re as near the right sort as you can imagine
p03404_A,03404,A,i can t bother over results they are too difficult for me i can only look at the men an empire bores me so far but i can appreciate the heroism that builds it up london bores me but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make london
p03405_A,03405,A,what it is worse luck i want activity without civilisation how paradoxical yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven
p03406_A,03406,A,if i m stupid get me back to the house hunting i ll even live in oxford if you like north oxford i ll live anywhere except bournemouth torquay and cheltenham oh yes or ilfracombe and swanage and tunbridge wells and surbiton and bedford there on no account
p03407_A,03407,A,there s nothing rash to do
p03408_A,03408,A,not exactly
p03409_A,03409,A,about helen
p03410_A,03410,A,he would do all he could but
p03411_A,03411,A,tibby love what next
p03412_A,03412,A,dear your judgment s often clearer than mine have you any notion what s at the back
p03413_A,03413,A,it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame
p03414_A,03414,A,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p03415_A,03415,A,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p03416_A,03416,A,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p03417_A,03417,A,it isn t of any consequence
p03418_A,03418,A,not at all
p03419_A,03419,A,oh not at all not at all
p03420_A,03420,A,it s a fine programme this afternoon is it not
p03421_A,03421,A,might i couldn t i
p03422_A,03422,A,thank you
p03423_A,03423,A,do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive
p03424_A,03424,A,but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive
p03425_A,03425,A,i i should have thought so kind of
p03426_A,03426,A,you wouldn t remember giving me this miss schlegel
p03427_A,03427,A,well that was how it happened you see
p03428_A,03428,A,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p03429_A,03429,A,yes thank you miss schlegel
p03430_A,03430,A,yes the mistake arose it was a mistake
p03431_A,03431,A,i don t call that fair i know what you mean and it isn t so
p03432_A,03432,A,it was something else i was somewhere else to what you think so there
p03433_A,03433,A,well i lost it entirely first of all the street lamps then the trees and towards morning it got cloudy
p03434_A,03434,A,i took the underground to wimbledon as i came out of the office i said to myself i must have a walk once in a way if i don t take this walk now i shall never take it i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon and then
p03435_A,03435,A,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p03436_A,03436,A,then you don t think i was foolish
p03437_A,03437,A,no i shall not it s better like this
p03438_A,03438,A,oh well enough
p03439_A,03439,A,it depends on what you call big
p03440_A,03440,A,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p03441_A,03441,A,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p03442_A,03442,A,wrong so to speak
p03443_A,03443,A,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p03444_A,03444,A,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p03445_A,03445,A,i ve got to be going
p03446_A,03446,A,there you hear that most unfair the gentleman says there not content with you can t deny it but as soon as i m useful it s a very different thing oh yes send for him cross question him pick his brains oh yes now take me on the whole i m a quiet fellow i m law abiding i don t wish any unpleasantness but i i
p03447_A,03447,A,i fail to see the connection
p03448_A,03448,A,that s right
p03449_A,03449,A,i hate all this
p03450_A,03450,A,jacky let s go we re more bother than we re worth we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us and they never will there s nothing we re good enough to do
p03451_A,03451,A,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p03452_A,03452,A,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p03453_A,03453,A,oh it s no good looking superior i mean what i say
p03454_A,03454,A,what s that
p03455_A,03455,A,ye es
p03456_A,03456,A,i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude
p03457_A,03457,A,i like guy and mr vyse most
p03458_A,03458,A,labouring under such a delusion why do you not marry
p03459_A,03459,A,has nobody arst you
p03460_A,03460,A,tell me about your ninnies then
p03461_A,03461,A,spare me the wilcoxes
p03462_A,03462,A,oh goodness me meg
p03463_A,03463,A,no no oh no
p03464_A,03464,A,what it is
p03465_A,03465,A,and i want civilisation without activity which i expect is what we shall find in the other place
p03466_A,03466,A,london then
p03467_A,03467,A,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p03468_A,03468,A,why don t you tell mr wilcox
p03469_A,03469,A,perhaps he has come across that sort of thing
p03470_A,03470,A,oh you know best but he is practical
p03471_A,03471,A,it is extraordinary
p03472_A,03472,A,none unless it s something mental
p03473_A,03473,A,margaret s point is this our sister may be mad
p03474_A,03474,A,it doesn t seem impossible to me it is surely a very tippy plan
p03475_A,03475,A,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p03476_A,03476,A,tibby love you must go
p03477_A,03477,A,my sister is so careless
p03478_A,03478,A,if you would give me your address
p03479_A,03479,A,that is where we live if you preferred you could call for the umbrella after the concert but i didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault
p03480_A,03480,A,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus
p03481_A,03481,A,we live quite near i am going there now could you walk round with me and we ll find your umbrella
p03482_A,03482,A,how tired one gets after music
p03483_A,03483,A,yes horribly
p03484_A,03484,A,do you go there much
p03485_A,03485,A,do you agree do you think music is so different from pictures
p03486_A,03486,A,so should i now my sister declares they re just the same we have great arguments over it she says i m dense i say she s sloppy now doesn t it seem absurd to you what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music it s very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process but what s gained i d like to know oh it s all rubbish radically false if monet s really debussy and debussy s really monet neither gentleman is worth his salt that s my opinion now this very symphony that we ve just been having she won t let it alone she labels it with meanings from start to finish turns it into literature i wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music yet i don t know there s my brother behind us he treats music as music and oh my goodness he makes me angrier than any one simply furious with him i daren t even argue but of course the real villain is wagner he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts i do feel that music is in a very serious state just now though extraordinarily interesting every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses like wagner who stir up all the wells of thought at once for a moment it s splendid such a splash as never was but afterwards such a lot of mud and the wells as it were they communicate with each other too easily now and not one of them will run quite clear that s what wagner s done
p03487_A,03487,A,no i can t say i do
p03488_A,03488,A,where did we meet mr bast for the minute i don t remember
p03489_A,03489,A,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p03490_A,03490,A,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p03491_A,03491,A,oh don t let us mind
p03492_A,03492,A,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p03493_A,03493,A,where did you start from do tell us more
p03494_A,03494,A,but not good country there is it
p03495_A,03495,A,yes you must do
p03496_A,03496,A,why better
p03497_A,03497,A,how do you like your work
p03498_A,03498,A,your company is the porphyrion isn t it
p03499_A,03499,A,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p03500_A,03500,A,i mean by big a solid well established concern that offers a reasonably good career to its employes
p03501_A,03501,A,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured
p03502_A,03502,A,oh good
p03503_A,03503,A,how so to speak
p03504_A,03504,A,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p03505_A,03505,A,so do i you were that last sunday you are this to day mr bast i and my sister have talked you over we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us we did not have you here out of charity which bores us but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives they have never entered into mine but into yours we thought haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some place some beloved place or tree we thought you one of these
p03506_A,03506,A,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p03507_A,03507,A,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p03508_A,03508,A,we would like to find you work we want to i like my sister you re only down in your luck go to the hotel have a good night s rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
p03509_A,03509,A,what what the pomp and circumstance will not be fine
p03510_A,03510,A,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p03511_A,03511,A,oh margaret you tiresome girl here have i been persuading herr liesecke to stop for pomp and circumstance and you are undoing all my work i am so anxious for him to hear what we are doing in music oh you musn t run down our english composers margaret
p03512_A,03512,A,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p03513_A,03513,A,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p03514_A,03514,A,come helen
p03515_A,03515,A,frieda you despise english music you know you do and english art and english literature except shakespeare and he s a german very well frieda you may go
p03516_A,03516,A,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p03517_A,03517,A,who are the wilcoxes
p03518_A,03518,A,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p03519_A,03519,A,i said my good mrs lanoline we have some grave misunderstanding here beautiful as i am my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty and never never has mr lanoline rested his eyes on mine
p03520_A,03520,A,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p03521_A,03521,A,i have come from oniton there has been a great deal of trouble there
p03522_A,03522,A,sunrise or something when i could get away
p03523_A,03523,A,i don t know what s to be done tibby i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place i stopped here to tell you this give meg my love and say that i want to be alone i mean to go to munich or else bonn
p03524_A,03524,A,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though my head is rather wretched i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in not there
p03525_A,03525,A,could i bathe my eyes tibby now for the explanation why didn t i begin with it i have found out something about mr wilcox he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people s lives it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do mrs bast
p03526_A,03526,A,no thanks tibbikins you re being very good to me i want to tell you the story before i go abroad you must do exactly what you like treat it as part of the furniture meg cannot have heard it yet i think but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself i don t even know whether she ought to be told knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match i simply don t know what to make of such a thing i trust your judgment what would you do
p03527_A,03527,A,and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself
p03528_A,03528,A,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion but you are right outside it and you must know in a day or two or perhaps a week take whatever steps you think fit i leave it in your hands the facts as they touch meg are all before you
p03529_A,03529,A,then there s nothing to be done i dare say you are right let them marry there remains the question of compensation
p03530_A,03530,A,this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this
p03531_A,03531,A,five thousand
p03532_A,03532,A,now what is the good of driblets to go through life having done one thing to have raised one person from the abyss not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets making the grey more grey no doubt people will think me extraordinary
p03533_A,03533,A,not nearly half i have far too much and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two it isn t enough i didn t expect you to understand me

p03577_A,03577,A,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p03578_A,03578,A,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p03579_A,03579,A,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini
p03580_A,03580,A,helen his mother has forgiven you
p03581_A,03581,A,most certainly her love has died
p03582_A,03582,A,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her
p03583_A,03583,A,i thought i did right to tell you
p03584_A,03584,A,yes i know thanks very much
p03585_A,03585,A,oh mrs wilcox i have made the baddest blunder i am more more ashamed and sorry than i can say i knew he was going to india in november but i forgot
p03586_A,03586,A,i knew i know i have been too absurd all through i am very much ashamed i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me
p03587_A,03587,A,she has just gone to germany
p03588_A,03588,A,you ve been worrying too how perfectly extraordinary i can see that you have you felt as i do helen mustn t meet him again
p03589_A,03589,A,now why
p03590_A,03590,A,it wasn t that your son still
p03591_A,03591,A,then what was it
p03592_A,03592,A,in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn t live together that s dreadfully probable i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another
p03593_A,03593,A,ah i have always been wanting to ask you how did you know helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things did paul tell you
p03594_A,03594,A,mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it
p03595_A,03595,A,but it s all right now
p03596_A,03596,A,you only think you aren t sure i do love these little muddles tidied up
p03597_A,03597,A,that s all right and i m sure too i must say good bye now you will be getting up
p03598_A,03598,A,i thought of you as one of the early risers
p03599_A,03599,A,nothing to get up for when there are all the autumn exhibitions and ysaye playing in the afternoon not to mention people
p03600_A,03600,A,a wedding
p03601_A,03601,A,are you quite certain that i m not interrupting mrs wilcox
p03602_A,03602,A,then i will stay i m enjoying this
p03603_A,03603,A,lucky people
p03604_A,03604,A,doesn t he care for travelling
p03605_A,03605,A,i suppose you have a garage there
p03606_A,03606,A,where s the pony gone
p03607_A,03607,A,the wych elm i remember helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree
p03608_A,03608,A,i should i love folklore and all festering superstitions
p03609_A,03609,A,of course it did it would cure anything once
p03610_A,03610,A,i m so glad
p03611_A,03611,A,i think of nothing else
p03612_A,03612,A,i m sure
p03613_A,03613,A,i m twenty nine that s not so wildly girlish what makes you say that do you mean that i have been gauche and rude
p03614_A,03614,A,oh i ve got it inexperience i m no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her
p03615_A,03615,A,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p03616_A,03616,A,people at stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses at least our cousins do but aren t particularly rich the town isn t interesting except for a clock that rolls its eyes and the view of the oder which truly is something special oh mrs wilcox you would love the oder the river or rather rivers there seem to be dozens of them are intense blue and the plain they run through an intensest green
p03617_A,03617,A,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p03618_A,03618,A,the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side
p03619_A,03619,A,you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs
p03620_A,03620,A,then you ought to discussion keeps a house alive it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone
p03621_A,03621,A,never mind us or her do say
p03622_A,03622,A,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p03623_A,03623,A,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p03624_A,03624,A,no we don t we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys mrs wilcox really we have something quiet and stable at the bottom we really have all my friends have don t pretend you enjoyed lunch for you loathed it but forgive me by coming again alone or by asking me to you
p03625_A,03625,A,first of all we must make a list and tick off the people s names my aunt always does and this fog may thicken up any moment have you any ideas
p03626_A,03626,A,because i ve odd ideas about christmas because i have all that money can buy i want more people but no more things
p03627_A,03627,A,if that is so if i have happened to be of use to you which i didn t know you cannot pay me back with anything tangible
p03628_A,03628,A,yes do you yes much easier no i do like christmas on the whole in its clumsy way it does approach peace and goodwill but oh it is clumsier every year
p03629_A,03629,A,we are usually in london and play the game with vigour carols at the abbey clumsy midday meal clumsy dinner for the maids followed by christmas tree and dancing of poor children with songs from helen the drawing room does very well for that we put the tree in the powder closet and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted and with the looking glass behind it looks quite pretty i wish we might have a powder closet in our next house of course the tree has to be very small and the presents don t hang on it no the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper
p03630_A,03630,A,yes in two or three years when the lease expires we must
p03631_A,03631,A,all our lives
p03632_A,03632,A,i suppose so we scarcely realise it yet my father
p03633_A,03633,A,i beg your pardon
p03634_A,03634,A,oh the lease have you been thinking of that all the time how very kind of you
p03635_A,03635,A,no values have risen too enormously they mean to pull down wickham place and build flats like yours
p03636_A,03636,A,landlords are horrible
p03637_A,03637,A,i howards end must be a very different house to ours we are fond of ours but there is nothing distinctive about it as you saw it is an ordinary london house we shall easily find another
p03638_A,03638,A,again my lack of experience i suppose i can t say anything when you take up that line mrs wilcox i wish i could see myself as you see me foreshortened into a backfisch quite the ingenue very charming wonderfully well read for my age but incapable
p03639_A,03639,A,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p03640_A,03640,A,not at all
p03641_A,03641,A,he was exceeding the speed limit i conclude he must expect to suffer with the lower animals i will come if i still may
p03642_A,03642,A,i shall never repent joining you
p03643_A,03643,A,he sailed on the 17th for nigeria in africa
p03644_A,03644,A,it doesn t matter miss schlegel it is good of you to have come round so promptly
p03645_A,03645,A,she gone as well yes certainly it is quite safe safe absolutely now
p03646_A,03646,A,i did think it best
p03647_A,03647,A,that s a most difficult question i think you put it best in your letter it was an instinct which may be wrong
p03648_A,03648,A,oh no he often my paul is very young you see
p03649_A,03649,A,an instinct which may be wrong
p03650_A,03650,A,these are indeed other words i had nothing so coherent in my head i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister
p03651_A,03651,A,there is nothing to be gained by discussing that
p03652_A,03652,A,i was certainly against taking mrs matheson s flat i knew it was opposite your house
p03653_A,03653,A,i think so
p03654_A,03654,A,oh yes i m sure i always sound uncertain over things it is my way of speaking
p03655_A,03655,A,no please stop a little longer i am taking a day in bed now and then i do
p03656_A,03656,A,at howards end yes there is nothing to get up for in london
p03657_A,03657,A,the truth is i am a little tired first came the wedding and then paul went off and instead of resting yesterday i paid a round of calls
p03658_A,03658,A,we took the flat chiefly on that account and also that paul could get his african outfit the flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s and she most kindly offered it to us so before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of dolly s people which we had not yet done fussell the father is in the indian army retired the brother is in the army the mother is dead charles and albert fussell have known one another some time they belong to the same club and are both devoted to golf dolly plays golf too though i believe not so well and they first met in a mixed foursome we all like her and are very much pleased they were married on the 11th a few days before paul sailed charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man so he made a great point of having it on the 11th the fussells would have preferred it after christmas but they were very nice about it there is dolly s photograph in that double frame
p03659_A,03659,A,yes quite
p03660_A,03660,A,they have gone to naples for their honeymoon
p03661_A,03661,A,i can hardly imagine charles in italy
p03662_A,03662,A,he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable his father gave him a car for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end
p03663_A,03663,A,yes my husband built a little one only last month to the west of the house not far from the wych elm in what used to be the paddock for the pony
p03664_A,03664,A,the pony oh dead ever so long ago
p03665_A,03665,A,oh it might interest you there are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk about four feet from the ground the country people put them in long ago and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark it will cure the toothache the teeth are almost grown over now and no one comes to the tree
p03666_A,03666,A,do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it
p03667_A,03667,A,certainly i remember cases you see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it i was born there good bye miss schlegel good bye thank you for coming you have cheered me up
p03668_A,03668,A,i i wonder whether you ever think about yourself
p03669_A,03669,A,i wonder i wondered at heidelberg
p03670_A,03670,A,i almost think you forget you re a girl
p03671_A,03671,A,i only meant that i am fifty one and that to me both of you read it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly
p03672_A,03672,A,yes you have got it inexperience is the word
p03673_A,03673,A,i hope that your sister is safe in germany by now
p03674_A,03674,A,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p03675_A,03675,A,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p03676_A,03676,A,i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side
p03677_A,03677,A,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p03678_A,03678,A,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p03679_A,03679,A,it cannot stand without them it cannot stand without them and i sometimes think but i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here
p03680_A,03680,A,are they i never follow any arguments i am only too thankful not to have a vote myself
p03681_A,03681,A,what an interesting life you all lead in london
p03682_A,03682,A,i am used to young people i hear a great deal of chatter at home for we like you entertain a great deal with us it is more sport and politics but i enjoyed my lunch very much miss schlegel dear and am not pretending and only wish i could have joined in more for one thing i m not particularly well just to day for another you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me charles is the same dolly the same but we are all in the same boat old and young i never forget that
p03683_A,03683,A,i thought we would go to harrods or the haymarket stores everything is sure to be there i am not a good shopper the din is so confusing and your aunt is quite right one ought to make a list take my notebook then and write your own name at the top of the page
p03684_A,03684,A,i should like to give you something worth your acquaintance miss schlegel in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight it has so happened that i have been left alone and you have stopped me from brooding i am too apt to brood
p03685_A,03685,A,i suppose not but one would like to perhaps i shall think of something as we go about we always give the servants money
p03686_A,03686,A,is it i am only used to country christmases
p03687_A,03687,A,you spoke of your next house miss schlegel then are you leaving wickham place
p03688_A,03688,A,have you been there long
p03689_A,03689,A,you will be very sorry to leave it
p03690_A,03690,A,but couldn t you get it renewed
p03691_A,03691,A,the lease i mean
p03692_A,03692,A,surely something could be done
p03693_A,03693,A,but how horrible
p03694_A,03694,A,it is monstrous miss schlegel it isn t right i had no idea that this was hanging over you i do pity you from the bottom of my heart to be parted from your house your father s house it oughtn t to be allowed it is worse than dying i would rather die than oh poor girls can what they call civilisation be right if people mayn t die in the room where they were born my dear i am so sorry howards end was nearly pulled down once it would have killed me
p03695_A,03695,A,so you think
p03696_A,03696,A,come down with me to howards end now i want you to see it you have never seen it i want to hear what you say about it for you do put things so wonderfully
p03697_A,03697,A,a thousand thanks miss schlegel for all your help
p03698_A,03698,A,well naturally he he isn t a road hog
p03699_A,03699,A,you are coming to sleep dear too it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful you are coming to stop i cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise these fogs never spread far i dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire and you will never repent joining them
p03700_A,03700,A,so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo
p03701_A,03701,A,they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously
p03702_A,03702,A,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p03703_A,03703,A,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p03704_A,03704,A,is anything gained by that
p03705_A,03705,A,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p03706_A,03706,A,i am not sure that i agree do you
p03707_A,03707,A,i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men
p03708_A,03708,A,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p03709_A,03709,A,i don t know i don t know

p03720_A,03720,A,oh henry dear here s a lovely surprise but let me introduce but i think you know miss schlegel
p03721_A,03721,A,fit as a fiddle
p03722_A,03722,A,miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
p03723_A,03723,A,henry why do people who have enough money try to get more money i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars a more inward light not so much for myself as for baby
p03724_A,03724,A,i was saying that this fool of a driver as the policeman himself admits
p03725_A,03725,A,another day mrs wilcox of course
p03726_A,03726,A,but as we ve insured against third party risks it won t so much matter
p03727_A,03727,A,thanks put it down
p03728_A,03728,A,yes thanks
p03729_A,03729,A,no i ll read it later
p03730_A,03730,A,i ve all i want
p03731_A,03731,A,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p03732_A,03732,A,no my girl of course not
p03733_A,03733,A,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p03734_A,03734,A,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p03735_A,03735,A,the post s come father
p03736_A,03736,A,has the breakfast been all right
p03737_A,03737,A,charles says do you want the times
p03738_A,03738,A,ring if you want anything father won t you
p03739_A,03739,A,mother couldn t have meant it
p03740_A,03740,A,mother believed so in ancestors too it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider who d never appreciate
p03741_A,03741,A,father s eaten nothing
p03742_A,03742,A,no indeed
p03743_A,03743,A,perhaps it may not be the rector s affair
p03744_A,03744,A,yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
p03745_A,03745,A,yes rather
p03746_A,03746,A,dolly go back at once my father s much annoyed with you charles come in at once to father he s had a letter that s too awful
p03747_A,03747,A,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p03748_A,03748,A,but i never dreamt of such a thing dad took me to call now and then and made me ask her to simpson s well i m altogether off dad
p03749_A,03749,A,he s going to read his letters first i think i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday
p03750_A,03750,A,i must make a note of that i am surprised that the rector allowed it
p03751_A,03751,A,whose else could it be
p03752_A,03752,A,another point i must speak to chalkeley
p03753_A,03753,A,it s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men he is responsible
p03754_A,03754,A,presumably she knows mother will have told her she got twice or three times into the nursing home presumably she is awaiting developments
p03755_A,03755,A,butter dolly
p03756_A,03756,A,what a horrid woman
p03757_A,03757,A,but those chrysanthemums
p03758_A,03758,A,good bye dad
p03759_A,03759,A,thank you evie dear charles
p03760_A,03760,A,i didn t know one could pollard elms i thought one only pollarded willows
p03761_A,03761,A,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p03762_A,03762,A,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p03763_A,03763,A,she wants howards end

p03766_A,03766,A,now charles you promised not to say those naughty
p03767_A,03767,A,i tell you i keep on telling you miss schlegel she s got it your mother s left it to her and you ve all got to move out
p03768_A,03768,A,why you just said it was
p03769_A,03769,A,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p03770_A,03770,A,you ve waked the baby i knew you would rum ti foo rackety tackety tompkin i m not responsible for what uncle percy does nor for anybody else or anything so there
p03771_A,03771,A,charles that reminds me of some poem
p03772_A,03772,A,i could simply scratch that woman s eyes out and to say it s my fault is most unfair
p03773_A,03773,A,i didn t
p03774_A,03774,A,tootle tootle playing on the pootle
p03775_A,03775,A,of course if you re going to be rude to uncle percy
p03776_A,03776,A,i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair you couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting could he diddums
p03777_A,03777,A,what for
p03778_A,03778,A,yes dear
p03779_A,03779,A,oh no one can pollard elms
p03780_A,03780,A,now dolly i can attend to you miss schlegel what does she want
p03781_A,03781,A,now mind you don t forget for i come little woman
p03782_A,03782,A,what s wrong
p03783_A,03783,A,got what what the dickens are you talking about
p03784_A,03784,A,look here i m in no mood for foolery it s no morning for it either
p03785_A,03785,A,howards end
p03786_A,03786,A,schlegels again
p03787_A,03787,A,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p03788_A,03788,A,my dear father consult an expert if you like but i don t admit it is my mother s writing
p03789_A,03789,A,who asked him while i was away who asked my sister down to meet him who sent them out in the motor day after day
p03790_A,03790,A,does it indeed we shall all be dancing to a very different music presently miss schlegel has fairly got us on toast
p03791_A,03791,A,it s your fault and five months ago you admitted it
p03792_A,03792,A,you did
p03793_A,03793,A,it s all very well to turn the conversation but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable but you must needs start match making besides cahill s too old
p03794_A,03794,A,miss schlegel always meant to get hold of howards end and thanks to you she s got it
p03795_A,03795,A,morning hullo my new car s been driven
p03796_A,03796,A,one minute i m busy well crane who s been driving it do you suppose
p03797_A,03797,A,wait dear wait a minute who had the key of the garage while you were away crane
p03798_A,03798,A,do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor
p03799_A,03799,A,then how do you account for the mud on the axle
p03800_A,03800,A,howards end now crane just don t forget to put on the stepney wheel
p03801_A,03801,A,has it sir
p03802_A,03802,A,the gardener sir
p03803_A,03803,A,no sir no one s had the motor out sir
p03804_A,03804,A,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p03805_A,03805,A,no sir
p03806_A,03806,A,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p03807_A,03807,A,come in all three of you dolly why have you disobeyed me
p03808_A,03808,A,give it her
p03809_A,03809,A,oh mr wilcox
p03810_A,03810,A,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p03811_A,03811,A,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p03812_A,03812,A,or coming down to the funeral at all
p03813_A,03813,A,i told you not to go out to the garage i ve heard you all shouting in the garden i won t have it come in into the dining room every one of you we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants here charles here read these see what you make
p03814_A,03814,A,certainly i was coming out to you when dolly
p03815_A,03815,A,come evie don t waste time sit down
p03816_A,03816,A,we know that it is not legally binding dolly we are aware of that legally i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire of course my dear we consider you as one of the family but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand
p03817_A,03817,A,i don t think that
p03818_A,03818,A,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p03819_A,03819,A,the whole thing is unlike her if miss schlegel had been poor if she had wanted a house i could understand it a little but she has a house of her own why should she want another she wouldn t have any use for howards end
p03820_A,03820,A,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p03821_A,03821,A,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p03822_A,03822,A,well let s sit down
p03823_A,03823,A,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p03824_A,03824,A,don t think what
p03825_A,03825,A,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p03826_A,03826,A,i wish she would i could then deal with her
p03827_A,03827,A,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p03828_A,03828,A,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out
p03829_A,03829,A,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p03830_A,03830,A,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p03831_A,03831,A,then why
p03832_A,03832,A,no inconvenience but i still don t understand i still don t understand when did you say you paid this call
p03833_A,03833,A,this afternoon call
p03834_A,03834,A,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p03835_A,03835,A,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p03836_A,03836,A,how far
p03837_A,03837,A,were you walking alone may i ask
p03838_A,03838,A,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p03839_A,03839,A,yes go on
p03840_A,03840,A,did you actually go off the roads
p03841_A,03841,A,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on
p03842_A,03842,A,yes but the wood this ere wood how did you get out of it
p03843_A,03843,A,but was the dawn wonderful
p03844_A,03844,A,just a grey evening turned upside down i know
p03845_A,03845,A,i should just think you ought
p03846_A,03846,A,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p03847_A,03847,A,heaven help us if we do
p03848_A,03848,A,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p03849_A,03849,A,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all
p03850_A,03850,A,oh yes
p03851_A,03851,A,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p03852_A,03852,A,oh really mr bast come and play with puppies
p03853_A,03853,A,come again
p03854_A,03854,A,i call that a very rude remark what do you want to turn on me like that for
p03855_A,03855,A,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p03856_A,03856,A,you have fainted perhaps the air will do you good
p03857_A,03857,A,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p03858_A,03858,A,it s work he wants can t you see
p03859_A,03859,A,mr wilcox is so illogical if we told him it was his duty to take you on he might refuse to do it the fact is he isn t properly educated i don t want to set you against him but you ll find him a trial
p03860_A,03860,A,i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that
p03861_A,03861,A,had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life
p03862_A,03862,A,oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle
p03863_A,03863,A,of course
p03864_A,03864,A,of course all presentable people say i
p03865_A,03865,A,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either
p03866_A,03866,A,mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired
p03867_A,03867,A,shall i sit up with her
p03868_A,03868,A,mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you
p03869_A,03869,A,because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common
p03870_A,03870,A,how long have you been married
p03871_A,03871,A,what did your people say
p03872_A,03872,A,my good boy what a mess who are your people and your grandparents
p03873_A,03873,A,so from which part
p03874_A,03874,A,from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast
p03875_A,03875,A,excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now
p03876_A,03876,A,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men
p03877_A,03877,A,settle down to what
p03878_A,03878,A,and that s to be life how can you with all the beautiful things to see and do with music with walking at night
p03879_A,03879,A,why not
p03880_A,03880,A,well you re wrong
p03881_A,03881,A,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i
p03882_A,03882,A,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever
p03883_A,03883,A,but not of the idea of death
p03884_A,03884,A,infinite difference
p03885_A,03885,A,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p03886_A,03886,A,that s so calling too a mistake
p03887_A,03887,A,i said to my wife i said to mrs bast and mrs bast said to me while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you
p03888_A,03888,A,call what call
p03889_A,03889,A,s saturday
p03890_A,03890,A,yes but i want i wanted have you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel it s a beautiful book i wanted to get back to the earth don t you see like richard does in the end or have you ever read stevenson s prince otto that s another beautiful book you get back to the earth in that i wanted i walked all the saturday night i walked
p03891_A,03891,A,oh i walked
p03892_A,03892,A,i don t know nor for how long it got too dark to see my watch
p03893_A,03893,A,yes but we d been talking it over at the office there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed
p03894_A,03894,A,it was gas lamps for hours still i had all the night and being out was the great thing i did get into woods too presently
p03895_A,03895,A,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark
p03896_A,03896,A,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p03897_A,03897,A,i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood that was awful with gorse bushes i did wish i d never come but suddenly it got light just while i seemed going under one tree then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london
p03898_A,03898,A,no the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention
p03899_A,03899,A,and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too i m glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say and besides you can believe me or not as you choose i was very hungry that dinner at wimbledon i meant it to last me all night like other dinners i never thought that walking would make such a difference why when you re walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines lord i did feel bad looking back it wasn t what you may call enjoyment it was more a case of sticking to it i did stick i i was determined oh hang it all what s the good i mean the good of living in a room for ever there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside if it s only nothing particular after all
p03900_A,03900,A,curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies
p03901_A,03901,A,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p03902_A,03902,A,no it is better not to risk a second interview i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life really i mean this we can never repeat it has done me real good and there we had better leave it
p03903_A,03903,A,things so often get spoiled
p03904_A,03904,A,the more a lady has to say the better
p03905_A,03905,A,ladies brighten
p03906_A,03906,A,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p03907_A,03907,A,i ve got to be going now
p03908_A,03908,A,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p03909_A,03909,A,what do you want to have me here for
p03910_A,03910,A,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p03911_A,03911,A,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all
p03912_A,03912,A,i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel
p03913_A,03913,A,i get no time for reading
p03914_A,03914,A,i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists
p03915_A,03915,A,may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i
p03916_A,03916,A,and your sister too
p03917_A,03917,A,but mr wilcox he is not perhaps
p03918_A,03918,A,quite so quite so
p03919_A,03919,A,it s better she stops in her room
p03920_A,03920,A,no thank you she does not need company
p03921_A,03921,A,no oh no miss schlegel no
p03922_A,03922,A,i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her
p03923_A,03923,A,nearly three years
p03924_A,03924,A,they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether
p03925_A,03925,A,they were just nothing at all agricultural labourers and that sort
p03926_A,03926,A,lincolnshire mostly but my mother s father he oddly enough came from these parts round here
p03927_A,03927,A,oh i don t know
p03928_A,03928,A,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not
p03929_A,03929,A,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking
p03930_A,03930,A,oh just settle down
p03931_A,03931,A,walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful
p03932_A,03932,A,because i see one must have money
p03933_A,03933,A,i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream
p03934_A,03934,A,i wonder
p03935_A,03935,A,i am as afraid of death as any one
p03936_A,03936,A,but what is the difference
p03937_A,03937,A,i must be stupid
p03938_A,03938,A,in the afternoon of course
p03939_A,03939,A,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p03940_A,03940,A,what s that card eh
p03941_A,03941,A,len who s miss schlegel
p03942_A,03942,A,hullo len what ho len
p03943_A,03943,A,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p03944_A,03944,A,well i know where you ve been but you don t know where i ve been
p03945_A,03945,A,i say jacky i m going out for a bit
p03946_A,03946,A,order order miss schlegel you are here i understand to advise me in the interests of the society for the preservation of places of historic interest or natural beauty i cannot have you speaking out of your role it makes my poor head go round and i think you forget that i am very ill
p03947_A,03947,A,have i i thought i had a million
p03948_A,03948,A,your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument why not give him the money itself you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year
p03949_A,03949,A,wasn t a million your capital dear me we ought to have settled that still it doesn t matter whatever you ve got i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each
p03950_A,03950,A,not if you gave them so much a big windfall would not pauperise a man it is these little driblets distributed among too many that do the harm money s educational it s far more educational than the things it buys in a sense well isn t the most civilized thing going the man who has learnt to wear his income properly give them a chance give them money don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies give them the wherewithal to buy these things when your socialism comes it may be different and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash till it comes give people cash for it is the warp of civilisation whatever the woof may be the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly for it s the the second most important thing in the world it is so slurred over and hushed up there is so little clear thinking oh political economy of course but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means money give mr bast money and don t bother about his ideals he ll pick up those for himself nothing but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world
p03951_A,03951,A,but that would be pauperising them
p03952_A,03952,A,how do you do i thought i recognised your voices whatever are you both doing down here
p03953_A,03953,A,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p03954_A,03954,A,yes quickness in argument time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t oh i believe in these discussions oh yes it doesn t much matter what subject you take
p03955_A,03955,A,this is between friends it ll be in the receiver s hands before christmas it ll smash
p03956_A,03956,A,will have let him leave the ship before it sinks let him get one now
p03957_A,03957,A,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p03958_A,03958,A,and how does he clean the boots
p03959_A,03959,A,there you are
p03960_A,03960,A,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p03961_A,03961,A,yes extremely
p03962_A,03962,A,it s let
p03963_A,03963,A,no it s let unfurnished we ve moved
p03964_A,03964,A,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled we only moved a week ago paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small endless drawbacks i forget whether you ve been up to it
p03965_A,03965,A,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales
p03966_A,03966,A,hilton isn t without us charles is there still
p03967_A,03967,A,yes but they moved eighteen months ago charles the good chap thought i should be lonely i didn t want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills he had a motor too there they all are a very jolly party he and she and the two grandchildren
p03968_A,03968,A,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to
p03969_A,03969,A,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other
p03970_A,03970,A,you too on the move
p03971_A,03971,A,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p03972_A,03972,A,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p03973_A,03973,A,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p03974_A,03974,A,oh i didn t mind oughtn t you really to be more careful
p03975_A,03975,A,i hardly consider that a fair deduction
p03976_A,03976,A,you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly you must keep that type at a distance otherwise they forget themselves sad but true they aren t our sort and one must face the fact
p03977_A,03977,A,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman
p03978_A,03978,A,what did he suspect you of
p03979_A,03979,A,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit
p03980_A,03980,A,i come back to my original point you ought to be more careful miss schlegel your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in
p03981_A,03981,A,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him
p03982_A,03982,A,oh he s one of that writer sort
p03983_A,03983,A,one minute you know nothing about him he probably has his own joys and interests wife children snug little home that s where we practical fellows are more tolerant than you intellectuals we live and let live and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs i quite grant i look at the faces of the clerks in my own office and observe them to be dull but i don t know what s going on beneath so by the way with london i have heard you rail against london miss schlegel and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you what do you know about london you only see civilisation from the outside i don t say in your case but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity discontent and socialism
p03984_A,03984,A,with you
p03985_A,03985,A,m m m m
p03986_A,03986,A,miss schlegel excuse me but i know the type
p03987_A,03987,A,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say
p03988_A,03988,A,surely he has some opinion
p03989_A,03989,A,i thought i d get round if i could evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table always secure a table first evie don t pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don t miss schlegel come in my side out of pity my goodness but you look tired been worrying round after your young clerks
p03990_A,03990,A,that s good what ll you have
p03991_A,03991,A,fish pie fancy coming for fish pie to simpson s it s not a bit the thing to go for here
p03992_A,03992,A,it s a golden rule to tip the carver tip everywhere s my motto
p03993_A,03993,A,then the fellows know one again especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year s end to year s end
p03994_A,03994,A,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately
p03995_A,03995,A,afraid i don t
p03996_A,03996,A,with pleasure
p03997_A,03997,A,a what
p03998_A,03998,A,funny experiences seem to come to you two girls no one s ever asked me about my what d ye call it perhaps i ve not got one
p03999_A,03999,A,tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that
p04000_A,04000,A,why s that gruyere or stilton
p04001_A,04001,A,better have stilton
p04002_A,04002,A,yet there may be something in it all the same
p04003_A,04003,A,so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it
p04004_A,04004,A,i don t know
p04005_A,04005,A,much the same as when you honoured it last week
p04006_A,04006,A,why of course
p04007_A,04007,A,let me think i wish i could help you but i thought you wanted to be in town one bit of advice fix your district then fix your price and then don t budge that s how i got both ducie street and oniton i said to myself i mean to be exactly here and i was and oniton s a place in a thousand
p04008_A,04008,A,i m out of my depth didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy
p04009_A,04009,A,yes i know and how much of it do you suppose he understood
p04010_A,04010,A,lower classes well you do admit that there are rich and poor that s something you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same the hard working man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom
p04011_A,04011,A,your socialists don t
p04012_A,04012,A,what have you come up determined not to deal
p04013_A,04013,A,not exactly in that case let s be starting
p04014_A,04014,A,come let s be starting how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane
p04015_A,04015,A,evie you won t see her she s gone out with cahill it s no fun i can tell you being left so much alone i ve got my work all day indeed a great deal too much of it but when i come home in the evening i tell you i can t stand the house
p04016_A,04016,A,you too feel lonely
p04017_A,04017,A,yes they are talking again but you were going to say
p04018_A,04018,A,your sister always likes her little joke
p04019_A,04019,A,you are not as unpractical as you pretend i shall never believe it at all events you responded to my telegram promptly
p04020_A,04020,A,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world
p04021_A,04021,A,i am glad very glad there is so much cant talked in would be intellectual circles i am glad you don t share it self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character but i can t stand those people who run down comforts they have usually some axe to grind can you
p04022_A,04022,A,i mean reasonable comforts of course i shouldn t like to think that you
p04023_A,04023,A,right the dining room now the entrance hall here we fellows smoke
p04024_A,04024,A,you do like it it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable isn t it

p04028_A,04028,A,miss schlegel i have had you up on false pretences i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house could you be induced to share my is it probable
p04029_A,04029,A,miss schlegel margaret you don t understand
p04030_A,04030,A,i am asking you to be my wife you aren t offended miss schlegel

p04035_A,04035,A,i don t know about that i shouldn t like to say
p04036_A,04036,A,by the way
p04037_A,04037,A,i was thinking if you didn t mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle
p04038_A,04038,A,with your brother
p04039_A,04039,A,oh very well
p04040_A,04040,A,about greece too

p04042_A,04042,A,what to do
p04043_A,04043,A,moderately but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady
p04044_A,04044,A,no hotels
p04045_A,04045,A,i wasn t aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again
p04046_A,04046,A,your sister and i have always hit it off but we re drifting away from our business let me begin at the beginning you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill
p04047_A,04047,A,exactly the girl s madly in love with him a very good sort of fellow but he demands and rightly a suitable provision with her and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development
p04048_A,04048,A,charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others
p04049_A,04049,A,yes money since you put it so frankly i am determined to be just to all just to you just to them i am determined that my children shall have me
p04050_A,04050,A,i am determined and have already written to charles to that effect
p04051_A,04051,A,my income
p04052_A,04052,A,i must say you re a downright young woman what a question to spring on a fellow
p04053_A,04053,A,the fact is my dear i hadn t any intention of bothering you with details i only wanted to let you know that well that something must be done for the others and you ve understood me perfectly so let s pass on to the next point
p04054_A,04054,A,we ve none too much i assure you you re marrying a poor man
p04055_A,04055,A,there s this other point and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters what s to be done now about the house in ducie street
p04056_A,04056,A,i say take care i don t report you to the police evie will probably be married in september we could scarcely think of anything before then
p04057_A,04057,A,how about september for us too
p04058_A,04058,A,heavens how you women do fly round my head s in a whirl point by point margaret howards end s impossible i let it to hamar bryce on a three years agreement last march don t you remember oniton well that is much much too far away to rely on entirely you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount but we must have a house within easy reach of town only ducie street has huge drawbacks there s a mews behind yes in summer especially the mews is a serious nuisance the smoking room too is an abominable little den the house opposite has been taken by operatic people ducie street s going down it s my private opinion
p04059_A,04059,A,shows things are moving good for trade
p04060_A,04060,A,high tide yes and these are the men to whom we give the vote however they have their own lives and interests let s get on a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone
p04061_A,04061,A,it isn t meant as a compliment my dear i just won t have you going about in the dark such people about too it s dangerous
p04062_A,04062,A,my motto is concentrate i ve no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing
p04063_A,04063,A,you re a clever little woman but my motto s concentrate
p04064_A,04064,A,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you
p04065_A,04065,A,not a bad business that porphyrion
p04066_A,04066,A,here s our hostess good morning mrs munt fine rhododendrons good morning frau liesecke we manage to grow flowers in england don t we
p04067_A,04067,A,when there is a sublet i find that damage
p04068_A,04068,A,a clerk who clears out of any concern good or bad without securing a berth somewhere else first is a fool and i ve no pity for him
p04069_A,04069,A,dempster why goodness me yes
p04070_A,04070,A,yes yes yes safe as houses safer
p04071_A,04071,A,if he sublets i shan t have the same control in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be things may be done for which no money can compensate for instance i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt it hangs margaret we must go and see the old place some time it s pretty in its way we ll motor down and have lunch with charles
p04072_A,04072,A,what about next wednesday
p04073_A,04073,A,but you can give that up now
p04074_A,04074,A,oh that ll be all right i ll speak to her

p04076_A,04076,A,you want to see the house though
p04077_A,04077,A,pigs teeth
p04078_A,04078,A,what a rum notion of course not
p04079_A,04079,A,what what s that do you mean that i m responsible
p04080_A,04080,A,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce
p04081_A,04081,A,they re all right they ll learn like the swallows and the telegraph wires
p04082_A,04082,A,kiss them now and come away
p04083_A,04083,A,what do you suppose
p04084_A,04084,A,we are
p04085_A,04085,A,that s no good it s locked who s got the key margaret you wait in the dry i ll go down for the key it isn t a hundred yards
p04086_A,04086,A,no i shall be back before i m gone
p04087_A,04087,A,it gave her quite a turn none of you girls have any nerves really of course a word from me put it all right but silly old miss avery she frightened you didn t she margaret there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds she might have said something instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on i passed her as i came in enough to make the car shy i believe miss avery goes in for being a character some old maids do it is their last resource heaven knows what she was doing in the place but that s bryce s business not mine
p04088_A,04088,A,she really did frighten you poor margaret and very naturally uneducated classes are so stupid
p04089_A,04089,A,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once
p04090_A,04090,A,i wish you d ask whether crane s ended
p04091_A,04091,A,it is so unlucky that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago then it had four five times the land thirty acres at least one could have made something out of it then a small park or at all events shrubberies and rebuilt the house farther away from the road what s the good of taking it in hand now nothing but the meadow left and even that was heavily mortgaged when i first had to do with things yes and the house too oh it was no joke mismanagement did it besides the days for small farms are over it doesn t pay except with intensive cultivation small holdings back to the land ah philanthropic bunkum take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale most of the land you see belongs to the people at the park they made their pile over copper good chaps avery s farm sishe s what they call the common where you see that ruined oak one after the other fell in and so did this as near as is no matter when i had more control i did what i could sold off the two and a half animals and the mangy pony and the superannuated tools pulled down the outhouses drained thinned out i don t know how many guelder roses and elder trees and inside the house i turned the old kitchen into a hall and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was garage and so on came later but one could still tell it s been an old farm and yet it isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew extraordinary who told you
p04092_A,04092,A,have you hurt yourself margaret
p04093_A,04093,A,i was afraid something had gone wrong
p04094_A,04094,A,one can t have ladies walking through the market square the fussells wouldn t like it they were awfully particular at charles s wedding my she our party was anxious to walk and certainly the church was just round the corner and i shouldn t have minded but the colonel made a great point of it
p04095_A,04095,A,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p04096_A,04096,A,the alexandrina isn t bad
p04097_A,04097,A,it s off curzon street
p04098_A,04098,A,they re callers it s too late for callers

p04104_A,04104,A,what are they out bean feasting
p04105_A,04105,A,why later on tell me now no time like the present
p04106_A,04106,A,if it isn t a long story
p04107_A,04107,A,what are his qualifications
p04108_A,04108,A,how old
p04109_A,04109,A,where was he before
p04110_A,04110,A,why did he leave

p04120_A,04120,A,no let me do that
p04121_A,04121,A,you put it with your usual delicacy
p04122_A,04122,A,i thought some one had got in
p04123_A,04123,A,is she to be shown up to your room
p04124_A,04124,A,far too much screaming there
p04125_A,04125,A,you re referring to last evening i have released you from your engagement i could find excuses but i won t no i won t a thousand times no i m a bad lot and must be left at that
p04126_A,04126,A,no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man
p04127_A,04127,A,cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference
p04128_A,04128,A,good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth
p04129_A,04129,A,i heard of none
p04130_A,04130,A,what to do
p04131_A,04131,A,it is no good those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started i have known cases of other men i despised them once i thought that i m different i shall never be tempted oh margaret we fellows all come to grief once in our time will you believe that there are moments when the strongest man that s true isn t it if you knew all you would excuse me i was far from good influences far even from england i was very very lonely and longed for a woman s voice that s enough i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now
p04132_A,04132,A,i have i have been through hell
p04133_A,04133,A,well let them go the man and his wife i mean for the more we see of your sister the better
p04134_A,04134,A,what did you say in the notes
p04135_A,04135,A,oh ah yes dear would you like one turn in the garden
p04136_A,04136,A,i am far from a saint in fact the reverse but you have taken me for better or worse bygones must be bygones you have promised to forgive me margaret a promise is a promise never mention that woman again
p04137_A,04137,A,practical you practical
p04138_A,04138,A,i didn t want to bother you besides i have only heard for certain this morning
p04139_A,04139,A,my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special
p04140_A,04140,A,i because why have we come to the tyrol if it comes to that one might go on asking such questions indefinitely the truth is i took oniton on account of evie don t let this go any further
p04141_A,04141,A,i shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged poor little girl she was so keen on it all and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting afraid it would get snapped up just like all of your sex well no harm s done she has had her country wedding and i ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school
p04142_A,04142,A,i have not yet decided what about norfolk it is now what nearly october let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring
p04143_A,04143,A,but my dear which would you rather have alterations or rheumatism
p04144_A,04144,A,just like helen
p04145_A,04145,A,she has never behaved like this before then
p04146_A,04146,A,well my dear how am i to know
p04147_A,04147,A,oh yes she and i have always hit it off together
p04148_A,04148,A,you want to get hold of her that s the problem isn t it she has got to see a doctor
p04149_A,04149,A,yes yes don t interrupt i ve got it it s perfectly easy leave it to me we ll send her down to howards end
p04150_A,04150,A,after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there
p04151_A,04151,A,of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time
p04152_A,04152,A,i see you have scruples
p04153_A,04153,A,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness
p04154_A,04154,A,you said just now
p04155_A,04155,A,margaret margaret no education can teach a woman logic now my dear my time is valuable do you want me to help you or not
p04156_A,04156,A,she was bound to drive there will be her books
p04157_A,04157,A,you re not fit for it let me go alone i know exactly what to do
p04158_A,04158,A,don t you want to tidy yourself
p04159_A,04159,A,i still consider you are not fit for it
p04160_A,04160,A,i was meaning to act for the best
p04161_A,04161,A,certainly dear girl are you all right now
p04162_A,04162,A,is the truant all right
p04163_A,04163,A,margaret you look upset you might have given me a knock with the gate
p04164_A,04164,A,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen
p04165_A,04165,A,manage what
p04166_A,04166,A,come this is an odd beginning
p04167_A,04167,A,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door
p04168_A,04168,A,quite so
p04169_A,04169,A,margaret margaret
p04170_A,04170,A,is it what we feared
p04171_A,04171,A,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring
p04172_A,04172,A,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you
p04173_A,04173,A,would she not tell you
p04174_A,04174,A,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you
p04175_A,04175,A,as you like
p04176_A,04176,A,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us
p04177_A,04177,A,i thought it best to ring up charles
p04178_A,04178,A,he has at once gone to call on your brother
p04179_A,04179,A,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name
p04180_A,04180,A,if possible yes
p04181_A,04181,A,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life
p04182_A,04182,A,certainly my dear
p04183_A,04183,A,well possibly she is right
p04184_A,04184,A,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel
p04185_A,04185,A,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact
p04186_A,04186,A,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold
p04187_A,04187,A,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps
p04188_A,04188,A,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too
p04189_A,04189,A,that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles
p04190_A,04190,A,margaret my margaret
p04191_A,04191,A,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles
p04192_A,04192,A,my dear you are forgetting yourself
p04193_A,04193,A,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did
p04194_A,04194,A,as i have actually been forgiven
p04195_A,04195,A,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once
p04196_A,04196,A,i beg your pardon
p04197_A,04197,A,you have not been yourself all day
p04198_A,04198,A,the two cases are different
p04199_A,04199,A,i prefer to discuss things with you outside
p04200_A,04200,A,what about
p04201_A,04201,A,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down
p04202_A,04202,A,i have something to tell you
p04203_A,04203,A,where are you going
p04204_A,04204,A,have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be
p04205_A,04205,A,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i
p04206_A,04206,A,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son
p04207_A,04207,A,dear me helen listen to that and he ll have to get another place
p04208_A,04208,A,why s that
p04209_A,04209,A,not well
p04210_A,04210,A,then do you really advise us to tell this youth
p04211_A,04211,A,and how s howards end looking
p04212_A,04212,A,really and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea how strange are the ways of fate
p04213_A,04213,A,why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever evie never told me
p04214_A,04214,A,as far as the house never
p04215_A,04215,A,what a change i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you
p04216_A,04216,A,still but i thought he was still at epsom they were furnishing that christmas one christmas how everything alters i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often wasn t it epsom
p04217_A,04217,A,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family
p04218_A,04218,A,no but none of you are there
p04219_A,04219,A,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either
p04220_A,04220,A,next september
p04221_A,04221,A,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p04222_A,04222,A,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p04223_A,04223,A,this is the young man whom we were to warn against the porphyrion we warn him and look
p04224_A,04224,A,obviously unfair i was only thinking how tangled things are it s our fault mostly neither yours nor his
p04225_A,04225,A,ye es
p04226_A,04226,A,i admit it willingly a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself
p04227_A,04227,A,of wanting to make money out of him
p04228_A,04228,A,exactly how indeed just horrible corroding suspicion one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes
p04229_A,04229,A,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again
p04230_A,04230,A,i do firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out secondly he cares for something special in adventure it is quickest to call that special something poetry
p04231_A,04231,A,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both
p04232_A,04232,A,his wife is an old bore he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us
p04233_A,04233,A,naughty when you re married miss wilcox won t you want outside interests
p04234_A,04234,A,miss wilcox he was
p04235_A,04235,A,he said so and about such a thing he wouldn t lie that s where i differ from you men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort
p04236_A,04236,A,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man
p04237_A,04237,A,i forget
p04238_A,04238,A,yes pretty well but i wonder what helen s doing
p04239_A,04239,A,no after houses i m hungry not tired i want to eat heaps
p04240_A,04240,A,fish pie
p04241_A,04241,A,go for something for me then
p04242_A,04242,A,perhaps it does make life more human
p04243_A,04243,A,have you been in the east
p04244_A,04244,A,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses
p04245_A,04245,A,well what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them
p04246_A,04246,A,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s
p04247_A,04247,A,no you d hate it it s all proteids and body buildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura
p04248_A,04248,A,never heard of an aura oh happy happy man i scrub at mine for hours nor of an astral plane just so luckily it was helen s aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went
p04249_A,04249,A,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it
p04250_A,04250,A,too difficult a question
p04251_A,04251,A,gruyere please
p04252_A,04252,A,stilton because though i don t believe in auras and think theosophy s only a halfway house
p04253_A,04253,A,not even that it may be halfway in the wrong direction i can t explain i don t believe in all these fads and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them
p04254_A,04254,A,i could indeed i will when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny but why do you want this settled
p04255_A,04255,A,now mr wilcox you do know how s your house
p04256_A,04256,A,i don t mean ducie street howards end of course
p04257_A,04257,A,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us we re nearly demented
p04258_A,04258,A,but i do budge gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses cow them with an eye and up they come trembling ladies can t it s the houses that are mesmerising me i ve no control over the saucy things houses are alive no
p04259_A,04259,A,did i i mean i did more or less i talk the same way to every one or try to
p04260_A,04260,A,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice
p04261_A,04261,A,every one admits that
p04262_A,04262,A,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily
p04263_A,04263,A,this is awfully kind of you but i m afraid it s not going to do the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family
p04264_A,04264,A,not exactly
p04265_A,04265,A,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane
p04266_A,04266,A,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things
p04267_A,04267,A,in my absurd way i m lonely too it s heart breaking to leave one s old home i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there helen says
p04268_A,04268,A,horribly hullo parliament s back
p04269_A,04269,A,only some rubbish about furniture helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas just imagine it rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them
p04270_A,04270,A,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you
p04271_A,04271,A,oh even i know a good thing when i see it
p04272_A,04272,A,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that
p04273_A,04273,A,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends
p04274_A,04274,A,i want to go over the whole house as soon as i get back to swanage which will be to morrow afternoon i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby and wire you yes or no
p04275_A,04275,A,oh jolly
p04276_A,04276,A,ye es semi rubbish are those cruikshanks
p04277_A,04277,A,does all this furniture come from howards end
p04278_A,04278,A,does however i m concerned with the house not the furniture how big is this smoking room
p04279_A,04279,A,ah well mr wilcox aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses
p04280_A,04280,A,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may
p04281_A,04281,A,oh yes indeed yes
p04282_A,04282,A,how could i be offended good bye you will have a letter from me i am going back to swanage to morrow
p04283_A,04283,A,good bye and it s you i thank
p04284_A,04284,A,that would be most kind
p04285_A,04285,A,not at all
p04286_A,04286,A,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago
p04287_A,04287,A,i little thought then certainly did you
p04288_A,04288,A,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal
p04289_A,04289,A,a suggestion a seed
p04290_A,04290,A,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby
p04291_A,04291,A,yes during cigarettes
p04292_A,04292,A,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably
p04293_A,04293,A,greece was a very good card henry tibby s only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little well done
p04294_A,04294,A,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon
p04295_A,04295,A,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery
p04296_A,04296,A,why not
p04297_A,04297,A,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs
p04298_A,04298,A,do before you go i am so anxious you two should be friends
p04299_A,04299,A,dolly s uncle
p04300_A,04300,A,poor fellow
p04301_A,04301,A,of course not you mean money how stupid i am of course not
p04302_A,04302,A,be generous to them bother justice
p04303_A,04303,A,how much have you a year i ve six hundred
p04304_A,04304,A,yes we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles justice and even generosity depend on that
p04305_A,04305,A,that s all right don t tell me i don t want to know i can do the sum just as well by proportion divide your income into ten parts how many parts would you give to evie how many to charles how many to paul
p04306_A,04306,A,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one
p04307_A,04307,A,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world
p04308_A,04308,A,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me
p04309_A,04309,A,the earlier the nicer henry females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer
p04310_A,04310,A,right shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it that s rather an idea they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management look here yes we ll do that and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire
p04311_A,04311,A,how sad it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses
p04312_A,04312,A,i hate this continual flux of london it is an epitome of us at our worst eternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming away streaming streaming for ever that s why i dread it so i mistrust rivers even in scenery now the sea
p04313_A,04313,A,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment
p04314_A,04314,A,can t i look after myself i do wish

p04321_A,04321,A,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p04322_A,04322,A,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right

p04357_A,04357,A,shall i

p04363_A,04363,A,i should be glad if you took him but i don t know whether he s qualified
p04364_A,04364,A,no of course of course
p04365_A,04365,A,i can promise you he s the last he he s rather a special case
p04366_A,04366,A,she s overtired
p04367_A,04367,A,is she
p04368_A,04368,A,henry i am awfully sorry
p04369_A,04369,A,to have brought this down on you
p04370_A,04370,A,i don t know what it is all about let s come in
p04371_A,04371,A,this is helen s plan not mine
p04372_A,04372,A,so that woman has been your mistress
p04373_A,04373,A,when please
p04374_A,04374,A,i have asked helen to sleep she is best here so don t lock the front door
p04375_A,04375,A,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him i don t know about later but now the basts must clearly go
p04376_A,04376,A,i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed will you tell the servants about helen could some one go to carry her bag you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear
p04377_A,04377,A,henry dear henry dear look at me no i won t have you shirking look at me there that s all
p04378_A,04378,A,leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference
p04379_A,04379,A,it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess
p04380_A,04380,A,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast
p04381_A,04381,A,didn t she send me a message or anything
p04382_A,04382,A,would you ring the bell please
p04383_A,04383,A,why to inquire i ll go thank you
p04384_A,04384,A,yes that s enough dear
p04385_A,04385,A,i have already forgiven you henry
p04386_A,04386,A,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means
p04387_A,04387,A,i told you last night
p04388_A,04388,A,yes yes henry
p04389_A,04389,A,except for some practical reason never
p04390_A,04390,A,yes i m practical
p04391_A,04391,A,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp
p04392_A,04392,A,why did you go there then
p04393_A,04393,A,certainly not
p04394_A,04394,A,where shall we live then henry i should enjoy living somewhere
p04395_A,04395,A,if possible something permanent i can t be as young as i was for these alterations don t suit me
p04396_A,04396,A,i see your point if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys only in the spring let us look before we leap i will take warning by evie and not hurry you remember that you have a free hand this time these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive
p04397_A,04397,A,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p04398_A,04398,A,of course not
p04399_A,04399,A,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely
p04400_A,04400,A,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean
p04401_A,04401,A,for all i know she has seen one already
p04402_A,04402,A,how will you do that
p04403_A,04403,A,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me
p04404_A,04404,A,no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t
p04405_A,04405,A,i suppose so
p04406_A,04406,A,i deny it s madness
p04407_A,04407,A,it s madness when i say it but not when you say it
p04408_A,04408,A,not in that way
p04409_A,04409,A,i cannot make it out
p04410_A,04410,A,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off
p04411_A,04411,A,have i time
p04412_A,04412,A,perhaps i was not at lunch but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now
p04413_A,04413,A,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so
p04414_A,04414,A,look my hands have stopped trembling
p04415_A,04415,A,go away
p04416_A,04416,A,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all
p04417_A,04417,A,stop that at least
p04418_A,04418,A,you could but you have not you are therefore not qualified to attend my sister
p04419_A,04419,A,forgive me but i will not
p04420_A,04420,A,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
p04421_A,04421,A,well henry send your doctor away what possible use is he now it all turns on affection now affection don t you see surely you see i like helen very much you not so much mr mansbridge doesn t know her that s all and affection when reciprocated gives rights put that down in your note book mr mansbridge it s a useful formula you don t know what you want yourselves for one sensible remark i will let you in but you cannot make it you would trouble my sister for no reason i will not permit it i ll stand here all the day sooner
p04422_A,04422,A,it is
p04423_A,04423,A,no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end
p04424_A,04424,A,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name
p04425_A,04425,A,i never even asked her who seduced her
p04426_A,04426,A,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills
p04427_A,04427,A,have you anything else to ask me henry
p04428_A,04428,A,who is we
p04429_A,04429,A,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain
p04430_A,04430,A,that too was unnecessary
p04431_A,04431,A,are we to make her seducer marry her
p04432_A,04432,A,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases
p04433_A,04433,A,may i ask you my question now
p04434_A,04434,A,to morrow helen goes to munich
p04435_A,04435,A,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end
p04436_A,04436,A,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending
p04437_A,04437,A,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it
p04438_A,04438,A,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to
p04439_A,04439,A,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow
p04440_A,04440,A,she cannot be left alone
p04441_A,04441,A,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him
p04442_A,04442,A,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all
p04443_A,04443,A,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property
p04444_A,04444,A,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking
p04445_A,04445,A,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough
p04446_A,04446,A,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question
p04447_A,04447,A,you have mentioned mrs wilcox
p04448_A,04448,A,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast
p04449_A,04449,A,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done
p04450_A,04450,A,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry
p04451_A,04451,A,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p04452_A,04452,A,i am going to germany with my sister i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home our talk last night was more important than you have realised i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you
p04453_A,04453,A,certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass here are your keys
p04454_A,04454,A,i don t want to hear it my sister is going to be ill my life is going to be with her now we must manage to build up something she and i and her child
p04455_A,04455,A,munich we start after the inquest if she is not too ill
p04456_A,04456,A,yes heart disease
p04457_A,04457,A,good bye
p04458_A,04458,A,could you tell me henry what was that about mrs wilcox having left me howards end
p04459_A,04459,A,you didn t darling nothing has been done wrong
p04460_A,04460,A,i beg your pardon
p04461_A,04461,A,some one s got to go england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices unless we get firm in west africa ger untold complications may follow now tell me all your news
p04462_A,04462,A,what in
p04463_A,04463,A,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p04464_A,04464,A,every one moving good bye
p04465_A,04465,A,here we are good morning helen
p04466_A,04466,A,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p04467_A,04467,A,no the fellow needn t
p04468_A,04468,A,you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen
p04469_A,04469,A,i am grieved for your clerk but it is all in the day s work it s part of the battle of life
p04470_A,04470,A,oh come come you re not to blame no one s to blame
p04471_A,04471,A,i wouldn t say that but you re taking it far too seriously who is this fellow
p04472_A,04472,A,now a word of advice
p04473_A,04473,A,a word of advice don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor see that she doesn t margaret the poor are poor and one s sorry for them but there it is as civilisation moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary it s just the shoe pinching no one can help it and it might easily have been worse by all means subscribe to charities subscribe to them largely but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social question except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be point me out a time when men have been equal
p04474_A,04474,A,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier no no you can t there always have been rich and poor i m no fatalist heaven forbid but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces and there always will be rich and poor you can t deny it and you can t deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward
p04475_A,04475,A,here they are at last
p04476_A,04476,A,isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible
p04477_A,04477,A,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p04478_A,04478,A,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p04479_A,04479,A,but mr wilcox do first light another cigarette it s this we ve just come across a young fellow who s evidently very poor and who seems interest
p04480_A,04480,A,oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chance but he is so poor he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink well he got mixed up in our debate he wasn t the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man how should he be helped should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret s plan most of them thought this would pauperise him should he and those like him be given free libraries i said no he doesn t want more books to read but to read books rightly my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too nothing seemed quite right now what do you think imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor what would you do
p04481_A,04481,A,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p04482_A,04482,A,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p04483_A,04483,A,human nature i suppose
p04484_A,04484,A,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p04485_A,04485,A,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p04486_A,04486,A,but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad and would smash before christmas
p04487_A,04487,A,in other words mr bast need never have left it
p04488_A,04488,A,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p04489_A,04489,A,is that your point a man who had little money has less that s mine
p04490_A,04490,A,a man who had little money has less owing to us under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression
p04491_A,04491,A,is no one to blame for anything
p04492_A,04492,A,we have told you about the fellow twice already you have even met the fellow he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile he is capable of better things we we the upper classes thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge and here s the result
p04493_A,04493,A,i require no more advice
p04494_A,04494,A,i didn t say
p04495_A,04495,A,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p04496_A,04496,A,we brought the little fellows round
p04497_A,04497,A,miss schlegel you are too kind
p04498_A,04498,A,he has apparently got them
p04499_A,04499,A,i am really concerned at the way those girls go on they are as clever as you make em but unpractical god bless me one of these days they ll go too far girls like that oughtn t to live alone in london until they marry they ought to have some one to look after them we must look in more often we re better than no one you like them don t you evie
p04500_A,04500,A,evie i like that miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
p04501_A,04501,A,very well does my arrangement suit you evie
p04502_A,04502,A,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p04503_A,04503,A,i bred em myself
p04504_A,04504,A,but play with puppies a little first
p04505_A,04505,A,this is ahab that s jezebel
p04506_A,04506,A,i don t want your patronage i don t want your tea i was quite happy what do you want to unsettle me for i put it to this gentleman i ask you sir am i to have my brain picked
p04507_A,04507,A,i m connected with a leading insurance company sir i receive what i take to be an invitation from these ladies i come and it s to have my brain picked i ask you is it fair
p04508_A,04508,A,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p04509_A,04509,A,are we intruding miss schlegel can we be of any use or shall we go
p04510_A,04510,A,highly unfair
p04511_A,04511,A,oh yes
p04512_A,04512,A,yes he hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed he needs outside interests
p04513_A,04513,A,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that
p04514_A,04514,A,he laughs if i remember correctly
p04515_A,04515,A,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p04516_A,04516,A,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me

p04536_A,04536,A,an aquarium oh meesis munt you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt why then victor my brother in law collected many tadpoles

p04542_A,04542,A,yes so do i but oh dear dear how dreadful it all seems and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement you and frieda and meg and mrs wilcox all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul
p04543_A,04543,A,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that
p04544_A,04544,A,i hope that my wife how do you do will give you a decent lunch i left instructions but we live in a rough and ready way she expects you back to tea too after you have had a look at howards end i wonder what you ll think of the place i wouldn t touch it with tongs myself do sit down it s a measly little place

p04563_A,04563,A,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p04564_A,04564,A,you ll see it at its worst for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him i never saw such a disgraceful mess it s unbelievable he wasn t in the house a month
p04565_A,04565,A,yes i flung them down
p04566_A,04566,A,the keys are at the farm we wouldn t have the keys

p04568_A,04568,A,the whole house is at sixes and sevens we don t want any more mess
p04569_A,04569,A,i am sure i beg your pardon i appear always to be intruding
p04570_A,04570,A,don t ask me
p04571_A,04571,A,i don t know where she is pater dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her
p04572_A,04572,A,i ll sit up for her as late as you like but she can hardly be coming isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel
p04573_A,04573,A,can i do anything for you sir
p04574_A,04574,A,then at eight to morrow i may go up in the car
p04575_A,04575,A,it has been pretty horrible they were there and they had the man up there with them too
p04576_A,04576,A,i told you last night his name was bast
p04577_A,04577,A,i know pater that was what i felt as a matter of fact there is no need to trouble about the man he was in the last stages of heart disease and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off the police are seeing about it at this moment i got up there oh it couldn t have been more than half past seven the avery woman was lighting a fire for them they were still upstairs i waited in the drawing room we were all moderately civil and collected though i had my suspicions i gave them your message and mrs wilcox said in that way of hers
p04578_A,04578,A,i promised to tell you with her love that she was going to germany with her sister this evening that was all we had time for because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding for suddenly mrs wilcox screamed out his name i recognised it and i went for him in the hall was i right pater i thought things were going a little too far
p04579_A,04579,A,he caught hold of the bookcase which came down over him so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden we all thought he was shamming however he s dead right enough awful business
p04580_A,04580,A,a sword of theirs
p04581_A,04581,A,well didn t you see pater i had to snatch up the first thing handy i hadn t a riding whip or stick i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword
p04582_A,04582,A,he pulled over the bookcase as i said and fell
p04583_A,04583,A,that or a fit however we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics
p04584_A,04584,A,very well sir which car will you have
p04585_A,04585,A,it s a good half mile the sun s very hot for april shan t i take you up and then perhaps a little spin round by tewin
p04586_A,04586,A,oh all right i m about the house if you want me for anything i thought of not going up to the office to day if that is your wish
p04587_A,04587,A,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down
p04588_A,04588,A,i ve sent a telegram after him and a pretty sharp one too he and he in person is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years
p04589_A,04589,A,quite right
p04590_A,04590,A,now charles what s happened
p04591_A,04591,A,answer my question plain question plain answer do
p04592_A,04592,A,why charles
p04593_A,04593,A,who s we my boy pray who s we
p04594_A,04594,A,i can t have this sort of behaviour my boy margaret s too sweet natured to mind but i mind for her is anything wrong with you charles this afternoon
p04595_A,04595,A,tell me when she comes in
p04596_A,04596,A,perhaps perhaps
p04597_A,04597,A,i don t want you to conclude that my wife and i had anything of the nature of a quarrel she was only overwrought as who would not be i shall do what i can for helen but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once do you see that is a sine qua non
p04598_A,04598,A,eight or earlier say that you are acting as my representative and of course use no violence charles
p04599_A,04599,A,what what man
p04600_A,04600,A,my god is it possible in your mother s house charles in your mother s house
p04601_A,04601,A,nothing else
p04602_A,04602,A,right my dear boy i don t know but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t then did he just just crumple up as you said
p04603_A,04603,A,sword what sword whose sword
p04604_A,04604,A,what were you doing with it
p04605_A,04605,A,then what
p04606_A,04606,A,but the real cause was heart disease of that you re sure
p04607_A,04607,A,i think i ll walk
p04608_A,04608,A,you go on as if i didn t know my own mind you young fellows one idea is to get into a motor i tell you i want to walk i m very fond of walking
p04609_A,04609,A,it is indeed my boy
p04610_A,04610,A,oh well i took you for ruth wilcox
p04611_A,04611,A,yes mrs wilcox of course
p04612_A,04612,A,well come right in mrs wilcox
p04613_A,04613,A,come right into the hall first
p04614_A,04614,A,the house has been empty long enough
p04615_A,04615,A,mrs wilcox it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years the house is mrs wilcox s and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer
p04616_A,04616,A,mistake upon mistake mistake upon mistake
p04617_A,04617,A,yes it should be a merry house enough
p04618_A,04618,A,there is still the parlour and the dining room then through here i ve not finished here yet there s still a deal to do the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs for there is no need to go into expense at hilton
p04619_A,04619,A,oh indeed on account of his hay fever
p04620_A,04620,A,you think that you won t come back to live here mrs wilcox but you will
p04621_A,04621,A,some day tcha tcha don t talk about some day you are living here now
p04622_A,04622,A,you are living here and have been for the last ten minutes if you ask me the nursery
p04623_A,04623,A,yes the maidy s well enough for those that is who don t suffer from sneezing i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time oh they ought to do this they mustn t do that he d learn them to be lads and just then the tickling took him he has it from his father with other things there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth
p04624_A,04624,A,this house lies too much on the land for them naturally they were glad enough to slip in at first but wilcoxes are better than nothing as i see you ve found they keep a place going don t they yes it is just that
p04625_A,04625,A,ay they breed like rabbits well well it s a funny world but he who made it knows what he wants in it i suppose if mrs charlie is expecting her fourth it isn t for us to repine
p04626_A,04626,A,no better n nothing i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died but we stayed civil it was a very civil family old mrs howard never spoke against anybody nor let any one be turned away without food then it was never trespassers will be prosecuted in their land but would people please not come in mrs howard was never created to run a farm
p04627_A,04627,A,things went on until there were no men
p04628_A,04628,A,i suppose so but ruth should have married a no disrespect to you to say this for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way whether she got him first or no
p04629_A,04629,A,a soldier some real soldier but that s all over a better time is coming now though you ve kept me long enough waiting in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening have you ordered in coals
p04630_A,04630,A,good night mrs wilcox
p04631_A,04631,A,no one ever told the lad he ll have a child
p04632_A,04632,A,i mrs wilcox i
p04633_A,04633,A,your niece and i have come together
p04634_A,04634,A,miss avery i have come about the furniture could you kindly let me in
p04635_A,04635,A,thank you so much
p04636_A,04636,A,i m afraid this isn t what we meant mr wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched for instance these books are my brother s we are storing them for him and for my sister who is abroad when you kindly undertook to look after things we never expected you to do so much
p04637_A,04637,A,i dare say we didn t explain it has been a mistake and very likely our mistake
p04638_A,04638,A,yes mrs wilcox s house the mother of mr charles
p04639_A,04639,A,well i don t know i really don t know what s to be done
p04640_A,04640,A,i don t know i dare say well thank you very much miss avery yes that s all right delightful
p04641_A,04641,A,it is all a mistake a misunderstanding mr wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end
p04642_A,04642,A,we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex and part of this furniture my part will go down there presently
p04643_A,04643,A,that remains to be seen we have no intention of doing so for the present we happen to need a much larger house circumstances oblige us to give big parties of course some day one never knows does one
p04644_A,04644,A,am i
p04645_A,04645,A,it s a beautiful meadow
p04646_A,04646,A,my brother gets hay fever too
p04647_A,04647,A,they keep england going it is my opinion
p04648_A,04648,A,they breed and they also work it certainly is a funny world but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it i think it ll never be a bad one never really bad
p04649_A,04649,A,had they no men to help them
p04650_A,04650,A,until mr wilcox came along
p04651_A,04651,A,whom should she have married
p04652_A,04652,A,we are not coming no not coming never coming it has all been a mistake the furniture must be repacked at once and i am very sorry but i am making other arrangements and must ask you to give me the keys
p04653_A,04653,A,i wasn t as foolish as you suggest she only startled me for the house had been silent so long
p04654_A,04654,A,i shouldn t have disliked it perhaps
p04655_A,04655,A,why dolly here s a surprise how are the boys and the baby
p04656_A,04656,A,it will be very jolly
p04657_A,04657,A,of course not
p04658_A,04658,A,they have only just arrived here is the ground floor no that s rather difficult try the elevation we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky line
p04659_A,04659,A,i suppose the paper
p04660_A,04660,A,just the ordinary way up that s the sky line and the part that smells strongest is the sky
p04661_A,04661,A,quite well
p04662_A,04662,A,so it is helen is odd awfully she has now been away eight months
p04663_A,04663,A,a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address do write her a line i will look it up for you
p04664_A,04664,A,exactly she left just after evie s wedding it would be eight months
p04665_A,04665,A,just so
p04666_A,04666,A,why has she done that how unnecessary
p04667_A,04667,A,i gave no such orders perhaps she was airing the things she did undertake to light an occasional fire
p04668_A,04668,A,books dolly are you serious has she been touching our books
p04669_A,04669,A,i am very much obliged to you dolly what can have come over miss avery i must go down about it at once some of the books are my brother s and are quite valuable she had no right to open any of the cases
p04670_A,04670,A,i hadn t heard of that
p04671_A,04671,A,but it was wrong of evie to return it it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing
p04672_A,04672,A,why does that make any difference dolly
p04673_A,04673,A,you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married
p04674_A,04674,A,but miss avery said
p04675_A,04675,A,did she give any reasons
p04676_A,04676,A,she s rather old for that may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother
p04677_A,04677,A,i wonder then why he let me ask her to look after the house
p04678_A,04678,A,did you take her for a spook
p04679_A,04679,A,have you heard the news charles is so ang i mean he is sure you know about it or rather that you don t know
p04680_A,04680,A,but lucky you with four courts of your own at midhurst
p04681_A,04681,A,are those the plans does it matter my seeing them
p04682_A,04682,A,charles has never seen the plans
p04683_A,04683,A,what makes it smell so funny
p04684_A,04684,A,and which way up is it
p04685_A,04685,A,well ask me another margaret oh what was i going to say how s helen
p04686_A,04686,A,is she never coming back to england every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t
p04687_A,04687,A,but hasn t she any address
p04688_A,04688,A,no don t bother that s eight months she has been away surely
p04689_A,04689,A,just when baby was born then
p04690_A,04690,A,oh yes that is it miss avery has been unpacking your packing cases
p04691_A,04691,A,ask another i suppose you ordered her to
p04692_A,04692,A,it was far more than an air the floor sounds covered with books charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don t know
p04693_A,04693,A,hasn t she though what used to be the hall s full of them charles thought for certain you knew of it
p04694_A,04694,A,i say she s dotty she was the one that never got married you know oh i say perhaps she thinks your books are wedding presents to herself old maids are taken that way sometimes miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie
p04695_A,04695,A,didn t you know she gave evie a present last august and evie returned it and then oh goloshes you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote
p04696_A,04696,A,but the present was so expensive
p04697_A,04697,A,still when it costs over five pounds i didn t see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman now can you
p04698_A,04698,A,oh mine was old earthenware stuff not worth a halfpenny evie s was quite different you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do evie didn t want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble
p04699_A,04699,A,it was a perfectly awful letter charles said it was the letter of a madman in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond
p04700_A,04700,A,we think she meant to be invited to oniton and so climb into society
p04701_A,04701,A,that s a notion give every one their due eh well i suppose i ought to be toddling come along mr muff you want a new coat but i don t know who ll give it you i m sure oh yes
p04702_A,04702,A,or miss avery giving me a wedding present but charles said i must try not to mind because she had known his grandmother
p04703_A,04703,A,i meant great grandmother the one who left mrs wilcox the house weren t both of them and miss avery friends when howards end too was a farm then hadn t mrs wilcox a brother or was it an uncle anyhow he popped the question and miss avery she said no just imagine if she d said yes she would have been charles s aunt oh i say that s rather good charlie s aunt i must chaff him about that this evening and the man went out and was killed yes i m certain i ve got it right now tom howard he was the last of them
p04704_A,04704,A,i say howards end howards ended i m rather on the spot this evening eh
p04705_A,04705,A,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p04706_A,04706,A,yes mr wilcox i see
p04707_A,04707,A,but the diddums can t listen he isn t nine months old
p04708_A,04708,A,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p04709_A,04709,A,as usual you ve got the story wrong my good dorothea
p04710_A,04710,A,i believe so

p04814_A,04814,A,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it s no good my settling down here it s not really the country and it s not the town
p04815_A,04815,A,so long father
p04816_A,04816,A,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included

p04820_A,04820,A,see for yourself
p04821_A,04821,A,there are no cads in italy he is the son of a dentist why not
p04822_A,04822,A,indeed philip you surprise me i understood you went in for equality and so on
p04823_A,04823,A,well we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear mrs herriton but it is true he is a younger branch of course families ramify just as in yours there is your cousin joseph gino s father is courtesy itself and rising rapidly in his profession this very month he leaves monteriano and sets up at poggibonsi and for my own poor part i think what people are is what matters but i don t suppose you ll agree and i should like you to know that gino s uncle is a priest the same as a clergyman at home well his cousin s a lawyer at rome
p04824_A,04824,A,why a lawyer just like you are except that he has lots to do and can never get away
p04825_A,04825,A,caroline why blame her what s all this to do with caroline
p04826_A,04826,A,i can t break it off now
p04827_A,04827,A,for once in my life i ll thank you to leave me alone i ll thank your mother too for twelve years you ve trained me and tortured me and i ll stand it no more do you think i m a fool do you think i never felt ah when i came to your house a poor young bride how you all looked me over never a kind word and discussed me and thought i might just do and your mother corrected me and your sister snubbed me and you said funny things about me to show how clever you were and when charles died i was still to run in strings for the honour of your beastly family and i was to be cooped up at sawston and learn to keep house and all my chances spoilt of marrying again no thank you no thank you bully insolent boy who s that pray but you but thank goodness i can stand up against the world now for i ve found gino and this time i marry for love
p04828_A,04828,A,tell him so now have it out with him gino gino come in avanti fra filippo forbids the banns fra filippo s blood s up he shrinks from nothing oh take care he doesn t hurt you
p04829_A,04829,A,remember that it is only by going off the track that you get to know the country see the little towns gubbio pienza cortona san gemignano monteriano and don t let me beg you go with that awful tourist idea that italy s only a museum of antiquities and art love and understand the italians for the people are more marvellous than the land
p04830_A,04830,A,i wish i were
p04831_A,04831,A,my dear lilia don t let s have a scene before i arrived i thought i might have to question you it is unnecessary i know everything miss abbott has told me a certain amount and the rest i see for myself
p04832_A,04832,A,that he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad
p04833_A,04833,A,thank you for the information i know everything as i told you before i am also aware of the social position of an italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town
p04834_A,04834,A,and i understood that signor carella was a member of the italian nobility
p04835_A,04835,A,what kind of lawyer
p04836_A,04836,A,the whole thing is like a bad dream so bad that it cannot go on if there was one redeeming feature about the man i might be uneasy as it is i can trust to time for the moment lilia he has taken you in but you will find him out soon it is not possible that you a lady accustomed to ladies and gentlemen will tolerate a man whose position is well not equal to the son of the servants dentist in coronation place i am not blaming you now but i blame the glamour of italy i have felt it myself you know and i greatly blame miss abbott
p04837_A,04837,A,because we expected her to so i am confident and you in your heart agree that this engagement will not last think of your life at home think of irma and i ll also say think of us for you know lilia that we count you more than a relation i should feel i was losing my own sister if you did this and my mother would lose a daughter
p04838_A,04838,A,poor lilia i know it may be painful but i have come to rescue you and book worm though i may be i am not frightened to stand up to a bully he s merely an insolent boy he thinks he can keep you to your word by threats he will be different when he sees he has a man to deal with
p04839_A,04839,A,good bye dear every one what a whirl good bye darling mind you re always good and do what granny tells you
p04840_A,04840,A,i ll do my best
p04841_A,04841,A,and granny when will the old ship get to italy
p04842_A,04842,A,aunt harriet uncle phil grandmamma what do you suppose my little brother is doing now has he begun to play do italian babies talk sooner than us or would he be an english baby born abroad oh i do long to see him and be the first to teach him the ten commandments and the catechism
p04843_A,04843,A,she is sure to be good
p04844_A,04844,A,caroline my caroline jump in or your chaperon will go off without you
p04845_A,04845,A,handkerchiefs and collars in my inlaid box i ve lent you my inlaid box
p04846_A,04846,A,good bye mrs charles may you enjoy yourself and may god bless you
p04847_A,04847,A,oh i am so sorry but you do look so funny oh you all look so funny waving oh pray
p04848_A,04848,A,high spirits to begin so long a journey
p04849_A,04849,A,i wish that mrs charles had gotten the footwarmer these london porters won t take heed to a country chap
p04850_A,04850,A,but you did your best and i think it simply noble of you to have brought mrs theobald all the way here on such a day as this
p04851_A,04851,A,come with me dear and i will tell you now it is time for you to know
p04852_A,04852,A,here beginneth the new life
p04853_A,04853,A,and alas alas a look of old mrs theobald what appalling apparition was that i did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile why ever did she come
p04854_A,04854,A,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells
p04855_A,04855,A,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public
p04856_A,04856,A,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch
p04857_A,04857,A,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there
p04858_A,04858,A,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her
p04859_A,04859,A,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe
p04860_A,04860,A,one moment irma i m going to the station i ll give you the pleasure of my company
p04861_A,04861,A,of course we must tell irma
p04862_A,04862,A,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now
p04863_A,04863,A,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby
p04864_A,04864,A,the child must know some time
p04865_A,04865,A,i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it
p04866_A,04866,A,it will make a difference in the money surely
p04867_A,04867,A,good does the italian get anything
p04868_A,04868,A,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott
p04869_A,04869,A,she was so mixed up in the affair
p04870_A,04870,A,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off
p04871_A,04871,A,that is quite true
p04872_A,04872,A,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean
p04873_A,04873,A,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks
p04874_A,04874,A,what did you say
p04875_A,04875,A,and what happened this morning
p04876_A,04876,A,did you let her
p04877_A,04877,A,my dear sister i can reassure you firstly the beastly baby is italian secondly it was promptly christened at santa deodata s and a powerful combination of saints watch over
p04878_A,04878,A,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up
p04879_A,04879,A,hopeful indeed
p04880_A,04880,A,she might do it too
p04881_A,04881,A,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment
p04882_A,04882,A,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p04883_A,04883,A,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it
p04884_A,04884,A,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to
p04885_A,04885,A,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott
p04886_A,04886,A,you talk like harriet
p04887_A,04887,A,certainly he will never suppose that
p04888_A,04888,A,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father
p04889_A,04889,A,she fences well
p04890_A,04890,A,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano
p04891_A,04891,A,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price
p04892_A,04892,A,go where do sit down what s happened
p04893_A,04893,A,i won t i ve been and i ve failed i ll never see the place again i hate italy
p04894_A,04894,A,then let her go let her mess with italy by herself she ll come to grief somehow italy s too dangerous too
p04895_A,04895,A,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world
p04896_A,04896,A,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her
p04897_A,04897,A,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way
p04898_A,04898,A,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her
p04899_A,04899,A,when a man is neither well bred nor well connected nor handsome nor clever nor rich even lilia may discard him in time
p04900_A,04900,A,my dear boy if possible she has got worse and worse it was your idea of italian travel that saved us
p04901_A,04901,A,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera
p04902_A,04902,A,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it
p04903_A,04903,A,the man may be a duke or he may be an organ grinder that is not the point if lilia marries him she insults the memory of charles she insults irma she insults us therefore i forbid her and if she disobeys we have done with her for ever
p04904_A,04904,A,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage
p04905_A,04905,A,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her
p04906_A,04906,A,mrs theobald must be told but she doesn t count she is breaking up very quickly she doesn t even see mr kingcroft now he thank goodness i hear has at last consoled himself with someone else
p04907_A,04907,A,the later the better every moment she is developing
p04908_A,04908,A,on irma why
p04909_A,04909,A,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours
p04910_A,04910,A,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians
p04911_A,04911,A,he will get all hers but you know what that is
p04912_A,04912,A,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline
p04913_A,04913,A,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them
p04914_A,04914,A,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men
p04915_A,04915,A,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed
p04916_A,04916,A,really irma is getting too tiresome she forgot poor lilia soon enough
p04917_A,04917,A,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers
p04918_A,04918,A,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it
p04919_A,04919,A,she asked if she could pray for her new father for the italian
p04920_A,04920,A,i got up without saying anything
p04921_A,04921,A,i cannot think what his motive is in sending them
p04922_A,04922,A,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her
p04923_A,04923,A,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one
p04924_A,04924,A,i told her not to but we must watch her carefully without of course appearing to be suspicious
p04925_A,04925,A,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities
p04926_A,04926,A,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain
p04927_A,04927,A,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it
p04928_A,04928,A,what do you think of it it would not do to let him know that we are anxious for it
p04929_A,04929,A,but what effect will the letter have on him
p04930_A,04930,A,dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out
p04931_A,04931,A,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed
p04932_A,04932,A,isn t it disheartening
p04933_A,04933,A,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go
p04934_A,04934,A,she won t accept won t accept the letter as final you must go to monteriano
p04935_A,04935,A,yes going alone would start this evening i offered to write she said it was too late too late the child if you please irma s brother to live with her to be brought up by her and her father at our very gates to go to school like a gentleman she paying oh you re a man it doesn t matter for you you can laugh but i know what people say and that woman goes to italy this evening
p04936_A,04936,A,stop that nonsense philip i will not be disgraced by her i will have the child pay all we ve got for it i will have it
p04937_A,04937,A,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable
p04938_A,04938,A,there is santa deodata one of the most beautiful churches in italy
p04939_A,04939,A,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them
p04940_A,04940,A,you must have felt just as you did when i wanted to pray for the devil
p04941_A,04941,A,no harriet he is too vulgar
p04942_A,04942,A,did mother explain it all to you
p04943_A,04943,A,absurd nonsense they talk about the heat supposing we were here for pleasure what could be more pleasurable than this
p04944_A,04944,A,singles or returns
p04945_A,04945,A,sweet creature how helpful you will be when we come to signor carella
p04946_A,04946,A,then what have you come for pray for ornament
p04947_A,04947,A,oh thanks
p04948_A,04948,A,mother told you did she
p04949_A,04949,A,there is a caffe a prison a theatre a church walls a view
p04950_A,04950,A,nobody asked you miss you see now lilia was asked by such a nice young gentleman with curls all over his forehead and teeth just as white as father makes them but harriet do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place nothing at all
p04951_A,04951,A,i know it is but it s old awfully old
p04952_A,04952,A,oh i m perfectly right but at the same time i don t know so many things have happened here people have lived so hard and so splendidly i can t explain
p04953_A,04953,A,first harriet i shall settle you at the stella d italia in the comfort that befits your sex and disposition then i shall make myself some tea after tea i shall take a book into santa deodata s and read there it is always fresh and cool
p04954_A,04954,A,harriet i am hot to whom do you refer
p04955_A,04955,A,tut tut tutlet you d find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient i heartily dislike the fellow but we know he didn t murder her in that letter though she said a lot she never said he was physically cruel
p04956_A,04956,A,things which one must mention if one s to talk at all and things which one must keep in their proper place because he was unfaithful to his wife it doesn t follow that in every way he s absolutely vile
p04957_A,04957,A,oh stow it take it to the back kitchen it s no more a supreme test than anything else the italians never were chivalrous from the first if you condemn him for that you ll condemn the whole lot
p04958_A,04958,A,and the french as well
p04959_A,04959,A,things aren t so jolly easy
p04960_A,04960,A,go where
p04961_A,04961,A,i m damned if i ll go i want my tea
p04962_A,04962,A,harriet don t act or act better
p04963_A,04963,A,think of mother and don t straddle across the stairs let the cabman and the landlady come down and let me go up and choose rooms
p04964_A,04964,A,harriet are you mad
p04965_A,04965,A,we shall probably be arrested for brawling harriet have you the very slightest sense of the ludicrous
p04966_A,04966,A,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby
p04967_A,04967,A,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man
p04968_A,04968,A,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre
p04969_A,04969,A,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous
p04970_A,04970,A,but this is an opera lucia di lammermoor sir walter scott classical you know
p04971_A,04971,A,shut it
p04972_A,04972,A,why it is the famous hot lady of the apennines the one who had never never before
p04973_A,04973,A,you mustn t accuse her of that though she is exasperating she hasn t come here to betray us
p04974_A,04974,A,i ve not got the baby harriet but at the same time i haven t exactly failed i and signor carella are to have another interview this afternoon at the caffe garibaldi he is perfectly reasonable and pleasant should you be disposed to come with me you would find him quite willing to discuss things he is desperately in want of money and has no prospect of getting any i discovered that at the same time he has a certain affection for the child miss abbott has behaved extraordinarily but at the same time harriet you must listen my dear you must stop crying i have something quite important to say
p04975_A,04975,A,remember that miss abbott has done us no harm she said nothing to him about the matter he assumes that she is working with us i gathered that
p04976_A,04976,A,yes but if you re careful she may be i interpret her behaviour thus she went to see him honestly intending to get the child away in the note she left me she says so and i don t believe she d lie
p04977_A,04977,A,when she got there there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism before very long if i know anything about psychology there will be a reaction she ll be swept back
p04978_A,04978,A,if you want to carry off the baby keep your peace with miss abbott for if she chooses she can help you better than i can
p04979_A,04979,A,did you
p04980_A,04980,A,into santa deodata s
p04981_A,04981,A,look here it s too hot for this we ve been talking and interviewing each other all the morning and i have another interview this afternoon i do stipulate for silence let each lady retire to her bedroom with a book
p04982_A,04982,A,oh certainly harriet i shall make a point of reminding him
p04983_A,04983,A,why of course you would be going two carriages then two carriages for the evening train harriet whatever are you up to we shall never be ready
p04984_A,04984,A,harriet harriet harriet harriet why don t you answer
p04985_A,04985,A,whatever is that
p04986_A,04986,A,i don t mind if i do wake him up i want to see him i ve as much right in him as you wait a minute but he s awake
p04987_A,04987,A,his face do you know struck me as all wrong
p04988_A,04988,A,all puckered queerly
p04989_A,04989,A,well hold him up again
p04990_A,04990,A,no he s crying hard i thought so before and i m certain now
p04991_A,04991,A,i say you haven t hurt it or held it the wrong way or anything it is too uncanny crying and no noise why didn t you get perfetta to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger it s a marvel he understood about the note
p04992_A,04992,A,but why not gino or perfetta
p04993_A,04993,A,i suppose he breathes and all that sort of thing
p04994_A,04994,A,i m nervous too i wish he d scream it s too uncanny poor gino i m terribly sorry for gino
p04995_A,04995,A,because he s weak like most of us he doesn t know what he wants he doesn t grip on to life but i like that man and i m sorry for him you despise him harriet and you despise me but you do us no good by it we fools want some one to set us on our feet suppose a really decent woman had set up gino i believe caroline abbott might have done it mightn t he have been another man
p04996_A,04996,A,are you all right
p04997_A,04997,A,god help me
p04998_A,04998,A,keep still let no one move we may tread on it keep still
p04999_A,04999,A,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose
p05000_A,05000,A,of course i mean an english church lilia promised me that she would always be in a large town on sundays
p05001_A,05001,A,every one to his taste
p05002_A,05002,A,after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma
p05003_A,05003,A,he is the devil
p05004_A,05004,A,i will thank you not to scoff against religion think of that poor baby irma is right to pray for him what an entrance into life for an english child
p05005_A,05005,A,it upsets one s plans terribly but obviously it is my duty
p05006_A,05006,A,yes indeed mother has written me a really beautiful letter she describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings how she has tried by letter and it is no good nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back then she says there is nothing like personal influence you and philip will succeed where i have failed she says too that caroline abbott has been wonderful caroline feels it as keenly almost as us that is because she knows the man oh he must be loathsome goodness me i ve forgotten to pack the ammonia it has been a terrible lesson for caroline but i fancy it is her turning point i can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come
p05007_A,05007,A,did you hear though they are remarking on the cold i should never have thought it cold what a religion foreigners are a filthy nation i don t care if there are tunnels open the windows
p05008_A,05008,A,a single for me i shall never get back alive
p05009_A,05009,A,do you suppose do you suppose i am going to enter that man s house
p05010_A,05010,A,to see that you do your duty
p05011_A,05011,A,so mother told me for goodness sake get the tickets here comes that hot woman again she has the impudence to bow
p05012_A,05012,A,what do they do there
p05013_A,05013,A,not for me thank you
p05014_A,05014,A,nothing at all it s frightful
p05015_A,05015,A,beauty is the only test at least so you told me when i sketched old buildings for the sake i suppose of making yourself unpleasant
p05016_A,05016,A,i shouldn t think you could it doesn t seem the best moment to begin your italy mania i thought you were cured of it by now instead will you kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive i do beg you will not be taken unawares this time
p05017_A,05017,A,you what s the good of cleverness if a man s murdered a woman
p05018_A,05018,A,he her if you don t look out he ll murder you i wish he would
p05019_A,05019,A,he has murdered her the things he did things one can t even mention
p05020_A,05020,A,it s the supreme test the man who is unchivalrous to a woman
p05021_A,05021,A,i condemn the whole lot
p05022_A,05022,A,and the french as well
p05023_A,05023,A,what about the baby pray you ve said a lot of smart things and whittled away morality and religion and i don t know what but what about the baby you think me a fool but i ve been noticing you all today and you haven t mentioned the baby once you haven t thought about it even you don t care philip i shall not speak to you you are intolerable go
p05024_A,05024,A,to the italian go
p05025_A,05025,A,go this instant now i ll stand it no longer go
p05026_A,05026,A,swear if you like blaspheme abuse me but understand i m in earnest
p05027_A,05027,A,we ve come here to get the baby back and for nothing else i ll not have this levity and slackness and talk about pictures and churches think of mother did she send you out for them
p05028_A,05028,A,i shan t

p05032_A,05032,A,i don t know the meaning of the word i ve told the landlady that philip and i only want our rooms one night and we shall keep to it
p05033_A,05033,A,he s insolent to ladies we know but my brother can be trusted to bring him to his senses that woman philip whom you saw will carry the baby to the hotel of course you must tip her for it and try if you can to get poor lilia s silver bangles they were nice quiet things and will do for irma and there is an inlaid box i lent her lent not gave to keep her handkerchiefs in it s of no real value but this is our only chance don t ask for it but if you see it lying about just say
p05034_A,05034,A,mother wouldn t like it it would be most unsuitable almost irreverent besides all that foreign theatres are notorious don t you remember those letters in the church family newspaper
p05035_A,05035,A,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence
p05036_A,05036,A,ridiculous babies
p05037_A,05037,A,call this classical it s not even respectable philip take me out at once

p05054_A,05054,A,nonsense we should hear him if he cried
p05055_A,05055,A,oh the night air i suppose or perhaps the wet of the rain
p05056_A,05056,A,oh he understands he tried to carry the baby
p05057_A,05057,A,philip don t talk must i say it again don t talk the baby wants to sleep
p05058_A,05058,A,of course you ve started him again i m certain he was asleep i do wish you wouldn t talk it makes me so nervous
p05059_A,05059,A,are you
p05060_A,05060,A,philip do you happen to have those matches handy we might as well look at the baby again if you have oh i don t want all that bother try again

p05062_A,05062,A,i stole it i stole it i stole it it slipped out of my arms
p05063_A,05063,A,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching
p05064_A,05064,A,we will save the peas to the last they are the greatest fun
p05065_A,05065,A,let philip say what he likes and he will let us do what we like it s twelve the second post s in run and see if there are any letters
p05066_A,05066,A,no dear please go i ll sow the peas but you shall cover them up and mind the birds don t see em
p05067_A,05067,A,read me the letter my hands are dirty how intolerable the crested paper is
p05068_A,05068,A,her letters never did
p05069_A,05069,A,what is the difficulty what is it that puzzles you in this letter
p05070_A,05070,A,the meaning is quite clear lilia is engaged to be married don t cry dear please me by not crying don t talk at all it s more than i could bear she is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel take the letter and read for yourself how dare she not tell me direct how dare she write first to yorkshire pray am i to hear through mrs theobald a patronizing insolent letter like this have i no claim at all bear witness dear bear witness that for this i ll never forgive her
p05071_A,05071,A,this first next a telegram for lilia no a telegram for miss caroline abbott she too has something to explain
p05072_A,05072,A,if there is an office there we might get an answer this evening since philip is back at seven and the eight fifteen catches the midnight boat at dover harriet when you go with this get 100 pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank go dear at once do not talk i see irma coming back go quickly well irma dear and whose team are you in this afternoon miss edith s or miss may s
p05073_A,05073,A,it is too bad it s ridiculous to read dear she s not trying to marry any one in the place some tourist obviously who s stopping in the hotel the place has nothing to do with it at all
p05074_A,05074,A,are we to go into mourning do you think
p05075_A,05075,A,it s a shame mother philip laughs at everything the book club the debating society the progressive whist the bazaars people won t like it we have our reputation a house divided against itself cannot stand
p05076_A,05076,A,let s finish the peas there won t be any letters
p05077_A,05077,A,actually old mrs theobald
p05078_A,05078,A,i don t understand it doesn t make sense
p05079_A,05079,A,but it must be sillier than usual look here read it mother i can t make head or tail
p05080_A,05080,A,the meaning
p05081_A,05081,A,oh what is to be done what is to be done
p05082_A,05082,A,oh what is to be done
p05083_A,05083,A,your feet grow larger every day
p05084_A,05084,A,but what a place to go to what nice person too do you meet in a hotel
p05085_A,05085,A,there s no need to twist the thing round to that
p05086_A,05086,A,are we to talk it over now
p05087_A,05087,A,then how long has she been engaged
p05088_A,05088,A,i should like to know how long if you can remember
p05089_A,05089,A,how long have you been here
p05090_A,05090,A,oh who is he
p05091_A,05091,A,i understood they met at the hotel
p05092_A,05092,A,perhaps i bore you with these questions if so i will stop
p05093_A,05093,A,then how old is he
p05094_A,05094,A,good lord
p05095_A,05095,A,and is he good looking
p05096_A,05096,A,may i conclude that you like him
p05097_A,05097,A,what is he please you haven t told me that what s his position
p05098_A,05098,A,as a private
p05099_A,05099,A,the men in it must be short and broad they must also be able to walk six miles an hour
p05100_A,05100,A,one more question and only one more what is his father
p05101_A,05101,A,yes miss abbott i know but i am anxious to hear heaven s choice you arouse my curiosity is my sister in law to marry an angel
p05102_A,05102,A,i cannot think what is in the air if lilia was determined to disgrace us she might have found a less repulsive way a boy of medium height with a pretty face the son of a dentist at monteriano have i put it correctly may i surmise that he has not got one penny may i also surmise that his social position is nil furthermore
p05103_A,05103,A,really miss abbott it is a little late for reticence you have equipped me admirably
p05104_A,05104,A,i sleep at the globo and start for sawston tomorrow morning early he has assaulted me i could prosecute him but shall not
p05105_A,05105,A,never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives
p05106_A,05106,A,indeed i never think about it now
p05107_A,05107,A,yes we counted on you
p05108_A,05108,A,really really you knew lilia all your life apart from everything else as if she could choose what could make her happy
p05109_A,05109,A,let us rather say unhappily expressed
p05110_A,05110,A,and the telegram
p05111_A,05111,A,did you really mean to stop
p05112_A,05112,A,would that have suited a newly married pair
p05113_A,05113,A,i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation
p05114_A,05114,A,but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation
p05115_A,05115,A,oh never mind
p05116_A,05116,A,so did and do i that s splendid go on
p05117_A,05117,A,petty selfishness
p05118_A,05118,A,why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent
p05119_A,05119,A,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position
p05120_A,05120,A,oh i don t think that
p05121_A,05121,A,oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you
p05122_A,05122,A,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p05123_A,05123,A,there are sure to be incidental expenses do you suppose we shall have difficulty with the man
p05124_A,05124,A,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent
p05125_A,05125,A,well what do you conclude from that
p05126_A,05126,A,yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children look at rodrigo borgia for example
p05127_A,05127,A,i was going to make myself some tea
p05128_A,05128,A,no more do i he was out
p05129_A,05129,A,he was out you find me as ignorant as you have left harriet
p05130_A,05130,A,pray let us start clear permit me to begin by asking you a question in which capacity have you come to monteriano spy or traitor
p05131_A,05131,A,it is hopeless to expect you to believe me but i can assert that we are here to get the child even if it costs us all we ve got my mother has fixed no money limit whatever i am here to carry out her instructions i think that you will approve of them as you have practically dictated them i do not approve of them they are absurd harriet also carries out your instructions she however approves of them and does not know that they proceed from you i think miss abbott you had better take entire charge of the rescue party i have asked for an interview with signor carella tomorrow morning do you acquiesce might i ask for details of your interview with him they might be helpful to me
p05132_A,05132,A,from perfetta if it interests you
p05133_A,05133,A,the woman who must have let you in
p05134_A,05134,A,into signor carella s house
p05135_A,05135,A,i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then
p05136_A,05136,A,yes yes i know the rocca i told you of it
p05137_A,05137,A,and you talked
p05138_A,05138,A,and of what did you talk
p05139_A,05139,A,my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower
p05140_A,05140,A,harriet would say he has no sense of sin
p05141_A,05141,A,if so perhaps he isn t sinful
p05142_A,05142,A,i should like to hear though what he said about me is he preparing a warm reception
p05143_A,05143,A,what a memory the fellow has for little things
p05144_A,05144,A,i lost my temper did he really what exactly did he say
p05145_A,05145,A,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset
p05146_A,05146,A,the view from the rocca wasn t it fine
p05147_A,05147,A,because harriet
p05148_A,05148,A,it reaches up to heaven and down to the other place is it to be a symbol of the town
p05149_A,05149,A,lucia di lammermoor by the master donizetti unique representation this evening
p05150_A,05150,A,why yes these people know how to live they would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all that is why they have got to have so much that is good however bad the performance is tonight it will be alive italians don t love music silently like the beastly germans the audience takes its share sometimes more
p05151_A,05151,A,good miss abbott you are coming too
p05152_A,05152,A,oh that ll be all right we ll go as we are and buy the best we can get monteriano is not formal we do all right
p05153_A,05153,A,don t you like it at all
p05154_A,05154,A,yes rather
p05155_A,05155,A,why no how could i the fact is well i got taken by surprise but after all what does it matter there s no earthly reason why we shouldn t do the business pleasantly he s a perfectly charming person and so are his friends i m his friend now his long lost brother what s the harm i tell you miss abbott it s one thing for england and another for italy there we plan and get on high moral horses here we find what asses we are for things go off quite easily all by themselves my hat what a night did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before well as i was saying it s absurd to worry he s not a porky father he wants that baby as little as i do he s been ragging my dear mother just as he ragged me eighteen months ago and i ve forgiven him oh but he has a sense of humour
p05156_A,05156,A,what might have happened to me he had made you believe that he loved the child
p05157_A,05157,A,at present it is still unsettled
p05158_A,05158,A,perhaps not well as i said i know what has happened and i am not here to scold you but i must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present harriet is furious but she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm and will do none
p05159_A,05159,A,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella
p05160_A,05160,A,well that s all i wanted to know i ll go and tell harriet of your promise and i think things ll quiet down now
p05161_A,05161,A,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother
p05162_A,05162,A,do this afternoon i have another interview
p05163_A,05163,A,then another if that fails i shall wire home for instructions i dare say we may fail altogether but we shall fail honourably
p05164_A,05164,A,why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns
p05165_A,05165,A,because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that
p05166_A,05166,A,you are wonderful
p05167_A,05167,A,miss abbott don t worry over me some people are born not to do things i m one of them i never did anything at school or at the bar i came out to stop lilia s marriage and it was too late i came out intending to get the baby and i shall return an honourable failure i never expect anything to happen now and so i am never disappointed you would be surprised to know what my great events are going to the theatre yesterday talking to you now i don t suppose i shall ever meet anything greater i seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it and i m sure i can t tell you whether the fate s good or evil i don t die i don t fall in love and if other people die or fall in love they always do it when i m just not there you are quite right life to me is just a spectacle which thank god and thank italy and thank you is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before
p05168_A,05168,A,you going
p05169_A,05169,A,well i suppose i shall and i shall also have my interview with signor carella but why should you mind do you suppose that i shall have the slightest influence over him
p05170_A,05170,A,perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it
p05171_A,05171,A,yes do now that we have quarrelled we scarcely want to travel in procession all the way down the hill well good bye it s all over at last another scene in my pageant has shifted
p05172_A,05172,A,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious
p05173_A,05173,A,he will have to marry her i heard from him this morning just as we left milan he finds he has gone too far to back out it would be expensive i don t know how much he minds not as much as we suppose i think at all events there s not a word of blame in the letter i don t believe he even feels angry i never was so completely forgiven ever since you stopped him killing me it has been a vision of perfect friendship he nursed me he lied for me at the inquest and at the funeral though he was crying you would have thought it was my son who had died certainly i was the only person he had to be kind to he was so distressed not to make harriet s acquaintance and that he scarcely saw anything of you in his letter he says so again
p05174_A,05174,A,indeed i will
p05175_A,05175,A,i hope next spring perhaps we shall paint siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money it was one of the arguments for marrying her
p05176_A,05176,A,no you re wrong he does he is unhappy like the rest of us but he doesn t try to keep up appearances as we do he knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again
p05177_A,05177,A,in his passion not when he was calm we english say it when we are calm when we do not really believe it any longer gino is not ashamed of inconsistency it is one of the many things i like him for
p05178_A,05178,A,i m sorry when will you come back do you think
p05179_A,05179,A,for whatever reason
p05180_A,05180,A,yes i can t live at sawston
p05181_A,05181,A,i wrote from monteriano i tried to explain things but she will never understand me her view will be that the affair is settled sadly settled since the baby is dead still it s over our family circle need be vexed no more she won t even be angry with you you see you have done us no harm in the long run unless of course you talk about harriet and make a scandal so that is my plan london and work what is yours
p05182_A,05182,A,is harriet going to be all right
p05183_A,05183,A,i m clear enough about harriet s future and about parts of my own but i ask again what about yours
p05184_A,05184,A,you ve seen too much you ve seen as much and done more than i have
p05185_A,05185,A,silly nonsense you re too good about a thousand times better than i am you can t live in that hole you must go among people who can hope to understand you i mind for myself i want to see you often again and again
p05186_A,05186,A,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough
p05187_A,05187,A,you will write
p05188_A,05188,A,but i say it s not enough you can t go back to the old life if you wanted to too much has happened
p05189_A,05189,A,not only pain and sorrow but wonderful things that tower in the sunlight do you remember it and all you said to me the theatre even and the next day in the church and our times with gino
p05190_A,05190,A,i don t believe it at all events not for me the most wonderful things may be to come
p05191_A,05191,A,miss abbott what is the matter with you i thought i understood you and i don t all those two great first days at monteriano i read you as clearly as you read me still i saw why you had come and why you changed sides and afterwards i saw your wonderful courage and pity and now you re frank with me one moment as you used to be and the next moment you shut me up you see i owe too much to you my life and i don t know what besides i won t stand it you ve gone too far to turn mysterious i ll quote what you said to me don t be mysterious there isn t the time i ll quote something else i and my life must be where i live you can t live at sawston
p05192_A,05192,A,are you lonely is it anything like that
p05193_A,05193,A,perhaps i do perhaps i could speak instead but if you will say the word plainly you ll never be sorry i will thank you for it all my life
p05194_A,05194,A,rather i love him too when i can forget how he hurt me that evening though whenever we shake hands
p05195_A,05195,A,laugh at love
p05196_A,05196,A,perhaps it is what the books call a passing fancy
p05197_A,05197,A,well if the fancy does pass let me know
p05198_A,05198,A,but before you retire to sawston are you so mighty sure
p05199_A,05199,A,that you and he i was going to say whatever have you got in common
p05200_A,05200,A,which which times
p05201_A,05201,A,but through my fault he is parted from the child he loves and because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again
p05202_A,05202,A,certainly please if you will be so very kind
p05203_A,05203,A,a short time quite a short time
p05204_A,05204,A,exactly eleven days
p05205_A,05205,A,close on three weeks
p05206_A,05206,A,a native of the place
p05207_A,05207,A,it was a mistake of mrs theobald s
p05208_A,05208,A,oh no please not at all i am here my own idea to give all information which you very naturally and to see if somehow please ask anything you like
p05209_A,05209,A,oh quite young twenty one i believe
p05210_A,05210,A,one would never believe it he looks much older
p05211_A,05211,A,very good looking all his features are good and he is well built though i dare say english standards would find him too short
p05212_A,05212,A,as far as i have seen him i do as far as i have seen him i do like him
p05213_A,05213,A,no position at all he is kicking his heels as my father would say you see he has only just finished his military service
p05214_A,05214,A,i suppose so there is general conscription he was in the bersaglieri i think isn t that the crack regiment
p05215_A,05215,A,meanwhile like most young men he lives with his people father mother two sisters and a tiny tot of a brother
p05216_A,05216,A,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven
p05217_A,05217,A,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist
p05218_A,05218,A,stop i ll tell you no more
p05219_A,05219,A,it is all so strange as well as so tragic and what i did was as strange as anything
p05220_A,05220,A,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame
p05221_A,05221,A,the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business
p05222_A,05222,A,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy
p05223_A,05223,A,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude
p05224_A,05224,A,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all
p05225_A,05225,A,ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you
p05226_A,05226,A,for a time at all events
p05227_A,05227,A,it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him
p05228_A,05228,A,well i have explained
p05229_A,05229,A,an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics
p05230_A,05230,A,i hated sawston you see
p05231_A,05231,A,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness
p05232_A,05232,A,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano
p05233_A,05233,A,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now
p05234_A,05234,A,we were mad drunk with rebellion we had no common sense as soon as you came you saw and foresaw everything
p05235_A,05235,A,i hope you see why i have troubled you with this long story women i heard you say the other day are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad all through me you see mr herriton it makes me specially unhappy it s the only time i ve ever gone into what my father calls real life and look what i ve made of it all that winter i seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and i don t know what and when the spring came i wanted to fight against the things i hated mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society i actually hated society for a day or two at monteriano i didn t see that all these things are invincible and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces thank you for listening to so much nonsense
p05236_A,05236,A,i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live
p05237_A,05237,A,i was meaning had you decided on anything
p05238_A,05238,A,then is nothing to be done for the child at all
p05239_A,05239,A,and if she decides on nothing please also let me know let me know in any case
p05240_A,05240,A,it depends
p05241_A,05241,A,i don t go by what i saw of him but by what i know of him
p05242_A,05242,A,that he is a thoroughly wicked man
p05243_A,05243,A,i have also seen examples of that in my district
p05244_A,05244,A,i should be grateful you see harriet knows nothing
p05245_A,05245,A,but what s that to do with it
p05246_A,05246,A,what do you mean please please mr herriton don t be mysterious there isn t the time any moment harriet may be down and we shan t have decided how to behave to her sawston was different we had to keep up appearances but here we must speak out and i think i can trust you to do it otherwise we ll never start clear
p05247_A,05247,A,spy spy your mother has behaved dishonourably all through she never wanted the child no harm in that but she is too proud to let it come to me she has done all she could to wreck things she did not tell you everything she has told harriet nothing at all she has lied or acted lies everywhere i cannot trust your mother so i have come here alone all across europe no one knows it my father thinks i am in normandy to spy on mrs herriton don t let s argue if you are here to get the child i will help you if you are here to fail i shall get it instead of you
p05248_A,05248,A,my interview how do you know of it
p05249_A,05249,A,who ever is perfetta
p05250_A,05250,A,in where
p05251_A,05251,A,mr herriton how could you believe her do you suppose that i would have entered that man s house knowing about him all that i do i think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady i hear you wanted harriet to go very properly she refused eighteen months ago i might have done such a thing but i trust i have learnt how to behave by now
p05252_A,05252,A,not an interview an accident i am very sorry i meant you to have the chance of seeing him first though it is your fault you are a day late you were due here yesterday so i came yesterday and not finding you went up to the rocca you know that kitchen garden where they let you in and there is a ladder up to a broken tower where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills
p05253_A,05253,A,so i went up in the evening for the sunset i had nothing to do he was in the garden it belongs to a friend of his
p05254_A,05254,A,it was very awkward for me but i had to talk he seemed to make me you see he thought i was here as a tourist he thinks so still he intended to be civil and i judged it better to be civil also
p05255_A,05255,A,the weather there will be rain he says by tomorrow evening the other towns england myself about you a little and he actually mentioned lilia he was perfectly disgusting he pretended he loved her he offered to show me her grave the grave of the woman he has murdered
p05256_A,05256,A,you may be right when i tried to pave the way so to speak to hint that he had not behaved as he ought well it was no good at all he couldn t or wouldn t understand
p05257_A,05257,A,harriet may be right i am afraid
p05258_A,05258,A,i know what he has done what he says and what he thinks is of very little importance
p05259_A,05259,A,oh no not that i never told him that you and harriet were coming you could have taken him by surprise if you liked he only asked for you and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago
p05260_A,05260,A,you did not think it a little thing at the time you told me he had assaulted you
p05261_A,05261,A,he said he was sorry pleasantly as italians do say such things but he never mentioned the baby once
p05262_A,05262,A,and he never mentioned the baby once
p05263_A,05263,A,what isn t fine here i wish i was harriet
p05264_A,05264,A,mr herriton come here look at this
p05265_A,05265,A,surely that isn t an opera bill
p05266_A,05266,A,but is there an opera right up here
p05267_A,05267,A,can t we go
p05268_A,05268,A,we should hardly enjoy it with the great interview impending
p05269_A,05269,A,unfortunately i have no evening dress and if the seats
p05270_A,05270,A,yes i know but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones we had no need to come to italy like guys
p05271_A,05271,A,that was he wasn t it
p05272_A,05272,A,i suppose you didn t settle anything
p05273_A,05273,A,i am sure that i need it i ve nothing to tell you i have simply changed straight round if i had planned the whole thing out i could not have treated you worse i can talk it over now but please believe that i have been crying
p05274_A,05274,A,oh yes he has he will never give it up
p05275_A,05275,A,it will never be settled
p05276_A,05276,A,i can do no more but i tell you plainly i have changed sides
p05277_A,05277,A,oh certainly i don t want to speak to him again i shan t ever see him again
p05278_A,05278,A,why aren t you angry with me
p05279_A,05279,A,you do understand wonderfully you are the only one of us who has a general view of the muddle so what are you going to do
p05280_A,05280,A,it will come to nothing well
p05281_A,05281,A,that s not doing anything you would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby or if you went straight away but that to fail honourably to come out of the thing as well as you can is that all you are after
p05282_A,05282,A,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all
p05283_A,05283,A,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair
p05284_A,05284,A,oh you appreciate me i wish you didn t you appreciate us all see good in all of us and all the time you are dead dead dead look why aren t you angry you are so splendid mr herriton that i can t bear to see you wasted i can t bear she has not been good to you your mother
p05285_A,05285,A,i wish something would happen to you my dear friend i wish something would happen to you
p05286_A,05286,A,and please would you order a carriage for me too
p05287_A,05287,A,of course why not
p05288_A,05288,A,no but i can t repeat all that i said in the church you ought never to see him again you ought to bundle harriet into a carriage not this evening but now and drive her straight away
p05289_A,05289,A,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever
p05290_A,05290,A,good bye it s been a great pleasure to see you i hope that won t shift at all events
p05291_A,05291,A,i suppose i do
p05292_A,05292,A,but your son is dead gino your son is dead dear gino your son is dead what is the good of another death what is the good of more pain go to him pick him up treat him kindly
p05293_A,05293,A,remember there is to be no revenge i will have no more intentional evil we are not to fight with each other any more
p05294_A,05294,A,thank him please when you write and give him my kindest regards
p05295_A,05295,A,when will you see him again
p05296_A,05296,A,he has no heart he does not really mind about the child at all
p05297_A,05297,A,he said he would never be happy again
p05298_A,05298,A,yes i was wrong that is so
p05299_A,05299,A,i think never
p05300_A,05300,A,because i understand the place there is no need
p05301_A,05301,A,are your plans decided
p05302_A,05302,A,have you told mrs herriton
p05303_A,05303,A,poor harriet as if i dare judge harriet or anybody
p05304_A,05304,A,she will soon be her old self
p05305_A,05305,A,why not
p05306_A,05306,A,but it s so different of course i shall go to sawston you forget my father and even if he wasn t there i ve a hundred ties my district i m neglecting it shamefully my evening classes the st james
p05307_A,05307,A,of course we shall meet whenever you come down and i hope that it will mean often
p05308_A,05308,A,we can write at all events
p05309_A,05309,A,i will indeed
p05310_A,05310,A,i know that
p05311_A,05311,A,all the wonderful things are over that is just where it is
p05312_A,05312,A,the wonderful things are over
p05313_A,05313,A,it is tempting it is tempting not to be mysterious i ve wanted often to tell you and then been afraid i could never tell any one else certainly no woman and i think you re the one man who might understand and not be disgusted

p05322_A,05322,A,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round
p05323_A,05323,A,don t talk of faults you re my friend for ever mr herriton i think only don t be charitable and shift or take the blame get over supposing i m refined that s what puzzles you get over that i say again don t be charitable if he had asked me i might have given myself body and soul that would have been the end of my rescue party but all through he took me for a superior being a goddess i who was worshipping every inch of him and every word he spoke and that saved me

p05413_A,05413,A,oh i forgot your horrid celibacy in england they would be the centre of everything but why shouldn t i know them would it make it easier if i called all round isn t that your foreign way but i must know some one who were the men you were talking to this afternoon but gino dear if they re low class why did you talk to them don t you care about your position
p05414_A,05414,A,i always do it in england
p05415_A,05415,A,yes but i m older than you and i ll settle
p05416_A,05416,A,you laugh
p05417_A,05417,A,it s nothing
p05418_A,05418,A,you are a boy yourself gino
p05419_A,05419,A,they all do it myself excepted but tell me more she is english that is good very good an english wife is very good indeed and she is rich
p05420_A,05420,A,is it possible
p05421_A,05421,A,we all desire one but you gino deserve your good fortune for you are a good son a brave man and a true friend and from the very first moment i saw you i wished you well
p05422_A,05422,A,tell me i forgot to ask is she young
p05423_A,05423,A,ah well we cannot have everything
p05424_A,05424,A,is she simpatica
p05425_A,05425,A,it is a most important thing
p05426_A,05426,A,it is not sufficient one does not define it thus last month a german was smuggling cigars the custom house was dark yet i refused because i did not like him the gifts of such men do not bring happiness non era simpatico he paid for every one and the fine for deception besides
p05427_A,05427,A,i do not accept small sums now it is not worth the risk but the german was another matter but listen my gino for i am older than you and more full of experience the person who understands us at first sight who never irritates us who never bores to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish not only in speech but in silence that is what i mean by simpatico
p05428_A,05428,A,that is true here you are wiser than i sono poco simpatiche le donne and the time we waste over them is much
p05429_A,05429,A,you will never see him again and by now the scene will have passed from his mind
p05430_A,05430,A,that is a pity she must be persuaded it will be a great solace to her when she is alone
p05431_A,05431,A,of course not still you might take her at first that is what my brother has done with his wife at bologna and he has joined the free thinkers he took her once or twice himself and now she has acquired the habit and continues to go without him
p05432_A,05432,A,oh the english they are always thinking of tea they carry it by the kilogramme in their trunks and they are so clumsy that they always pack it at the top but it is absurd
p05433_A,05433,A,do nothing or ask me
p05434_A,05434,A,of course i was only joking
p05435_A,05435,A,if i do come and take tea with you this bill must be my affair
p05436_A,05436,A,passionately i have not studied scientific music but the music of the heart yes
p05437_A,05437,A,immensely rich
p05438_A,05438,A,it pleases me very much if you remember i always desired a blonde
p05439_A,05439,A,no compliments i beg
p05440_A,05440,A,thirty three
p05441_A,05441,A,but you would be surprised had she told me twenty eight i should not have disbelieved her
p05442_A,05442,A,sufficiently so
p05443_A,05443,A,she is rich she is generous she is affable she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness
p05444_A,05444,A,do you gain much beyond your pay
p05445_A,05445,A,there are such men i know and i have heard it said of children but where will you find such a woman
p05446_A,05446,A,one i have seen who may be so she spoke very little but she was a young lady different to most she too was english the companion of my wife here but fra filippo the brother in law took her back with him i saw them start he was very angry i regret though that i toppled him on to the bed a great tall man and when i am really amused i am often impolite
p05447_A,05447,A,she does not yet understand she asked me to accompany her sometimes to walk without object you know she would like me to be with her all day
p05448_A,05448,A,i am a catholic but of course i never go to church
p05449_A,05449,A,most excellent advice and i thank you for it but she wishes to give tea parties men and women together whom she has never seen
p05450_A,05450,A,what am i to do about it
p05451_A,05451,A,come she will be quite pleased
p05452_A,05452,A,i know but she wants me to take my friends come now waiter
p05453_A,05453,A,i think you are quite right i shall not bring people to the house any more i do not see why an english wife should be treated differently this is italy
p05454_A,05454,A,is it not true does not he deserve this wealthy blonde
p05455_A,05455,A,he does deserve her
p05456_A,05456,A,do you like music
p05457_A,05457,A,none of his clothes seemed to fit too big in one place too small in another what has happened he is ill ill
p05458_A,05458,A,what did you say to him
p05459_A,05459,A,ah who could help it i who thought you knew and saw nothing i am tricked i am conquered i give in let us talk of it no more
p05460_A,05460,A,how dare you you wicked girl give it here
p05461_A,05461,A,i dare say you have heard
p05462_A,05462,A,as far as i know no steps mrs theobald may have decided on something but i have not heard of it
p05463_A,05463,A,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald
p05464_A,05464,A,i sometimes have given her advice in the past i should not presume to do so now
p05465_A,05465,A,my dear caroline you must not brood over the thing let bygones be bygones the child should worry you even less than it worries us we never even mention it it belongs to another world
p05466_A,05466,A,my dear how you throw about your money we would never allow it
p05467_A,05467,A,yes i have i came to ask you have any steps been taken
p05468_A,05468,A,but does not mrs theobald always take any initiative from you
p05469_A,05469,A,the child came into the world through my negligence it is natural i should take an interest in it
p05470_A,05470,A,of course if mrs theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable i must say i don t see any such i shall ask if i may join her in it for irma s sake and share in any possible expenses please would you let me know if she decides on anything i should like to join as well
p05471_A,05471,A,very fine of mrs herriton very fine indeed i m afraid it will mean a lot of expense she will get nothing out of italy without paying
p05472_A,05472,A,la prego piano piano c e un altra signorina che dorme
p05473_A,05473,A,depend upon it she has gone to signor carella s to say good bye to her little nephew
p05474_A,05474,A,the poor idiot he cannot speak he takes messages for us all
p05475_A,05475,A,she has gone for a walk she has gone for a walk perhaps to wish good bye to her little nephew preferring to come back another way she has sent you this note by the poor idiot and is waiting for you outside the siena gate many of my guests do this
p05476_A,05476,A,i ll show you
p05477_A,05477,A,she will show you follow her always always and you will come to no harm she is a trustworthy guide she is my daughter cousin sister
p05478_A,05478,A,do you chance to know whether signor carella is in
p05479_A,05479,A,when will he be back i shall have to leave a message
p05480_A,05480,A,thank you here is my card has a young lady happened to call here lately a young english lady a young lady pale large tall a young lady
p05481_A,05481,A,that is perfetta
p05482_A,05482,A,perfetta is deaf when she chooses
p05483_A,05483,A,beautiful as an angel but who am i addressing
p05484_A,05484,A,i will be as quick as i can but there are many streets in monteriano he is sometimes difficult to find i could not find him this morning
p05485_A,05485,A,three hours then or four or make him learn english ways at florence we get a nurse
p05486_A,05486,A,theatres here and at such a moment
p05487_A,05487,A,good gracious me i should never have thought of that as likely as not we should have tried to save money and sat among the most awful people one keeps on forgetting this is italy
p05488_A,05488,A,we must make a stand from the beginning they re talking
p05489_A,05489,A,and order a carriage to take us to the evening train
p05490_A,05490,A,but harriet what if at first he was to refuse
p05491_A,05491,A,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats
p05492_A,05492,A,it is tiresome but perhaps it isn t for us to interfere
p05493_A,05493,A,gino s friends are ours
p05494_A,05494,A,come in to us
p05495_A,05495,A,scusi tanto
p05496_A,05496,A,business with me
p05497_A,05497,A,before business you must get well this is the best wine
p05498_A,05498,A,you are not well enough to go back and i am not engaged ah now i understand now i see what frightened you but why did you never speak
p05499_A,05499,A,you must not stand let us sit on the loggia where it is cool i am afraid the room is very untidy
p05500_A,05500,A,but guess e manca questo
p05501_A,05501,A,exactly and when my poor wife died when my poor wife died i thought of having my relatives to live here my father wished to give up his practice at empoli my mother and sisters and two aunts were also willing but it was impossible they have their ways of doing things and when i was younger i was content with them but now i am a man i have my own ways do you understand
p05502_A,05502,A,immense and the taxes but it will be better when ah but you have never guessed why i went to poggibonsi why it was that i was out when he called
p05503_A,05503,A,but try
p05504_A,05504,A,but we are old friends and your approval will be grateful to me you gave it me once before will you give it now
p05505_A,05505,A,oh signorina surely you approve of marriage
p05506_A,05506,A,where there is love
p05507_A,05507,A,but why
p05508_A,05508,A,why yes a little
p05509_A,05509,A,i shall not say it it will be untrue now my poor wife so you do not advise me but why should it be a failure
p05510_A,05510,A,whatever i say displeases you signorina god help you for you are most unfair you say that i ill treated my dear wife it is not so i have never ill treated any one you complain that there is no love in this marriage i prove that there is and you become still more angry what do you want do you suppose she will not be contented glad enough she is to get me and she will do her duty well
p05511_A,05511,A,why of course she knows why i am marrying her
p05512_A,05512,A,to look after the baby certainly
p05513_A,05513,A,it is an english marriage i do not care about the money i am having her for my son did you not understand that
p05514_A,05514,A,i know ah in a foreign language and how perfectly you speak italian one is certain to make slips you meant that we could not always be together yet he and i you are right what is to be done i cannot afford a nurse and perfetta is too rough when he was ill i dare not let her touch him when he has to be washed which happens now and then who does it i i feed him or settle what he shall have i sleep with him and comfort him when he is unhappy in the night no one talks no one may sing to him but i do not be unfair this time i like to do these things but nevertheless his voice became pathetic they take up a great deal of time and are not all suitable for a young man
p05515_A,05515,A,a little more wine
p05516_A,05516,A,empoli i would as soon have him in england
p05517_A,05517,A,he is not much longer than my boot is he can you believe that in time his own boots will be as large and that he also
p05518_A,05518,A,father son this woman will do exactly what i tell her she is fond of children she is clean she has a pleasant voice she is not beautiful i cannot pretend that to you for a moment but she is what i require
p05519_A,05519,A,it is nothing if he cries silently then you may be frightened he thinks i am going to wash him and he is quite right
p05520_A,05520,A,i had gone to the farmacia and was sitting there comfortably when suddenly i remembered that perfetta had heated water an hour ago over there look covered with a cushion i came away at once for really he must be washed you must excuse me i can put it off no longer
p05521_A,05521,A,but why are you going excuse me if i wash him while we talk
p05522_A,05522,A,oh but stop a moment you have not seen him yet
p05523_A,05523,A,take him
p05524_A,05524,A,who would have believed his mother was blonde for he is brown all over brown every inch of him ah but how beautiful he is and he is mine mine for ever even if he hates me he will be mine he cannot help it he is made out of me i am his father

p00000_B,00000,B,and he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low grade clerk and tells no one the reason what more do you require him to do
p00001_B,00001,B,but you understand my meaning
p00002_B,00002,B,i was going to suggest we go behind the purdah but your three treacherous children are there so you will not want to
p00003_B,00003,B,if you had been sensible and made miss quested pay
p00004_B,00004,B,i believe the politicals are obliged to have better manners it amounts to no more
p00005_B,00005,B,on the one hand he always does this on the other it may be a serious case and you cannot know had you not better clean your teeth after pan
p00006_B,00006,B,some case i daresay
p00007_B,00007,B,he is ill and he is not ill and i suppose that most of us are in that same case the whole world looks to be dying still it doesn t die so we must assume the existence of a beneficent providence
p00008_B,00008,B,yes he has done his duty do not tease him so he carries on his family two boys and their sister
p00009_B,00009,B,no no i do not admit that i have met others

p00011_B,00011,B,yet some orderly demonstration is necessary otherwise they will still think we are afraid
p00012_B,00012,B,oh that is going much too far
p00013_B,00013,B,aziz aziz imprudent boy
p00014_B,00014,B,where to turtons and burtons all are the same
p00015_B,00015,B,to such a remark there is certainly no reply have you heard this naughty rumour that mohammed latif has got hold of
p00016_B,00016,B,do not apologize you are always late
p00017_B,00017,B,aziz don t chatter we are having a very sad talk
p00018_B,00018,B,and mine
p00019_B,00019,B,very well but your life must continue a poor man s no holidays in kashmir for you yet you must stick to your profession and rise to a highly paid post not retire to a jungle state and write poems educate your children read the latest scientific periodicals compel european doctors to respect you accept the consequences of your own actions like a man
p00020_B,00020,B,but the money the money they will never pay an adequate salary those savage rajahs
p00021_B,00021,B,you mustn t put off what you think right that is why india is in such a plight because we put off things
p00022_B,00022,B,nureddin s mother is visiting my wife now that is all right i think
p00023_B,00023,B,you are a very selfish boy but take my case the case of young hugh bannister here is the son of my dear my dead friends the reverend and mrs bannister whose goodness to me in england i shall never forget or describe they were father and mother to me i talked to them as i do now in the vacations their rectory became my home they entrusted all their children to me i often carried little hugh about i took him up to the funeral of queen victoria and held him in my arms above the crowd
p00024_B,00024,B,it is far the wisest way to take them but not possible in the long run sooner or later a disaster such as yours occurs and reveals their secret thoughts about our character if god himself descended from heaven into their club and said you were innocent they would disbelieve him now you see why mahmoud ali and self waste so much time over intrigues and associate with creatures like ram chand
p00025_B,00025,B,aunt they live most comfortably with my wife s mother where she was living when she died i can see them whenever i like they are such very very small children
p00026_B,00026,B,just still your meaning doesn t help me out of my difficulties i am determined to leave chandrapore the problem is for where i am determined to write poetry the problem is about what you give me no assistance but who does give me assistance no one is my friend all are traitors even my own children i have had enough of friends
p00027_B,00027,B,i am sorry it is ever since i was in prison my temper is strange take me forgive me
p00028_B,00028,B,a pleasant change for her if he did
p00029_B,00029,B,it is not going as far as mr ram chand
p00030_B,00030,B,if my teeth are to be cleaned i don t go at all i am an indian it is an indian habit to take pan the civil surgeon must put up with it mohammed latif my bike please
p00031_B,00031,B,i daresay not i daresay nothing he has found out our dinner hour that s all and chooses to interrupt us every time in order to show his power
p00032_B,00032,B,i cannot endure committees i shall go right away
p00033_B,00033,B,once is enough
p00034_B,00034,B,why talk about the english brrrr why be either friends with the fellows or not friends let us shut them out and be jolly queen victoria and mrs bannister were the only exceptions and they re dead
p00035_B,00035,B,that pure minded fellow however he will blame the indian climate everything is our fault really now have i not discovered an important piece of news for you cyril
p00036_B,00036,B,but not in an indian state
p00037_B,00037,B,i shall never be rich anywhere it is outside my character
p00038_B,00038,B,but the sahib has left me some message
p00039_B,00039,B,i chose not to discussion of the past is useless i have allowed her to keep her fortune and buy herself a husband in england for which it will be very necessary don t mention the matter again
p00040_B,00040,B,kindly answer my question am i late has mahmoud ali eaten all the food if so i go elsewhere mr mahmoud ali how are you
p00041_B,00041,B,does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier world of yours
p00042_B,00042,B,i do not believe him
p00043_B,00043,B,we are not in the law courts there are many ways of being a man mine is to express what is deepest in my heart
p00044_B,00044,B,old callendar wants to see me at his bungalow he might have the politeness to say why
p00045_B,00045,B,they come before me separately but not so far together you had better prepare them for the united shock of my face
p00046_B,00046,B,oh not yet hookah is so jolly now
p00047_B,00047,B,i do want to get away from british india even to a poor job i think i could write poetry there i wish i had lived in babur s time and fought and written for him gone gone and not even any use to say for it weakens us while we say it we need a king hamidullah it would make our lives easier as it is we must try to appreciate these quaint hindus my notion now is to try for some post as doctor in one of their states
p00048_B,00048,B,they put pepper instead of antiseptic on the wounds
p00049_B,00049,B,thank you dr aziz i am dying
p00050_B,00050,B,hamidullah here is actually dead he passed away just as you rode up on your bike
p00051_B,00051,B,forward forward down with the collector down with the superintendent of police
p00052_B,00052,B,dying before your dinner oh poor mahmoud ali
p00053_B,00053,B,oh my god
p00054_B,00054,B,oh my god my god he called him a nigger did he
p00055_B,00055,B,yes that is so imagine us both as addressing you from another and a happier world
p00056_B,00056,B,i only contend that it is possible in england
p00057_B,00057,B,i do not think so they all become exactly the same not worse not better i give any englishman two years be he turton or burton it is only the difference of a letter and i give any englishwoman six months all are exactly alike do you not agree with me
p00058_B,00058,B,come and see my wife a little then
p00059_B,00059,B,and does it
p00060_B,00060,B,yes they have no chance here that is my point they come out intending to be gentlemen and are told it will not do look at lesley look at blakiston now it is your red nosed boy and fielding will go next why i remember when turton came out first it was in another part of the province you fellows will not believe me but i have driven with turton in his carriage turton oh yes we were once quite intimate he has shown me his stamp collection
p00061_B,00061,B,we all admire them aziz please pass me the hookah
p00062_B,00062,B,i learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at cawnpore imagine how i long to see him and to pay his fare that this house may be his home but it is useless the other anglo indians will have got hold of him long ago he will probably think that i want something and i cannot face that from the son of my old friends oh what in this country has gone wrong with everything vakil sahib i ask you
p00063_B,00063,B,well look at my own experience this morning
p00064_B,00064,B,it is impossible here aziz the red nosed boy has again insulted me in court i do not blame him he was told that he ought to insult me until lately he was quite a nice boy but the others have got hold of him
p00065_B,00065,B,i do not for my own part i find such profound differences among our rulers red nose mumbles turton talks distinctly mrs turton takes bribes mrs red nose does not and cannot because so far there is no mrs red nose
p00066_B,00066,B,down with the civil surgeon rescue nureddin
p00067_B,00067,B,no that is where mrs turton is so skilful when we poor blacks take bribes we perform what we are bribed to perform and the law discovers us in consequence the english take and do nothing i admire them
p00068_B,00068,B,he would expect you to steal it now turton but red nosed boy will be far worse than turton
p00069_B,00069,B,queen victoria was different
p00070_B,00070,B,so have i all ladies are far from alike
p00071_B,00071,B,but of course all this is exceptional the exception does not prove the rule the average woman is like mrs turton and aziz you know what she is
p00072_B,00072,B,what is to become of all our daughters if men refuse to marry they will marry beneath them or
p00073_B,00073,B,perhaps but later
p00074_B,00074,B,ours take the gifts the gods provide anyhow

p00113_B,00113,B,i left them at the entrance
p00114_B,00114,B,mrs mrs moore i am afraid i startled you i shall tell my community our friends about you that god is here very good very fine indeed i think you are newly arrived in india
p00115_B,00115,B,how is that oh explain to me
p00116_B,00116,B,may i know your name
p00117_B,00117,B,it will soon be so unhealthy for you and why ever do you come to chandrapore
p00118_B,00118,B,she has just taken my tonga without my permission do you call that being charming and major callendar interrupts me night after night from where i am dining with my friends and i go at once breaking up a most pleasant entertainment and he is not there and not even a message is this charming pray but what does it matter i can do nothing and he knows it i am just a subordinate my time is of no value the verandah is good enough for an indian yes yes let him stand and mrs callendar takes my carriage and cuts me dead you understand me you know what others feel oh if others resembled you
p00119_B,00119,B,what was the name of the play
p00120_B,00120,B,good bye mrs moore
p00121_B,00121,B,i m a doctor snakes don t dare bite me please may i ask you a question now why do you come to india at this time of year just as the cold weather is ending
p00122_B,00122,B,oh no excuse me that is quite impossible our city magistrate s name is mr heaslop i know him intimately
p00123_B,00123,B,oh she s all right she went down to see miss derek well here s luck chin chin
p00124_B,00124,B,of course but so few ladies take the trouble especially if thinking no one is there to see
p00125_B,00125,B,by the way you address me no but can i call you a carriage
p00126_B,00126,B,that is even more impossible but may i know the facts
p00127_B,00127,B,then we are in the same box then is the city magistrate the entire of your family now
p00128_B,00128,B,mrs moore this is all extremely strange because like yourself i have also two sons and a daughter is not this the same box with a vengeance
p00129_B,00129,B,and how rough and rude i was and how good you were
p00130_B,00130,B,oh can i do you some service now or at any time
p00131_B,00131,B,would you care to see over the minto hospital one morning i have nothing else to offer at chandrapore
p00132_B,00132,B,what what you didn t like her
p00133_B,00133,B,i suppose the civil surgeon took you
p00134_B,00134,B,but mrs moore how can he be
p00135_B,00135,B,dear mrs moore what does anything matter so long as you are my guests i am very glad you are not coming which sounds strange but you are treating me with true frankness as a friend yes i am your friend so may i make another suggestion don t let so many people come with you this time i think you may find it more convenient exactly exactly is that all right
p00136_B,00136,B,i think you ought not to walk at night alone mrs moore there are bad characters about and leopards may come across from the marabar hills snakes also for example a six spot beetle you pick it up it bites you die
p00137_B,00137,B,yes now i see and your first husband died
p00138_B,00138,B,friendships last longest that begin like that i think shall i ever entertain your other children
p00139_B,00139,B,madam this is a mosque you have no right here at all you should have taken off your shoes this is a holy place for moslems
p00140_B,00140,B,you have
p00141_B,00141,B,ah a very charming lady
p00142_B,00142,B,then you are an oriental indians are not allowed into the chandrapore club even as guests
p00143_B,00143,B,there ll be no muddle when you come to see me mrs moore and everyone i invite you all oh please oh but we will talk of something else now i wish i lived here see this beautiful room let us admire it together for a little see those curves at the bottom of the arches what delicacy it is the architecture of question and answer mrs moore you are in india i am not joking i am doing justice here a poor widow who has been robbed comes along and i give her fifty rupees to another a hundred and so on and so on i should like that
p00144_B,00144,B,oh i am used to it
p00145_B,00145,B,no indeed how funny it sounds their names are quite different and will surprise you listen please i am about to tell you my children s names the first is called ahmed the second is called karim the third she is the eldest jamila three children are enough do not you agree with me
p00146_B,00146,B,and the gentleman here is he ralph and stella s half brother
p00147_B,00147,B,mine would god would give me more when he saw i gave always be giving like the nawab bahadur my father was the same that is why he died poor so we would sit giving for ever on a carpet instead of chairs that is the chief change between now and then but i think we would never punish anyone poor criminal give him another chance it only makes a man worse to go to prison and be corrupted we punish no one no one and in the evening we will give a great banquet with a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands and all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day when there shall be justice as before fifty rupees a hundred a thousand till peace comes ah why didn t we live in that time but are you admiring mr fielding s house do look how the pillars are painted blue and the verandah s pavilions what do you call them that are above us inside are blue also look at the carving on the pavilions think of the hours it took their little roofs are curved to imitate bamboo so pretty and the bamboos waving by the tank outside mrs moore mrs moore
p00148_B,00148,B,then i ask your pardon i am truly sorry for speaking
p00149_B,00149,B,don t you come too adela you dislike institutions
p00150_B,00150,B,i feared at mr fielding s that it might be settled the other way black knave on a red queen
p00151_B,00151,B,ah very likely
p00152_B,00152,B,call what a ghost
p00153_B,00153,B,i like mysteries but i rather dislike muddles
p00154_B,00154,B,i shall attend your marriage but not your trial then i shall go to england
p00155_B,00155,B,it is your difficulty not mine my dear
p00156_B,00156,B,say say say as if anything can be said i have spent my life in saying or in listening to sayings i have listened too much it is time i was left in peace not to die no doubt you expect me to die but when i have seen you and ronny married and seen the other two and whether they want to be married i ll retire then into a cave of my own somewhere where no young people will come asking questions and expecting answers some shelf
p00157_B,00157,B,i couldn t have been thinking of what i was saying
p00158_B,00158,B,it is the children who are the first consideration until they are grown up and married off when that happens one has again the right to live for oneself in the plains or the hills as suits
p00159_B,00159,B,i am not good no bad a bad old woman bad bad detestable i used to be good with the children growing up also i meet this young man in his mosque i wanted him to be happy good happy small people they do not exist they were a dream but i will not help you to torture him for what he never did there are different ways of evil and i prefer mine to yours
p00160_B,00160,B,i was going to tell you adela but something changed the conversation and i forgot my memory grows deplorable
p00161_B,00161,B,that s much the best feeling to have
p00162_B,00162,B,if you don t know you don t know i can t tell you
p00163_B,00163,B,don t you know
p00164_B,00164,B,i believe in the hot weather but never did i suppose it would bottle me up as it will
p00165_B,00165,B,only various shades of the dark
p00166_B,00166,B,very nice
p00167_B,00167,B,ah dearest grasmere
p00168_B,00168,B,i don t think i shall go on to there i dislike climbing
p00169_B,00169,B,is it again my duty to talk apparently as you keep interrupting me
p00170_B,00170,B,they startle one rather a strange place to make tea in
p00171_B,00171,B,i shouldn t mind if it had happened anywhere else at least i really don t know where it did happen
p00172_B,00172,B,i wouldn t worry it s partly the odd surroundings you and i keep on attending to trifles instead of what s important we are what the people here call new
p00173_B,00173,B,very well you get another servant and i ll keep antony with me i am used to his unappetizing ways he will see me through the hot weather
p00174_B,00174,B,of course he is innocent
p00175_B,00175,B,i want to see it too and i only wish we could apparently the turtons will arrange something for next tuesday
p00176_B,00176,B,i went to the mosque but i did not catch the moon
p00177_B,00177,B,a horrid stuffy place really
p00178_B,00178,B,ah but that ll disappoint him so he has taken such trouble you should go on you don t mind
p00179_B,00179,B,oh what of the echo
p00180_B,00180,B,india s
p00181_B,00181,B,if one has not become too stupid and old
p00182_B,00182,B,she has children you see
p00183_B,00183,B,i don t suppose you ever will
p00184_B,00184,B,later and later let me think we don t see the other side of the moon out here no
p00185_B,00185,B,drop me too i don t want to watch polo either i m sure
p00186_B,00186,B,i should like to i don t feel a bit excited i m just glad it s settled up at last but i m not conscious of vast changes we are all three the same people still
p00187_B,00187,B,the animal thing that hit us didn t you say oh a ghost in passing
p00188_B,00188,B,you mean that my bothers are mixed up with india
p00189_B,00189,B,yes that is so
p00190_B,00190,B,i won t have her dragged in either i won t have any more trouble on my account her evidence is not the least essential
p00191_B,00191,B,ah that s true well by marrying mr heaslop i shall become what is known as an anglo indian
p00192_B,00192,B,i think you re rather unkind not to say
p00193_B,00193,B,what made you call it a ghost
p00194_B,00194,B,i won t be bottled up i ve no patience with these women here who leave their husbands grilling in the plains mrs mcbryde hasn t stopped down once since she married she leaves her quite intelligent husband alone half the year and then s surprised she s out of touch with him
p00195_B,00195,B,i don t hear it so much you send it away you do nothing but good you are so good
p00196_B,00196,B,was he nice
p00197_B,00197,B,we must have a thorough talk ronny i m afraid
p00198_B,00198,B,no what is it oh do say i felt you would be able to explain it this will comfort me so
p00199_B,00199,B,mrs moore what is this echo
p00200_B,00200,B,i want to sack antony his behaviour on the platform has decided me anyhow we must get a second servant because at simla you will be at the hotel and i don t think ronny s baldeo
p00201_B,00201,B,oh yes you re perfectly right i never thought it out
p00202_B,00202,B,i ld like to come very much indeed and so would mrs moore i know
p00203_B,00203,B,my idea now is that my cousins shall find me a servant in simla at all events to see me through the wedding after which ronny means to reorganize his staff entirely he does it very well for a bachelor still when he is married no doubt various changes will have to be made his old servants won t want to take their orders from me and i don t blame them anything to be seen of the hills
p00204_B,00204,B,but he says this isn t a good cave the best are on the kawa dol
p00205_B,00205,B,you see ronny i was right
p00206_B,00206,B,it was probably a hyena as a matter of fact
p00207_B,00207,B,perhaps i ought to
p00208_B,00208,B,i suppose so
p00209_B,00209,B,get in dr aziz you make us giddy if they re so foolish as to miss the train that s their loss not ours
p00210_B,00210,B,i thought you said but it was in mr fielding s letter
p00211_B,00211,B,it ll end in an elephant ride it always does look at this evening cousin kate imagine cousin kate but where have you been off to did you succeed in catching the moon in the ganges
p00212_B,00212,B,the angle would have altered she rises later
p00213_B,00213,B,we can t be far from the place where my hyena was perhaps this is mine anyhow the road runs parallel with the railway i will fetch you from simla when it s cool enough i will unbottle you in fact we then see some of the mogul stuff how appalling if we let you miss the taj and then i will see you off at bombay your last glimpse of this country really shall be interesting they re rather wonderful i ld not have missed this for anything look the sun s rising this ll be absolutely magnificent come quickly look i wouldn t have missed this for anything we should never have seen it if we d stuck to the turtons and their eternal elephants ah that must be the false dawn isn t it caused by dust in the upper layers of the atmosphere that couldn t fall down during the night i think mr mcbryde said so well i must admit that england has it as regards sunrises do you remember grasmere
p00214_B,00214,B,very well let s sit down again in the shade until breakfast s ready
p00215_B,00215,B,yes i mean that at least not exactly but there is this echo that i keep on hearing
p00216_B,00216,B,you heard me tell aziz and godbole i wasn t stopping in their country i didn t mean it so why did i say it i feel i haven t been frank enough attentive enough or something it s as if i got everything out of proportion you have been so very good to me and i meant to be good when i sailed but somehow i haven t been mrs moore if one isn t absolutely honest what is the use of existing
p00217_B,00217,B,oh yes that s true
p00218_B,00218,B,i don t believe in the hot weather people like major callendar who always talk about it it s in the hope of making one feel inexperienced and small like their everlasting i ve been twenty years in this country
p00219_B,00219,B,i can t get rid of it
p00220_B,00220,B,this sounds very romantic you meet a young man in a mosque and then never let me know
p00221_B,00221,B,dr aziz what s happened to your hills the train has forgotten to stop
p00222_B,00222,B,we aren t even seeing the other side of the world that s our complaint
p00223_B,00223,B,try seeing indians
p00224_B,00224,B,he isn t a bounder his nerves are on edge that s all
p00225_B,00225,B,i don t know he was all right when i left
p00226_B,00226,B,i m afraid i can t thanks all the same i m awfully sorry you feel i ve been remiss i didn t mean to be
p00227_B,00227,B,fancy if i d fallen or got angry
p00228_B,00228,B,say no more miss quested stops here i only wanted to be assured of your approval miss quested you had better send for your own servant if he can be found but i will leave orders with mine to do all they can for you also i ll let the scouts know they have guarded the college ever since it was closed and may as well go on i really think you ll be as safe here as anywhere i shall be back thursday
p00229_B,00229,B,i really can t see the harm
p00230_B,00230,B,i m sorry what s up
p00231_B,00231,B,oh well come along now and take your ladies away the catastrophe over
p00232_B,00232,B,i shall go round at once
p00233_B,00233,B,she stopped as she smokes by her own wish old man
p00234_B,00234,B,my old das is all right
p00235_B,00235,B,our schoolmaster government college
p00236_B,00236,B,you mean he s more frightened of acquitting than convicting because if he acquits he ll lose his job
p00237_B,00237,B,as if one could avoid seeing them
p00238_B,00238,B,but i want to see them
p00239_B,00239,B,i ve avoided excepting my own servant i ve scarcely spoken to an indian since landing
p00240_B,00240,B,oh lucky you
p00241_B,00241,B,even from one s patients
p00242_B,00242,B,that occurs after so many meetings
p00243_B,00243,B,what i mean is i was a nurse before my marriage and came across them a great deal so i know i really do know the truth about indians a most unsuitable position for any englishwoman i was a nurse in a native state one s only hope was to hold sternly aloof
p00244_B,00244,B,why the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die
p00245_B,00245,B,how if he went to heaven
p00246_B,00246,B,he can go where he likes as long as he doesn t come near me they give me the creeps
p00247_B,00247,B,as a matter of fact i have thought what you were saying about heaven and that is why i am against missionaries i am all for chaplains but all against missionaries let me explain
p00248_B,00248,B,do you really want to meet the aryan brother miss quested that can be easily fixed up i didn t realize he d amuse you you can practically see any type you like take your choice i know the government people and the landowners heaslop here can get hold of the barrister crew while if you want to specialize on education we can come down on fielding
p00249_B,00249,B,i m tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze it was wonderful when we landed but that superficial glamour soon goes i only want those indians whom you come across socially as your friends
p00250_B,00250,B,i don t think it ll really help me burra sahib
p00251_B,00251,B,i suppose he is guilty can i possibly have made a mistake
p00252_B,00252,B,drink it up not a bad notion a peg
p00253_B,00253,B,you won t
p00254_B,00254,B,you re bound to win
p00255_B,00255,B,well we don t come across them socially they re full of all the virtues but we don t and it s now eleven thirty and too late to go into the reasons
p00256_B,00256,B,you sent brandy down to the court didn t you mary
p00257_B,00257,B,i had gathered as much those drums are merely mohurram of course
p00258_B,00258,B,miss quested what a name
p00259_B,00259,B,harry is there any news from the city
p00260_B,00260,B,i should think i did champagne too
p00261_B,00261,B,sorry my dear take your time was your chhota hazri all right
p00262_B,00262,B,i fail to see how that last question can be termed a necessary question
p00263_B,00263,B,of course she won t she s a real sport
p00264_B,00264,B,they ought never to have been allowed to drive in it s so bad for them why they come at all i don t know they hate it as much as we do talk to mrs mcbryde her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck
p00265_B,00265,B,what do you want me to do oh those purdah women i never thought any would come oh dear i consider they ought to come over to me
p00266_B,00266,B,quite so not till monday
p00267_B,00267,B,really after mohurram a show of force will do no harm it s ridiculous to pretend they don t hate us do give up that farce
p00268_B,00268,B,i refuse to shake hands with any of the men unless it has to be the nawab bahadur
p00269_B,00269,B,everything absolutely normal
p00270_B,00270,B,india does wonders for the judgment especially during the hot weather it has even done wonders for fielding
p00271_B,00271,B,she s saying her prayers
p00272_B,00272,B,merely the preparations for it the procession is not till next week
p00273_B,00273,B,i don t hate them i don t know why
p00274_B,00274,B,i want to talk specially to the ladies not the least cause for alarm keep cool keep cool don t go out more than you can help don t go into the city don t talk before your servants that s all
p00275_B,00275,B,come along mary get it over
p00276_B,00276,B,will all ladies leave the smoking room now please and remember what i have said we look to you to help us through a difficult time and you can help us by behaving as if everything is normal it is all i ask can i rely on you
p00277_B,00277,B,do come quietly mary
p00278_B,00278,B,whom have we so far h m h m much as one expected we know why he s here i think over that contract and he wants to get the right side of me for mohurram and he s the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations and he s that parsi and he s hullo there he goes smash into our hollyhocks pulled the left rein when he meant the right all as usual
p00279_B,00279,B,i thought you were discussing the caves
p00280_B,00280,B,it s nothing to do with them that i
p00281_B,00281,B,dear old boy ronny she isn t ill too
p00282_B,00282,B,but she thinks it
p00283_B,00283,B,anyhow we ve not quarrelled ronny
p00284_B,00284,B,isn t the lesson that you should invite all the pleaders to have a smoke with you
p00285_B,00285,B,didn t she
p00286_B,00286,B,oh naturally
p00287_B,00287,B,what can i do to make things easier for you it s you who matter
p00288_B,00288,B,the marabar caves
p00289_B,00289,B,oh no ronny it has red bars on its wings
p00290_B,00290,B,i know but
p00291_B,00291,B,have you been to them
p00292_B,00292,B,but ronny i heard her
p00293_B,00293,B,good evening
p00294_B,00294,B,why not ask the pleaders to the club
p00295_B,00295,B,i thought there was to be no polo
p00296_B,00296,B,have i really
p00297_B,00297,B,yes he this is very very awful i m as certain as ever he followed me only wouldn t it be possible to withdraw the case i dread the idea of giving evidence more and more and you are all so good to women here and you have so much more power than in england look at miss derek s motor car oh of course it s out of the question i m ashamed to have mentioned it please forgive me
p00298_B,00298,B,not a bit
p00299_B,00299,B,i am counting on you to help me through it is such a blessing to be with you again everyone else is a stranger i know it s all nothing i must be sensible i do try
p00300_B,00300,B,but let us discuss things it s all so frightfully important we mustn t make false steps i want next to hear your point of view about me it might help us both
p00301_B,00301,B,my echo s better
p00302_B,00302,B,i don t know the animals any better than the birds here too big for a goat
p00303_B,00303,B,mrs moore your delightful doctor has decided on a picnic instead of a party in his house we are to meet him out there you myself mr fielding professor godbole exactly the same party
p00304_B,00304,B,quite so
p00305_B,00305,B,it would be so appalling if i was wrong i should take my own life
p00306_B,00306,B,now look here wouldn t you expect a mohammedan to answer if you asked him to take off his hat in church
p00307_B,00307,B,oughtn t we to get back to the bungalow
p00308_B,00308,B,the idea more than the words
p00309_B,00309,B,i know i don t and i want to what is the difference please
p00310_B,00310,B,i only want everything to be absolutely clear between us and to answer any questions you care to put to me on my conduct
p00311_B,00311,B,but ronny dear ronny perhaps there oughtn t to be any trial
p00312_B,00312,B,it s something very different nothing to do with caves that i wanted to talk over with you i ve finally decided we are not going to be married my dear boy
p00313_B,00313,B,when her voice dropped she said it towards the end when she talked about love love i couldn t follow but just then she said doctor aziz never did it
p00314_B,00314,B,we didn t skid we ran into an animal
p00315_B,00315,B,if dr aziz never did it he ought to be let out
p00316_B,00316,B,he s good i ve been so wrong to accuse him
p00317_B,00317,B,he did not if you had spoken to him we could have arranged them have i said anything funny
p00318_B,00318,B,i ll not have you worry her whether she s well or ill
p00319_B,00319,B,aziz aziz aziz have i made a mistake
p00320_B,00320,B,so am i i m useless at everything
p00321_B,00321,B,i suppose i can t how amazing of me
p00322_B,00322,B,i think we shall keep friends
p00323_B,00323,B,i suppose that there is nothing else it s unpardonable of me to have given you and your mother all this bother yes nothing else we ve been awfully british over it but i suppose that s all right
p00324_B,00324,B,help me to do what i ought aziz is good you heard your mother say so
p00325_B,00325,B,ronny he s innocent i made an awful mistake
p00326_B,00326,B,what animal
p00327_B,00327,B,a mohammedan how perfectly magnificent ronny isn t that like your mother while we talk about seeing the real india she goes and sees it and then forgets she s seen it
p00328_B,00328,B,that s it that s it i knew i d heard his name somewhere i am so grateful to you for clearing this up it s the sort of mistake that worries me and proves i m neurotic
p00329_B,00329,B,you re over tired
p00330_B,00330,B,by jove she s right the paint s gone
p00331_B,00331,B,so you won t go saying he s innocent again will you for every servant i ve got is a spy they all hate us it ll be all right after the verdict for i will say this for them they do accept the accomplished fact but at present they re pouring out money like water to catch us tripping and a remark like yours is the very thing they look out for it would enable them to say it was a put up job on the part of us officials you see what i mean
p00332_B,00332,B,mcbryde has an illustrated bird book i m no good at all at birds in fact i m useless at any information outside my own job it s a great pity
p00333_B,00333,B,simpler to drop the polo i won t have you messing about with indians any more if you want to go to the marabar caves you ll go under british auspices
p00334_B,00334,B,she never mentioned that name once
p00335_B,00335,B,pure illusion you can t be quite well can you to make up a thing like that
p00336_B,00336,B,no but i know all about them naturally
p00337_B,00337,B,well sit down anyhow
p00338_B,00338,B,never never my dear girl complete illusion his name was not mentioned by anyone look here you are confusing this with fielding s letter
p00339_B,00339,B,perhaps but time s limited and the flesh weak i prefer my smoke at the club amongst my own sort i m afraid
p00340_B,00340,B,i want you and mother at once there s to be polo
p00341_B,00341,B,so i am aziz was exquisitely dressed from tie pin to spats but he had forgotten his back collar stud and there you have the indian all over inattention to detail the fundamental slackness that reveals the race similarly to meet in the caves as if they were the clock at charing cross when they re miles from a station and each other
p00342_B,00342,B,i know we shall
p00343_B,00343,B,well i m blessed did he descend to any details
p00344_B,00344,B,are you too pledged to this expedition mother
p00345_B,00345,B,but i haven t got any questions you ve acted within your rights you were quite right to come out and have a look at me doing my work it was an excellent plan and anyhow it s no use talking further we should only get up steam
p00346_B,00346,B,who cares what she thinks
p00347_B,00347,B,not allowed
p00348_B,00348,B,everything s altered some soldier men have come in come along and i ll tell you about it
p00349_B,00349,B,i say adela what was it
p00350_B,00350,B,i thought she would want to give it no one blames you mother but the fact remains that you dropped off at the first cave and encouraged adela to go on with him alone whereas if you d been well enough to keep on too nothing would have happened he planned it i know still you fell into his trap just like fielding and antony before you forgive me for speaking so plainly but you ve no right to take up this high and mighty attitude about law courts if you re ill that s different but you say you re all right and you seem so in which case i thought you ld want to take your part i did really
p00351_B,00351,B,heard what
p00352_B,00352,B,our old gentleman is helpful and sound as he always is over public affairs you ve seen in him our show indian
p00353_B,00353,B,you were not right she never said it
p00354_B,00354,B,would half an hour s spin entertain you at all
p00355_B,00355,B,no but aziz would make some similar muddle over the caves he meant nothing by the invitation i could tell by his voice it s just their way of being pleasant
p00356_B,00356,B,i m afraid so incredible aren t they even the best of them they re all they all forget their back collar studs sooner or later you ve had to do with three sets of indians to day the bhattacharyas aziz and this chap and it really isn t a coincidence that they ve all let you down
p00357_B,00357,B,oh we had a small accident on the marabar road adela thinks it was a hyena
p00358_B,00358,B,out where
p00359_B,00359,B,oh that would have been too absurd why should we quarrel
p00360_B,00360,B,what was i warning you just now you know you re right and the whole station knows it
p00361_B,00361,B,it s different it s different you don t understand
p00362_B,00362,B,there s your ganges it s not much of a dead body that gets down to chandrapore
p00363_B,00363,B,you never said we should marry my dear girl you never bound either yourself or me don t let this upset you
p00364_B,00364,B,i don t quite know what you re saying and i don t think you do
p00365_B,00365,B,my temper s rotten i must apologize i didn t mean to order you and mother about but of course the way those bengalis let you down this morning annoyed me and i don t want that sort of thing to keep happening
p00366_B,00366,B,those words
p00367_B,00367,B,that s as you like but there s no hurry is there
p00368_B,00368,B,he was let out until the mohurram riot when he had to be put in again half a minute
p00369_B,00369,B,that s all right of course i forgive you as you call it but the case has to come before a magistrate now it really must the machinery has started
p00370_B,00370,B,i was only thinking how the worthy doctor s collar climbed up his neck
p00371_B,00371,B,certainly and i shall be there myself the case won t come before me they ve objected to me on personal grounds it will be at chandrapore we thought at one time it would be transferred elsewhere
p00372_B,00372,B,dear old girl to say so
p00373_B,00373,B,do you know what the name of that green bird up above us is bee eater
p00374_B,00374,B,mother never said so
p00375_B,00375,B,as we are british i suppose it is
p00376_B,00376,B,i don t much believe in this discussing besides i m so dead with all this extra work mohurram s bringing if you ll excuse me
p00377_B,00377,B,that s good you ll be perfectly well in a few days but you must save yourself up for the trial das is a very good fellow we shall all be with you
p00378_B,00378,B,but you ll find her irritable we are an irritable family well you ll see for yourself no doubt my own nerves are out of order and i expected more from mother when i came in from the office than she felt able to give she is sure to make a special effort for you still i don t want your home coming to be a disappointing one don t expect too much
p00379_B,00379,B,come along and let s tell the mater all this
p00380_B,00380,B,he called to you in the mosque did he how impudently what was he doing there himself at that time of night no it s not their prayer time so he called to you over your shoes then it was impudence it s an old trick i wish you had had them on
p00381_B,00381,B,i was listening to all she said as far as it could be listened to she gets very incoherent
p00382_B,00382,B,my duties here are evidently finished i don t want to see india now now for my passage back
p00383_B,00383,B,yes as mr mcbryde was saying but it s much more the anglo indians themselves who are likely to get on adela s nerves she doesn t think they behave pleasantly to indians you see
p00384_B,00384,B,red nine on black ten
p00385_B,00385,B,i don t think adela ll ever be quite their sort she s much too individual
p00386_B,00386,B,but my dear boy a private conversation
p00387_B,00387,B,why should i be in the witness box
p00388_B,00388,B,i have nothing to do with your ludicrous law courts i will not be dragged in at all
p00389_B,00389,B,ronny ronny you re never going to pass it on to major callendar
p00390_B,00390,B,i like aziz aziz is my real friend
p00391_B,00391,B,i want my pack of patience cards
p00392_B,00392,B,oh yes that s where i got to that s where i ve been
p00393_B,00393,B,rather small with a little moustache and quick eyes he called out to me when i was in the dark part of the mosque about my shoes that was how we began talking he was afraid i had them on but i remembered luckily he told me about his children and then we walked back to the club he knows you well
p00394_B,00394,B,oh yes i think so except the callendars he doesn t care for the callendars at all
p00395_B,00395,B,adela and i talk mostly about india dear since you mention it you re quite right you ought to be more alone with her than you are
p00396_B,00396,B,crocodiles down in it too how terrible what a terrible river what a wonderful river
p00397_B,00397,B,but my dear boy
p00398_B,00398,B,not talk about him why
p00399_B,00399,B,one knows people s characters as you call them i have heard both english and indians speak well of him and i felt it isn t the sort of thing he would do
p00400_B,00400,B,between the acts
p00401_B,00401,B,he didn t come into the club he said he wasn t allowed to
p00402_B,00402,B,a side issue a side issue how can it be that
p00403_B,00403,B,i ve never heard of these caves i don t know what or where they are but i really can t have so much quarrelling and tiresomeness
p00404_B,00404,B,i am all right as a matter of fact i have been looking at my return ticket it is interchangeable so i have a much larger choice of boats home than i thought
p00405_B,00405,B,your sentiments are those of a god
p00406_B,00406,B,oh how tedious trivial oh why is everything still my duty when shall i be free from your fuss was he in the cave and were you in the cave and on and on and unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and am i good and is he bad and are we saved and ending everything the echo
p00407_B,00407,B,ask her ask her yourself my dear boy
p00408_B,00408,B,i don t know what you mean dear
p00409_B,00409,B,and englishmen like posing as gods
p00410_B,00410,B,i m going to argue and indeed dictate the english are out here to be pleasant
p00411_B,00411,B,i think it was impudence but i don t know about a trick his nerves were all on edge i could tell from his voice as soon as i answered he altered
p00412_B,00412,B,pretty dear
p00413_B,00413,B,most feeble
p00414_B,00414,B,ah yes so the young man there said
p00415_B,00415,B,a doctor i don t know his name
p00416_B,00416,B,you never used to judge people like this at home
p00417_B,00417,B,a ghost
p00418_B,00418,B,how not true
p00419_B,00419,B,my body my miserable body why isn t it strong oh why can t i walk away and be gone why can t i finish my duties and be gone why do i get headaches and puff when i walk and all the time this to do and that to do and this to do in your way and that to do in her way and everything sympathy and confusion and bearing one another s burdens why can t this be done and that be done in my way and they be done and i at peace why has anything to be done i cannot see why all this marriage marriage the human race would have become a single person centuries ago if marriage was any use and all this rubbish about love love in a church love in a cave as if there is the least difference and i held up from my business over such trifles
p00420_B,00420,B,oh it wouldn t be the weather
p00421_B,00421,B,will you play patience with your future mother in law dear adela or does it seem too tame
p00422_B,00422,B,she has started the machinery it will work to its end
p00423_B,00423,B,yes quite after the first moment
p00424_B,00424,B,because india is part of the earth and god has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant to each other god is love god has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show it and he is omnipresent even in india to see how we are succeeding
p00425_B,00425,B,i suppose so i suppose so
p00426_B,00426,B,well they must gossip sometime let them gossip
p00427_B,00427,B,ralph and stella may be wanting to know when i arrive
p00428_B,00428,B,but she came out to be worried that s exactly why she s here she discussed it all on the boat we had a long talk when we went on shore at aden she knows you in play as she put it but not in work and she felt she must come and look round before she decided and before you decided she is very very fair minded
p00429_B,00429,B,i can t deny that what you say sounds very sensible but you really must not hand on to major callendar anything i have told you about doctor aziz
p00430_B,00430,B,an accident
p00431_B,00431,B,mother is pledged to nothing certainly not to this polo will you drive up to the bungalow first and drop me there please i prefer to rest
p00432_B,00432,B,what do you mean
p00433_B,00433,B,can t mother
p00434_B,00434,B,i have changed my mind
p00435_B,00435,B,oh so he told you that did he the major will be interested i wonder what was the aim of the remark
p00436_B,00436,B,nothing s private in india aziz knew that when he spoke out so don t you worry he had some motive in what he said my personal belief is that the remark wasn t true
p00437_B,00437,B,how do you make that out mother
p00438_B,00438,B,only if you have anything sensible to say
p00439_B,00439,B,there you go again mother i really can t explain every thing i don t want adela to be worried that s the fact she ll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly and all that sort of nonsense
p00440_B,00440,B,been there when
p00441_B,00441,B,to confirm certain points in our evidence
p00442_B,00442,B,if the major heard i was disliked by any native subordinate of mine i should expect him to pass it on to me
p00443_B,00443,B,there s no point in all this here we are and we re going to stop and the country s got to put up with us gods or no gods oh look here what do you and adela want me to do go against my class against all the people i respect and admire out here lose such power as i have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn t pleasant you neither of you understand what work is or you ld never talk such eyewash i hate talking like this but one must occasionally it s morbidly sensitive to go on as adela and you do i noticed you both at the club to day after the burra sahib had been at all that trouble to amuse you i am out here to work mind to hold this wretched country by force i m not a missionary or a labour member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man i m just a servant of the government it s the profession you wanted me to choose myself and that s that we re not pleasant in india and we don t intend to be pleasant we ve something more important to do
p00444_B,00444,B,so you and he had a talk did you gather he was well disposed
p00445_B,00445,B,people are so odd out here and it s not like home one s always facing the footlights as the burra sahib said take a silly little example when adela went out to the boundary of the club compound and fielding followed her i saw mrs callendar notice it they notice everything until they re perfectly sure you re their sort
p00446_B,00446,B,have you any evidence in the prisoner s favour if so it is your bounden duty to go into the witness box for him instead of for us no one will stop you
p00447_B,00447,B,yes rather i must in fact
p00448_B,00448,B,you can t go to england in may as you agreed
p00449_B,00449,B,i wish you had pointed him out to me i can t make out who he is
p00450_B,00450,B,but mother you can t do that sort of thing
p00451_B,00451,B,oh good gracious not a mohammedan why ever didn t you tell me you d been talking to a native i was going all wrong
p00452_B,00452,B,what i say we re out here to do justice and keep the peace them s my sentiments india isn t a drawing room
p00453_B,00453,B,and most inconsiderate to adela
p00454_B,00454,B,there s nothing in india but the weather my dear mother it s the alpha and omega of the whole affair
p00455_B,00455,B,she is certainly ageing and i ought not to be vexed with anything she says
p00456_B,00456,B,it s the educated native s latest dodge they used to cringe but the younger generation believe in a show of manly independence they think it will pay better with the itinerant m p but whether the native swaggers or cringes there s always something behind every remark he makes always something and if nothing else he s trying to increase his izzat in plain anglo saxon to score of course there are exceptions
p00457_B,00457,B,yes nothing criminal but there s the native and there s one of the reasons why we don t admit him to our clubs and how a decent girl like miss derek can take service under natives puzzles me but i must get on with my work krishna
p00458_B,00458,B,we re not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly
p00459_B,00459,B,you oughtn t to have answered
p00460_B,00460,B,yes perhaps but then people ld gossip
p00461_B,00461,B,feeble mother feeble
p00462_B,00462,B,who was he
p00463_B,00463,B,probably she s heard tales of the heat but of course i should pack her off to the hills every april i m not one to keep a wife grilling in the plains
p00464_B,00464,B,very well get them
p00465_B,00465,B,a doctor i know of no young doctor in chandrapore how odd what was he like
p00466_B,00466,B,india isn t home
p00467_B,00467,B,are you all right you appeared all right when i left
p00468_B,00468,B,he abused the major in order to impress you
p00469_B,00469,B,what do you want can you state it in simple language if so do
p00470_B,00470,B,what did i tell you i knew it last week oh how like a woman to worry over a side issue
p00471_B,00471,B,we can go into that later can t we
p00472_B,00472,B,quite so but meantime a trial is coming on and the notion of most of us is that we d better pull together and help one another through instead of being disagreeable are you going to talk like that in the witness box
p00473_B,00473,B,i meant generally did he seem to tolerate us the brutal conqueror the sundried bureaucrat that sort of thing
p00474_B,00474,B,i quite see that i suppose i ought to get off to my files now and you ll be going to bed
p00475_B,00475,B,when the animal runs into us the nawab loses his head deserts his unfortunate chauffeur intrudes upon miss derek no great crimes no great crimes but no white man would have done it
p00476_B,00476,B,i know that s so remarkable about her i suppose nothing s on her mind
p00477_B,00477,B,well we d better end this unexpected wrangle you appear to want to be left out of everything and that s enough
p00478_B,00478,B,i know
p00479_B,00479,B,in return please don t talk about aziz to adela
p00480_B,00480,B,there is plenty of time for all such plans how do you think our adela looks
p00481_B,00481,B,nothing no one hurt our excellent host awoke much rattled from his dreams appeared to think it was our fault and chanted exactly exactly
p00482_B,00482,B,india likes gods
p00483_B,00483,B,no really not in this country it s not done there s the danger from snakes for one thing they are apt to lie out in the evening
p00484_B,00484,B,she can think and fielding too but there s such a thing as evidence i suppose
p00485_B,00485,B,the lieutenant governor may be my very good friend but i give him no trouble and all is over but i can be a thorn in mr turton s flesh and if he asks me i accept the invitation i shall come in from dilkusha specially though i have to postpone other business
p00486_B,00486,B,mr mahmoud ali this is not wise
p00487_B,00487,B,mr mahmoud ali impossible a little roughness will not hurt the boy he needs discipline
p00488_B,00488,B,it is easy to sympathize at a distance i value more the kind word that is spoken close to my ear mr turton has spoken it from whatever cause he speaks we hear i do not see why we need discuss it further
p00489_B,00489,B,i do not expect i shall make myself cheap i do not see why we should make ourselves cheap i do not see why we should the invitation is worded very graciously till tuesday then gentlemen all when i hope we may meet in the flower gardens of the club
p00490_B,00490,B,we have not all your sweet nature nawab bahadur nor your learning
p00491_B,00491,B,they are callendar boasted so before the trial i heard through the tatties he said
p00492_B,00492,B,pepper civil surgeon said so they hope to destroy us one by one they shall fail
p00493_B,00493,B,you will make yourself chip
p00494_B,00494,B,mr ram chand the nawab bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation i think
p00495_B,00495,B,mr ram chand
p00496_B,00496,B,mr mahmoud ali
p00497_B,00497,B,you wanted something not picturesque and we ve provided it what do you think of the aryan brother in a topi and spats the great point to remember is that no one who s here matters those who matter don t come isn t that so mrs turton
p00498_B,00498,B,the educated indians will be no good to us if there s a row it s simply not worth while conciliating them that s why they don t matter most of the people you see are seditious at heart and the rest ld run squealing the cultivator he s another story the pathan he s a man if you like but these people don t imagine they re india
p00499_B,00499,B,i didn t mean that
p00500_B,00500,B,absolutely true
p00501_B,00501,B,all right i said don t apologize
p00502_B,00502,B,climb down indeed what incredible impertinence
p00503_B,00503,B,this isn t a purdah party
p00504_B,00504,B,please tell these ladies that i wish we could speak their language but we have only just come to their country
p00505_B,00505,B,i can t eat might i have a little brandy
p00506_B,00506,B,if i do break down it is of no consequence it would matter in some trials not in this i put it to myself in the following way i can really behave as i like cry be absurd i am sure to get my verdict unless mr das is most frightfully unjust
p00507_B,00507,B,i ll thank you this evening i m all to pieces now my echo has come back again badly
p00508_B,00508,B,but now we can talk how delightful
p00509_B,00509,B,it is not a headache it is an echo i am sure to break down
p00510_B,00510,B,but mrs turton
p00511_B,00511,B,oh really
p00512_B,00512,B,how about aspirin
p00513_B,00513,B,yes my dear child
p00514_B,00514,B,do kindly tell us who these ladies are
p00515_B,00515,B,you re superior to them anyway don t forget that you re superior to everyone in india except one or two of the ranis and they re on an equality is that what you wanted
p00516_B,00516,B,why fancy she understands
p00517_B,00517,B,oh yes they re english speaking
p00518_B,00518,B,and they re not coming to the burra sahib s bungalow either my dear and that s where you and your baby ll sleep tonight
p00519_B,00519,B,they pass paris on the way no doubt
p00520_B,00520,B,the shorter lady she is my wife she is mrs bhattacharya the taller lady she is my sister she is mrs das
p00521_B,00521,B,i believe that you have oh please it distresses me beyond words
p00522_B,00522,B,i wonder whether you would allow us to call on you some day
p00523_B,00523,B,all hours
p00524_B,00524,B,all days are convenient
p00525_B,00525,B,we shall enjoy it greatly it would be a real pleasure what about the time
p00526_B,00526,B,oh do you oh but if you do we shall find you gone
p00527_B,00527,B,tell us which you would prefer we re quite strangers to your country we don t know when you have visitors
p00528_B,00528,B,we leave for calcutta to day
p00529_B,00529,B,but you ll be in calcutta
p00530_B,00530,B,no no we shall not we expect you thursday
p00531_B,00531,B,no of course not we are not such people
p00532_B,00532,B,don t let it become too real or you ll die yourself that is the objection to meditating upon death we are subdued to what we work in i have felt the same temptation and had to sheer off i want to go on living a bit
p00533_B,00533,B,i ll see him first if you prefer
p00534_B,00534,B,he he has not been capable of thought in his misery naturally he s very bitter but let me conclude my analysis we are agreed that he is not a villain and that you are not one and we aren t really sure that it was an hallucination there s a fourth possibility which we must touch on was it somebody else
p00535_B,00535,B,i do not yet i believe that honesty gets us there
p00536_B,00536,B,what kind of illness that was my first thought the day of the arrest hallucination
p00537_B,00537,B,what madness there s supposed to be a riot on the police have struck no one knows what ll happen next why don t you keep to your own people
p00538_B,00538,B,you put it honestly anyhow
p00539_B,00539,B,where you like how should i know your arrangements
p00540_B,00540,B,but to go back to our first talk for i suppose this is our last one when you entered that cave who did follow you or did no one follow you can you now say i don t like it left in air
p00541_B,00541,B,i m rather a hermit you know
p00542_B,00542,B,i won t ask the city magistrate to bring you i know he ll be busy at that time
p00543_B,00543,B,you can t wander about like that where s the car you came in
p00544_B,00544,B,thank goodness that s over
p00545_B,00545,B,i suppose so
p00546_B,00546,B,you can t it s too late how are you to get round to the private entrance now come this way with me quick i ll put you into my carriage
p00547_B,00547,B,exactly the guide i often think so unluckily aziz hit him on the face and he got a fright and disappeared it is most unsatisfactory and we hadn t the police to help us the guide was of no interest to them
p00548_B,00548,B,heaslop is waiting for you i think
p00549_B,00549,B,owing to my work and so on i don t get up much to the club
p00550_B,00550,B,i wouldn t worry about that
p00551_B,00551,B,i fear not
p00552_B,00552,B,our letter is a failure for a simple reason which we had better face you have no real affection for aziz or indians generally the first time i saw you you were wanting to see india not indians and it occurred to me ah that won t take us far indians know whether they are liked or not they cannot be fooled here justice never satisfies them and that is why the british empire rests on sand
p00553_B,00553,B,i don t go to that length
p00554_B,00554,B,how could she have known what we don t
p00555_B,00555,B,i ought to feel grateful to you i suppose but
p00556_B,00556,B,she s an old lady
p00557_B,00557,B,and i do like you so very much if i may say so
p00558_B,00558,B,we english do
p00559_B,00559,B,a somewhat unlucky party aziz and old godbole were both ill after it too
p00560_B,00560,B,we will in england if i ever take home leave
p00561_B,00561,B,i know all about him i don t know him would you like him asked too
p00562_B,00562,B,if heaven existed
p00563_B,00563,B,i think so i have never felt more happy and secure out here i really do get on with indians and they do trust me it s pleasant that i haven t had to resign my job it s pleasant to be praised by an l g until the next earthquake i remain as i am
p00564_B,00564,B,very well miss quested will thursday suit you
p00565_B,00565,B,oh well i don t think a discussion between us is desirable to put it frankly i belong to the other side in this ghastly affair
p00566_B,00566,B,aziz was so fond of her too
p00567_B,00567,B,none why make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it
p00568_B,00568,B,quite a chance i have a scheme on now as a matter of fact
p00569_B,00569,B,let us go back to hallucinations i was watching you carefully through your evidence this morning and if i m right the hallucination what you call half pressure quite as good a word disappeared suddenly my belief and of course i was listening carefully in hope you would make some slip my belief is that poor mcbryde exorcised you as soon as he asked you a straightforward question you gave a straightforward answer and broke down
p00570_B,00570,B,i think he should come in this time do ask him to come
p00571_B,00571,B,not much at my age one s seldom amazed marriage is too absurd in any case it begins and continues for such very slight reasons the social business props it up on one side and the theological business on the other but neither of them are marriage are they i ve friends who can t remember why they married no more can their wives i suspect that it mostly happens haphazard though afterwards various noble reasons are invented about marriage i am cynical
p00572_B,00572,B,good bye miss quested
p00573_B,00573,B,or could it have been one of that gang of pathans who have been drifting through the district
p00574_B,00574,B,the telephone has been broken miss quested can t ring up her friends
p00575_B,00575,B,it ll get us to heaven
p00576_B,00576,B,i no longer want love
p00577_B,00577,B,can you remember when you first felt out of sorts
p00578_B,00578,B,not much
p00579_B,00579,B,i should be pleased but does mr heaslop wish it
p00580_B,00580,B,far better stop here than expose yourself to insults from that preposterous woman
p00581_B,00581,B,i did not intend to be rude i only meant it is difficult as we get on in life to resist the supernatural i ve felt it coming on me myself i still jog on without it but what a temptation at forty five to pretend that the dead live again one s own dead no one else s matter
p00582_B,00582,B,do you care to meet one or two
p00583_B,00583,B,write to me when you get to england
p00584_B,00584,B,i don t expect gratitude i only thought you might care to hear what i have to say
p00585_B,00585,B,i don t know
p00586_B,00586,B,of course this death has been troubling me
p00587_B,00587,B,do you not believe in heaven mr fielding may i ask
p00588_B,00588,B,i do so long to be alone she was my best friend far more to me than to him i can t bear to be with ronny i can t explain could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop after all
p00589_B,00589,B,how can that be
p00590_B,00590,B,i m glad for i like you let s meet again
p00591_B,00591,B,someone who was in another cave and followed me when the guide was looking away possibly
p00592_B,00592,B,do you find her preposterous i used to i don t now
p00593_B,00593,B,do you think that would be so what should have given me an hallucination one of three things certainly happened in the marabar one of four things either aziz is guilty which is what your friends think or you invented the charge out of malice which is what my friends think or you have had an hallucination i m very much inclined now that you tell me that you felt unwell before the expedition it s an important piece of evidence i believe that you yourself broke the strap of the field glasses you were alone in that cave the whole time perhaps
p00594_B,00594,B,does he tell me to come out to him
p00595_B,00595,B,and nasty
p00596_B,00596,B,much the best thing to be in this place
p00597_B,00597,B,yes ronny is always hard worked
p00598_B,00598,B,frightfully expensive in both cases
p00599_B,00599,B,i was not ill it is far too vague to mention it is all mixed up with my private affairs i enjoyed the singing but just about then a sort of sadness began that i couldn t detect at the time no nothing as solid as sadness living at half pressure expresses it best half pressure i remember going on to polo with mr heaslop at the maidan various other things happened it doesn t matter what but i was under par for all of them i was certainly in that state when i saw the caves and you suggest nothing shocks or hurts me you suggest that i had an hallucination there the sort of thing though in an awful form that makes some women think they ve had an offer of marriage when none was made
p00600_B,00600,B,i do so hate mysteries
p00601_B,00601,B,good bye mr fielding such an interesting afternoon
p00602_B,00602,B,let us call it the guide it will never be known it s as if i ran my finger along that polished wall in the dark and cannot get further i am up against something and so are you mrs moore she did know
p00603_B,00603,B,i think you need not be impolite to her as well as to her son
p00604_B,00604,B,i know i know and we never get down from it i envy you being with indians
p00605_B,00605,B,oh no it wasn t that they even gave up going to calcutta to entertain us we must have made some stupid blunder we both feel sure
p00606_B,00606,B,people whom i respect very much believe in ghosts my friend mrs moore does
p00607_B,00607,B,so do i
p00608_B,00608,B,far wiser of him i ought to have spoken myself but i drifted on wondering what would happen i would willingly have gone on spoiling his life through inertia one has nothing to do one belongs nowhere and becomes a public nuisance without realizing it i speak only of india i am not astray in england i fit in there no don t think i shall do harm in england when i am forced back there i shall settle down to some career i have sufficient money left to start myself and heaps of friends of my own type i shall be quite all right but oh the trouble i ve brought on everyone here i can never get over it my carefulness as to whether we should marry or not and in the end ronny and i part and aren t even sorry we ought never to have thought of marriage weren t you amazed when our engagement was originally announced
p00609_B,00609,B,because the dead don t live again
p00610_B,00610,B,but it has made me remember that we must all die all these personal relations we try to live by are temporary i used to feel death selected people it is a notion one gets from novels because some of the characters are usually left talking at the end now death spares no one begins to be real
p00611_B,00611,B,i was brought up to be honest the trouble is it gets me nowhere
p00612_B,00612,B,ought i to join them
p00613_B,00613,B,i have just settled my movements i shall go to the dak bungalow
p00614_B,00614,B,no more do i my experiences here have cured me but i want others to want it

p00616_B,00616,B,i shouldn t tell you in confidence of course so you can hand on all my remarks to your side for there is one great mercy that has come out of all to day s misery i have no longer any secrets my echo has gone i call the buzzing sound in my ears an echo you see i have been unwell ever since that expedition to the caves and possibly before it
p00617_B,00617,B,but i suppose you re not likely to do that yet
p00618_B,00618,B,mrs moore says he is so nice
p00619_B,00619,B,indeed it will and that morning we go to this indian lady s all the nice things are coming thursday

p00629_B,00629,B,so do i what does dr aziz say of me
p00630_B,00630,B,the guide
p00631_B,00631,B,when i came to tea with you there in that garden house
p00632_B,00632,B,i didn t ask him we are too much upset it s so complex not like what unhappiness is supposed to be each of us ought to be alone and think do come and see ronny again
p00633_B,00633,B,would it not interest you to hear my side
p00634_B,00634,B,why indeed
p00635_B,00635,B,you are very kind i should have said yes i think but i agree with mr hamidullah i must give no more trouble to you i believe my best plan is to return to the turtons and see if they will allow me to sleep and if they turn me away i must go to the dak the collector would take me in i know but mrs turton said this morning that she would never see me again
p00636_B,00636,B,perhaps it was the guide
p00637_B,00637,B,exorcise in that sense i thought you meant i d seen a ghost
p00638_B,00638,B,very very much indeed it s what i long for this party to day makes me so angry and miserable i think my countrymen out here must be mad fancy inviting guests and not treating them properly you and mr turton and perhaps mr mcbryde are the only people who showed any common politeness the rest make me perfectly ashamed and it s got worse and worse oh just what we wanted to hear and do you know doctor aziz
p00639_B,00639,B,i am not this false start has been all my own fault i was bringing to ronny nothing that ought to be brought that was why he rejected me really i entered that cave thinking am i fond of him i have not yet told you that mr fielding i didn t feel justified tenderness respect personal intercourse i tried to make them take the place of
p00640_B,00640,B,oh nancy how topping oh nancy how killing i wish i could look at things like that
p00641_B,00641,B,mother s looking forward to seeing you but of course she s old one mustn t forget that old people never take things as one expects in my opinion

p00665_B,00665,B,even if this so what prevents leaving a chit saying where you go farther away or mine will start out of sympathy it has been so rough and wild this afternoon it spoiled some most valuable blossoms in the club garden and had to be dragged back by four men english ladies and gentlemen looking on and the collector sahib himself taking a note but dr aziz i ll not take up your valuable time this will not interest you who have so many engagements and telegrams i am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when i was asked and where i was asked your absence i may remark drew commentaries
p00666_B,00666,B,cholera cholera what next what now who spreads such untrue reports about my patients i hear cholera i hear bubonic plague i hear every species of lie where will it end i ask myself sometimes this city is full of misstatements and the originators of them ought to be discovered and punished authoritatively

p00668_B,00668,B,i don t know
p00669_B,00669,B,the fault is entirely mine but i believe you i believe mohammed latif shall be severely punished for inventing this

p00672_B,00672,B,hamidullah liked them in england here we never look at them oh no much too careful let s talk of something else
p00673_B,00673,B,don t trouble i ll bike
p00674_B,00674,B,cyril i have had an idea which will satisfy your tender mind i shall consult mrs moore her opinion will solve everything i can trust her so absolutely if she advises me to pardon this girl i shall do so she will counsel me nothing against my real and true honour as you might
p00675_B,00675,B,in my usual health
p00676_B,00676,B,i can rest the whole day thanks to worthy dr lal major callendar s spy i suppose you know but this time it didn t work i am allowed to have a slight temperature
p00677_B,00677,B,of course not but the word exists and is convenient all men are my brothers and as soon as one behaves as such he may see my wife
p00678_B,00678,B,i thought you might end in england
p00679_B,00679,B,mrs moore miss quested our expedition is a ruin
p00680_B,00680,B,but you haven t children
p00681_B,00681,B,i have seen her but three times but i know she is an oriental
p00682_B,00682,B,sh my dear chap don t mention that part hundreds and hundreds of rupees the completed account will be too awful my friends servants have robbed me right and left and as for an elephant she apparently eats gold i can trust you not to repeat this and m l please employ initials he listens is far the worst of all
p00683_B,00683,B,i don t want to hear your long talks
p00684_B,00684,B,millions of paths my dear fellow

p00686_B,00686,B,but i always thought that englishmen kept their rooms so tidy it seems that this is not so i need not be so ashamed everything ranged coldly on shelves was what i thought i say mr fielding is the stud going to go in
p00687_B,00687,B,mrs moore did not mention that to me among her plans
p00688_B,00688,B,is she wealthy i depute you to find out
p00689_B,00689,B,why don t you marry miss quested
p00690_B,00690,B,no doubt major callendar has told you that i am shamming
p00691_B,00691,B,caring has nothing to do with it
p00692_B,00692,B,oh yes i remember an excessively aged lady but will you please repeat the name of her companion

p00700_B,00700,B,dinner this is most unlucky i forgot i have promised to dine with das

p00702_B,00702,B,i know nothing at all about the religion here i should never think of watching it myself
p00703_B,00703,B,one minute again
p00704_B,00704,B,cyril that boastfulness about travelling light will be your ruin it is raising up enemies against you on all sides and makes me feel excessively uneasy
p00705_B,00705,B,take mine take mine
p00706_B,00706,B,perhaps some day just now i see mrs moore and what s her name coming
p00707_B,00707,B,she would have wanted me if she was ill to attend her
p00708_B,00708,B,it is because you can say and feel such a remark as that that i show you the photograph it is beyond the power of most men it is because you behave well while i behave badly that i show it you i never expected you to come back just now when i called you i thought mr fielding no one can ever realize how much kindness we indians need we do not even realize it ourselves but we know when it has been given we do not forget though we may seem to kindness more kindness and even after that more kindness i assure you it is the only hope we can t build up india except on what we feel what is the use of all these reforms and conciliation committees for mohurram and shall we cut the tazia short or shall we carry it another route and councils of notables and official parties where the english sneer at our skins
p00709_B,00709,B,to those other children
p00710_B,00710,B,may i really mr fielding it s very good of you i like unconventional behaviour so extremely the fact is i have long wanted to meet you i have heard so much about your warm heart from the nawab bahadur but where is one to meet in a wretched hole like chandrapore when i was greener here i ll tell you what i used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way i said to myself how does mr fielding look this morning perhaps pale and the civil surgeon is pale too he will not be able to attend upon him when the shivering commences i should have been sent for instead then we would have had jolly talks for you are a celebrated student of persian poetry
p00711_B,00711,B,is it not strange i keep on forgetting she has left india during the shouting of her name in court i fancied she was present i had shut my eyes i confused myself on purpose to deaden the pain now this very instant i forgot again i shall be obliged to write she is now far away well on her way towards ralph and stella
p00712_B,00712,B,explain in detail
p00713_B,00713,B,do you contradict my last remark
p00714_B,00714,B,oh rather most helpful
p00715_B,00715,B,yes yes but you didn t contradict what i said so i thought it was true oh dear east and west most misleading will you please put your little rotter down at his hospital
p00716_B,00716,B,poetry let us discuss why poetry has lost the power of making men brave my mother s father was also a poet and fought against you in the mutiny i might equal him if there was another mutiny as it is i am a doctor who has won a case and has three children to support and whose chief subject of conversation is official plans
p00717_B,00717,B,i expected you to make such a reply you are a faithful friend shall we now talk about something else
p00718_B,00718,B,yes yes one minute
p00719_B,00719,B,i do not consider mrs moore my friend i only met her accidentally in my mosque a single meeting is too short to make a friend
p00720_B,00720,B,that s all very well but you spoke against morality also and you said you had come to take other people s jobs all that was very unwise this is an awful place for scandal why actually one of your own pupils was listening
p00721_B,00721,B,not the least i ll send an embrocation over to the guest house i heard you were settled in there
p00722_B,00722,B,let them sing it
p00723_B,00723,B,it is useless discussing hindus with me living with them teaches me no more when i think i annoy them i do not when i think i don t annoy them i do perhaps they will sack me for tumbling on to their dolls house on the other hand perhaps they will double my salary time will prove why so curious about them
p00724_B,00724,B,i ve not don t be ridiculous
p00725_B,00725,B,well this indifference is what the oriental will never understand
p00726_B,00726,B,most certainly i am not

p00731_B,00731,B,i see anything further to complain of because it is far better you put all your difficulties before me if we are to be friends for ever you do not like mrs moore and are annoyed because i do however you will like her in time
p00732_B,00732,B,not even mogul emperors showed mercy until they received an apology
p00733_B,00733,B,this evening will do for schoolmastery i should go straight to the minto now the cholera looks bad we begin to have local cases as well as imported in fact the whole of life is somewhat sad the new civil surgeon is the same as the last but does not yet dare to be that is all any administrative change amounts to all my suffering has won nothing for us but look here cyril while i remember it there s gossip about you as well as mcbryde they say that you and miss quested became also rather too intimate friends to speak perfectly frankly they say you and she have been guilty of impropriety
p00734_B,00734,B,what s that last sentence please will you teach me some new words and so improve my english let me put in your stud i see the shirt back s hole is rather small and to rip it wider a pity
p00735_B,00735,B,perhaps your letter never reached the minister in question

p00817_B,00817,B,it s all over the town and may injure your reputation you know everyone is by no means your supporter i have tried all i could to silence such a story
p00818_B,00818,B,it is quite natural about miss quested we were having an interesting talk with our guide then the car was seen so she decided to go down to her friend she ran to her friend i to mine and now i am with my friends and they are with me and each other which is happiness
p00819_B,00819,B,cyril you sometimes make a sensible remark that will do for poetry for the present let us now return to your english visit
p00820_B,00820,B,oh i beg your pardon i m sure the licentious oriental imagination was at work
p00821_B,00821,B,will she sign that
p00822_B,00822,B,oho the deccani brahman
p00823_B,00823,B,as what

p00825_B,00825,B,and there she lives in comfort you will enjoy seeing her dear me i ve got a headache this evening perhaps i am going to have cholera with your permission i ll leave early
p00826_B,00826,B,it has been i believe absolutely what you say and of that there need be no further question
p00827_B,00827,B,if the weather lifts we want to see your torchlight procession from the water this evening i wrote to godbole about it but he has taken no notice it s a place of the dead
p00828_B,00828,B,who on earth do you suppose i ve married

p00830_B,00830,B,aziz how monstrous
p00831_B,00831,B,because i have more or less come through without it i was thinking of telling you a little about myself some day if i can make it interesting enough the lady i liked wouldn t marry me that is the main point but that s fifteen years ago and now means nothing
p00832_B,00832,B,your unfairness is worse than my materialism
p00833_B,00833,B,if you want to reward me let miss quested off paying
p00834_B,00834,B,there ll be a general move at chandrapore
p00835_B,00835,B,willingly what subject

p00837_B,00837,B,then the guide came back to you
p00838_B,00838,B,miss quested will be greatly pleased i am glad you have seen her courage at last
p00839_B,00839,B,i do worry on your account i consider they have been impolite she had no right to dash away from your party and miss derek had no right to abet her
p00840_B,00840,B,how do you do aziz after all this time i heard you were settled in here i suppose a couple of stings don t signify
p00841_B,00841,B,an artistic and thoughtful little suburb of london

p00848_B,00848,B,i hae ma doots

p00850_B,00850,B,here s luck but chin chin i do refuse here s to india
p00851_B,00851,B,anyhow you want to rest
p00852_B,00852,B,exactly and no oars
p00853_B,00853,B,even mangoes can be got in england now they ship them in ice cold rooms you can make india in england apparently just as you can make england in india
p00854_B,00854,B,i am only going for a little time on official business my service is anxious to get me away from chandrapore for a bit it is obliged to value me highly but does not care for me the situation is somewhat humorous
p00855_B,00855,B,miss quested
p00856_B,00856,B,i shall not really be intimate with this fellow nor with anyone
p00857_B,00857,B,callendar doesn t trust anyone english or indian that s his character and i wish you weren t under him but you are and that s that
p00858_B,00858,B,it simply doesn t affect me spies are as thick as mosquitoes but it s years before i shall meet the one that kills me you ve something else in your mind
p00859_B,00859,B,i don t feel their absence i don t want them weeping around my death bed and being polite about me afterwards which i believe is the general notion i d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child other people can have children no obligation with england getting so chock a block and overrunning india for jobs
p00860_B,00860,B,who on earth is mr quested
p00861_B,00861,B,something that the hindus have perhaps found
p00862_B,00862,B,so she probably is but i can t marry her if i wanted to for she has just become engaged to the city magistrate
p00863_B,00863,B,it s the old mother s doing she was afraid her dear boy would choose for himself so she brought out the girl on purpose and flung them together until it happened
p00864_B,00864,B,many thanks
p00865_B,00865,B,are you making anything out of your life here
p00866_B,00866,B,have you a spare one
p00867_B,00867,B,that s a notion
p00868_B,00868,B,be quiet in the course of a long talk with miss quested i have begun to understand her character it s not an easy one she being a prig but she is perfectly genuine and very brave when she saw she was wrong she pulled herself up with a jerk and said so i want you to realize what that means all her friends around her the entire british raj pushing her forward she stops sends the whole thing to smithereens in her place i should have funked it but she stopped and almost did she become a national heroine but my students ran us down a side street before the crowd caught flame do treat her considerately she really mustn t get the worst of both worlds i know what all these will want but you mustn t listen to them be merciful act like one of your six mogul emperors or all the six rolled into one
p00869_B,00869,B,and when the whole world behaves as such there will be no more purdah
p00870_B,00870,B,it s difficult to explain i never really understood or liked them except an occasional scrap of godbole does the old fellow still say
p00871_B,00871,B,you know me by sight then
p00872_B,00872,B,i m sorry to say mrs moore s dead
p00873_B,00873,B,oh i wish you wouldn t make that kind of remark it is the one thing in you i can t put up with
p00874_B,00874,B,you re not offended
p00875_B,00875,B,yes that sounds sense
p00876_B,00876,B,however did you make such a mistake it s almost unbelievable i should think i wrote you half a dozen times mentioning my wife by name miss quested what an extraordinary notion miss quested is our best friend she introduced us but what an amazing notion aziz we must thrash this misunderstanding out later on it is clearly some devilry of mahmoud ali s he knows perfectly well i married miss moore he called her heaslop s sister in his insolent letter to me
p00877_B,00877,B,because not a soul s been near us since we arrived
p00878_B,00878,B,there is something in religion that may not be true but has not yet been sung
p00879_B,00879,B,not if you re wearing it yourself
p00880_B,00880,B,besides the ladies i am expecting one of my assistants narayan godbole

p00882_B,00882,B,who is in charge of the guest house
p00883_B,00883,B,the preposterous letter you allowed mahmoud ali to write for you

p00887_B,00887,B,bring das to me
p00888_B,00888,B,thanks for telling me that yes i must try and be more careful if i m interested i m apt to forget myself still it doesn t do real harm

p00894_B,00894,B,i have not heard of other children

p00899_B,00899,B,who do you want instead of the english the japanese

p00905_B,00905,B,i knew her so slightly
p00906_B,00906,B,you are so fantastic miss quested you won t treat her generously while over mrs moore there is this elaborate chivalry miss quested anyhow behaved decently this morning whereas the old lady never did anything for you at all and it s pure conjecture that she would have come forward in your favour it only rests on servants gossip your emotions never seem in proportion to their objects aziz
p00907_B,00907,B,if i do i do i shall survive it i travel light
p00908_B,00908,B,no you won t

p00937_B,00937,B,the sums mentioned at dinner when you all got so excited they would ruin her they are perfectly preposterous look here

p00939_B,00939,B,what s that
p00940_B,00940,B,is there a path off the top
p00941_B,00941,B,i can t explain because it isn t in words at all but why do my wife and her brother like hinduism though they take no interest in its forms they won t talk to me about this they know i think a certain side of their lives is a mistake and are shy that s why i wish you would talk to them for at all events you re oriental
p00942_B,00942,B,including knowing me
p00943_B,00943,B,i told you he s no good
p00944_B,00944,B,i m coming back this way and don t argue excuse manners but i don t know anyone s position send my carriage back any time to morrow if you please

p00946_B,00946,B,i ve stamped on my last collar stud
p00947_B,00947,B,she goes on and on as if she s at a lecture trying ever so hard to understand india and life and occasionally taking a note
p00948_B,00948,B,yes certainly you must let off miss quested easily she must pay all your costs that is only fair but do not treat her like a conquered enemy
p00949_B,00949,B,aziz you have forgiven me the stupid remark i made this morning
p00950_B,00950,B,no i d willingly tell you if i had
p00951_B,00951,B,you would have allowed me to see her
p00952_B,00952,B,not very listen to mine at the conference it was settled
p00953_B,00953,B,you are quite right in thinking that poetry must touch life when i knew you first you used it as an incantation
p00954_B,00954,B,to whom
p00955_B,00955,B,don t use such exaggerated phrases
p00956_B,00956,B,now what is the matter
p00957_B,00957,B,this really is the end and i gave her the final blow
p00958_B,00958,B,if i have time it will be strange seeing her in hampstead
p00959_B,00959,B,yes but the scale the scale you always get the scale wrong my dear fellow a pity there is this rumour but such a very small pity so small that we may as well talk of something else
p00960_B,00960,B,you little rotter well i m damned amusement indeed is it likely at such a time
p00961_B,00961,B,i don t know perhaps she might tell you she won t tell me she has ideas i don t share indeed when i m away from her i think them ridiculous when i m with her i suppose because i m fond of her i feel different i feel half dead and half blind my wife s after something you and i and miss quested are roughly speaking not after anything we jog on as decently as we can you a little in front a laudable little party but my wife is not with us
p00962_B,00962,B,all four
p00963_B,00963,B,oh your hindu friends will like that won t they
p00964_B,00964,B,oh i don t know her but she struck me as one of the more pathetic products of western education she depresses me
p00965_B,00965,B,let us discuss that to morrow morning
p00966_B,00966,B,you re five feet nine inches high
p00967_B,00967,B,what s happened
p00968_B,00968,B,plenty of indians travel light too saddhus and such it s one of the things i admire about your country any man can travel light until he has a wife or children that s part of my case against marriage i m a holy man minus the holiness hand that on to your three spies and tell them to put it in their pipes i can t be sacked from my job because my job s education i believe in teaching people to be individuals and to understand other individuals it s the only thing i do believe in at government college i mix it up with trigonometry and so on when i m a saddhu i shall mix it up with something else you might tell your servant to bring my horse he doesn t seem to appreciate my urdu
p00969_B,00969,B,nothing of the sort put your hat straight and take my arm i ll see you through
p00970_B,00970,B,gokul is the village where krishna was born well more or less born for there s the same hovering between it and another village as between bethlehem and nazareth what i want to discover is its spiritual side if it has one
p00971_B,00971,B,in the course of a long talk with miss quested
p00972_B,00972,B,away from us indians go to seed at once look at the king emperor high school look at you forgetting your medicine and going back to charms look at your poems
p00973_B,00973,B,we ll discuss m l at dinner
p00974_B,00974,B,hamidullah s right they are much nicer in england there s something that doesn t suit them out here
p00975_B,00975,B,they can t well move me down whatever their feelings
p00976_B,00976,B,it s often done so in the past
p00977_B,00977,B,it will indeed be arranged
p00978_B,00978,B,you are coming to dinner with me as arranged i don t stand this you are coming to dinner with me you come
p00979_B,00979,B,don t bother miss quested has cleared out at last
p00980_B,00980,B,but how i suppose the guide helped her
p00981_B,00981,B,we haven t discussed poetry for two seconds
p00982_B,00982,B,you see aziz the circumstances also the girl was still engaged to heaslop also i never felt
p00983_B,00983,B,well you hurt me by saying it good night
p00984_B,00984,B,he wants the past back too but not precisely alamgir
p00985_B,00985,B,as dismay and anxiety
p00986_B,00986,B,my proverbs are a penny saved is a penny earned a stitch in time saves nine look before you leap and the british empire rests on them you will never kick us out you know until you cease employing m l s and such
p00987_B,00987,B,when would you like the carriage
p00988_B,00988,B,but the way i said it must be cleared up i was unintentionally rude unreserved regrets
p00989_B,00989,B,what a shame you leave india so soon oh do reconsider your decision do stay
p00990_B,00990,B,you are absolutely unlike the others i assure you you will never be rude to my people

p00992_B,00992,B,she is not in chandrapore just now
p00993_B,00993,B,ah you have heard the name of akbar good hamidullah whom you shall meet will tell you that akbar is the greatest of all i say which makes hamidullah cry but babur always repented afterwards which makes the entire difference and akbar never repented of the new religion he invented instead of the holy koran
p00994_B,00994,B,yes indeed three
p00995_B,00995,B,perhaps it is a circular train and goes back to chandrapore without a break who knows
p00996_B,00996,B,good bye miss quested you ll jolly jolly well not forget those caves won t you i ll fix the whole show up in a jiffy
p00997_B,00997,B,on which my heartiest congratulations

p01004_B,01004,B,i always enjoy conversing about the moguls it is the chief pleasure i know you see those first six emperors were all most wonderful men and as soon as one of them is mentioned no matter which i forget everything else in the world except the other five you could not find six such kings in all the countries of the earth not i mean coming one after the other father son
p01005_B,01005,B,because my ancestors came down with him from afghanistan they joined him at herat he also had often no more elephants than one none sometimes but he never ceased showing hospitality when he fought or hunted or ran away he would always stop for a time among hills just like us he would never let go of hospitality and pleasure and if there was only a little food he would have it arranged nicely and if only one musical instrument he would compel it to play a beautiful tune i take him as my ideal he is the poor gentleman and he became a great king
p01006_B,01006,B,i thought we would eat this before our caves and breakfast after
p01007_B,01007,B,impossible take back such a terrible remark

p01016_B,01016,B,alamgir oh yes he was of course the more pious but babur never in his whole life did he betray a friend so i can only think of him this morning and you know how he died he laid down his life for his son a death far more difficult than battle they were caught in the heat they should have gone back to kabul for the bad weather but could not for reasons of state and at agra humayun fell sick babur walked round the bed three times and said and he did bear it away the fever left his son and came to him instead and he died that is why i prefer babur to alamgir i ought not to do so but i do however i mustn t delay you i see you are ready to start

p01030_B,01030,B,but i shall it s inevitable i can t avoid the label what i do hope to avoid is the mentality women like some women are so well ungenerous and snobby about indians and i should feel too ashamed for words if i turned like them but and here s my difficulty there s nothing special about me nothing specially good or strong which will help me to resist my environment and avoid becoming like them i ve most lamentable defects that s why i want akbar s universal religion or the equivalent to keep me decent and sensible do you see what i mean

p01047_B,01047,B,oh do you feel that dr aziz i hope you re not right there will have to be something universal in this country i don t say religion for i m not religious but something or how else are barriers to be broken down take my own case i don t know whether you happen to have heard but i m going to marry mr heaslop

p01064_B,01064,B,he has taken endless trouble to make a success of our picnic
p01065_B,01065,B,a mystery is only a high sounding term for a muddle no advantage in stirring it up in either case aziz and i know well that india s a muddle
p01066_B,01066,B,adela she s never been in a hurry in her life
p01067_B,01067,B,oh do you think so mr fielding

p01078_B,01078,B,he arrived at the european guest house perhaps at least possibly
p01079_B,01079,B,oh no

p01081_B,01081,B,never be angry with me i am as far as my limitations permit your true friend besides it is my holy festival
p01082_B,01082,B,no i should not quite say that
p01083_B,01083,B,oh no oh no
p01084_B,01084,B,did he since when
p01085_B,01085,B,mangoes mangoes

p01089_B,01089,B,miss quested professor godbole s sweets are delicious they will give you a real indian treat ah in my poor position i can give you nothing
p01090_B,01090,B,why did you not tell me your silence plunged me into a pretty pickle
p01091_B,01091,B,well why are they so famous we all talk of the famous marabar caves perhaps that is our empty brag
p01092_B,01092,B,they are immensely holy no doubt
p01093_B,01093,B,my dear young sir the pot and the kettle have you ever heard of that useful proverb
p01094_B,01094,B,it will be a great honour there is an entrance in the rock which you enter and through the entrance is the cave
p01095_B,01095,B,oh no not at all at elephanta there are sculptures of siva and parvati there are no sculptures at marabar
p01096_B,01096,B,oh that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets but has not miss quested visited our caves already
p01097_B,01097,B,no not large
p01098_B,01098,B,i may sing now
p01099_B,01099,B,something like the caves at elephanta
p01100_B,01100,B,no i ve not even heard of them
p01101_B,01101,B,are they large caves
p01102_B,01102,B,do describe them professor godbole
p01103_B,01103,B,we hear nothing interesting up at the club only tennis and ridiculous gossip
p01104_B,01104,B,your mother will return shortly sir there is but little to see at our poor college
p01105_B,01105,B,don t trouble to come mother we re just starting
p01106_B,01106,B,well i m the sun dried bureaucrat no doubt still i don t like to see an english girl left smoking with two indians
p01107_B,01107,B,what should have upset his precious nerves
p01108_B,01108,B,let him go
p01109_B,01109,B,really i have no names for schools in my head i can think of nothing but our poor aziz have you grasped that at the present moment he is in prison
p01110_B,01110,B,i ask you did he do it or not is that plain i know he didn t and from that i start i mean to get at the true explanation in a couple of days my last notion is that it s the guide who went round with them malice on miss quested s part it couldn t be that though hamidullah thinks so she has certainly had some appalling experience but you tell me oh no because good and evil are the same
p01111_B,01111,B,i am most frightfully cut up
p01112_B,01112,B,thanks so much what was that
p01113_B,01113,B,yes alas
p01114_B,01114,B,yes yes but your personal opinion here s a man we both like generally esteemed he lives here quietly doing his work well what s one to make of it would he or would he not do such a thing
p01115_B,01115,B,godbole is aziz innocent or guilty
p01116_B,01116,B,and similarly when suffering occurs and so on and so forth and everything is anything and nothing something
p01117_B,01117,B,well the expedition where that occurs can scarcely be called a successful one
p01118_B,01118,B,the news has not reached you yet i can see
p01119_B,01119,B,a name a name for a school
p01120_B,01120,B,you re preaching that evil and good are the same
p01121_B,01121,B,no there has been a terrible catastrophe about aziz
p01122_B,01122,B,yes yes
p01123_B,01123,B,oh yes oh no i do not expect an answer to my question now i only meant that when you are at leisure you might think the matter over and suggest two or three alternative titles for schools i had thought of the mr fielding high school but failing that the king emperor george the fifth
p01124_B,01124,B,no not exactly please according to our philosophy because nothing can be performed in isolation all perform a good action when one is performed and when an evil action is performed all perform it to illustrate my meaning let me take the case in point as an example i am informed that an evil action was performed in the marabar hills and that a highly esteemed english lady is now seriously ill in consequence my answer to that is this that action was performed by dr aziz it was performed by the guide it was performed by you it was performed by me and by my students it was even performed by the lady herself when evil occurs it expresses the whole of the universe similarly when good occurs
p01125_B,01125,B,so i saw at once on entering your office i must not detain you but i have a small private difficulty on which i want your help i am leaving your service shortly as you know
p01126_B,01126,B,i will explain in detail it was a religious song i placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden i say to shri krishna the god refuses to come i grow humble and say he refuses to come this is repeated several times the song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present hour which is the evening
p01127_B,01127,B,and am returning to my birthplace in central india to take charge of education there i want to start a high school there on sound english lines that shall be as like government college as possible well at present there is only vernacular education at mau i shall feel it my duty to change all that i shall advise his highness to sanction at least a high school in the capital and if possible another in each pargana the point the point on which i desire your help is this what name should be given to the school
p01128_B,01128,B,ah that is rather a different question from your previous one and also more difficult i mean difficult in our philosophy dr aziz is a most worthy young man i have a great regard for him but i think you are asking me whether the individual can commit good actions or evil actions and that is rather difficult for us
p01129_B,01129,B,that is for the court to decide the verdict will be in strict accordance with the evidence i make no doubt
p01130_B,01130,B,excuse me you are now again changing the basis of our discussion we were discussing good and evil suffering is merely a matter for the individual if a young lady has sunstroke that is a matter of no significance to the universe oh no not at all oh no not the least it is an isolated matter it only concerns herself if she thought her head did not ache she would not be ill and that would end it but it is far otherwise in the case of good and evil they are not what we think them they are what they are and each of us has contributed to both
p01131_B,01131,B,i cannot say i was not present
p01132_B,01132,B,oh yes
p01133_B,01133,B,yes a name a suitable title by which it can be called by which it may be generally known
p01134_B,01134,B,oh no excuse me once again good and evil are different as their names imply but in my own humble opinion they are both of them aspects of my lord he is present in the one absent in the other and the difference between presence and absence is great as great as my feeble mind can grasp yet absence implies presence absence is not non existence and we are therefore entitled to repeat come come come come but did you have time to visit any of the interesting marabar antiquities did you not even see the tank by the usual camping ground
p01135_B,01135,B,oh yes that is all round the college
p01136_B,01136,B,that is good then you saw the tank of the dagger dagger fell from his hand and to commemorate miracle he built tank
p01137_B,01137,B,but he comes in some other song i hope
p01138_B,01138,B,oh no he refuses to come i say to him come come come come come come he neglects to come
p01139_B,01139,B,what was that about caves
p01140_B,01140,B,my fault that i told him to come this way because the road s better mr lesley has made it pukka right up to the hills
p01141_B,01141,B,hallo nawab bahadur been watching the polo again
p01142_B,01142,B,let s go into this let s look for its tracks
p01143_B,01143,B,don t worry mr harris he saved us from a nasty smash harris well done
p01144_B,01144,B,well it s all over now tears are useless we had some luck butting that tree
p01145_B,01145,B,he may show you some aspect of the country i can t and he s a real loyalist i thought you might care for a bit of a change
p01146_B,01146,B,not at all
p01147_B,01147,B,wasn t the bridge we skidded
p01148_B,01148,B,what s the damage
p01149_B,01149,B,let me take you to the bungalow and first the little spin
p01150_B,01150,B,all over oh yes the danger is past let us smoke cigarettes let us do anything we please oh yes enjoy ourselves oh my merciful god
p01151_B,01151,B,exactly you wish to borrow this electric torch
p01152_B,01152,B,i have sahib i have
p01153_B,01153,B,despite my advanced years i am learning to drive man can learn everything if he will but try i do not do the actual steering i sit and ask my chauffeur questions and thus learn the reason for everything that is done before i do it myself by this method serious and i may say ludicrous accidents such as befell one of my compatriots during that delightful reception at the english club are avoided our good panna lal i hope sahib that great damage was not done to your flowers let us have our little spin down the gangavati road half one league onwards
p01154_B,01154,B,a smash sahib that would not have taken place had he obeyed and taken us gangavati side instead of marabar
p01155_B,01155,B,ah now i begin to understand
p01156_B,01156,B,how do you do
p01157_B,01157,B,a large animal rushed up out of the dark on the right and hit us
p01158_B,01158,B,i believe it was a buffalo
p01159_B,01159,B,by jove sir your lady is right
p01160_B,01160,B,you give me five minutes time i ll take you any dam anywhere
p01161_B,01161,B,frightened adela
p01162_B,01162,B,excellent a hyena mr harris
p01163_B,01163,B,i consider not to be frightened the height of folly
p01164_B,01164,B,an animal
p01165_B,01165,B,exactly too big for a goat
p01166_B,01166,B,of course i m right i saw its hairy back quite plainly
p01167_B,01167,B,nussu will bring you out some suitable dinner upon a bicycle i shall despatch him with all possible speed meanwhile repair my car
p01168_B,01168,B,sahib says hyena
p01169_B,01169,B,we ran into a hyena
p01170_B,01170,B,really i had no idea
p01171_B,01171,B,it s just a trick and they happened to pull it off now one sees why they had mahmoud ali just to make a scene on the chance it is his speciality
p01172_B,01172,B,we ve had a breakdown
p01173_B,01173,B,can you give us a lift
p01174_B,01174,B,i m afraid it s very upsetting for you
p01175_B,01175,B,well that s good
p01176_B,01176,B,how absolutely rotten
p01177_B,01177,B,mr heaslop how disgraceful dragging in your dear mother
p01178_B,01178,B,isn t it all queer
p01179_B,01179,B,but how putrid
p01180_B,01180,B,yes indeed
p01181_B,01181,B,not the least i don t mind it
p01182_B,01182,B,don t worry about me i m much better than i was i don t feel the least faint i shall be all right and thank you all thank you thank you for your kindness
p01183_B,01183,B,take me too
p01184_B,01184,B,i will sit in front
p01185_B,01185,B,i would scarcely call her wrong a native state a hindu state the wife of a ruler of a hindu state may beyond doubt be a most excellent lady and let it not be for a moment supposed that i suggest anything against the character of her highness the maharani of mudkul but i fear she will be uneducated i fear she will be superstitious indeed how could she be otherwise what opportunity of education has such a lady had oh superstition is terrible terrible oh it is the great defect in our indian character oh it is the duty of each and every citizen to shake superstition off and though i have little experience of hindu states and none of this particular one namely mudkul the ruler i fancy has a salute of but eleven guns yet i cannot imagine that they have been as successful as british india where we see reason and orderliness spreading in every direction like a most health giving flood
p01186_B,01186,B,heh what about me
p01187_B,01187,B,now what s all this i m not an omnibus i ve a harmonium and two dogs in here with me as it is i ll take three of you if one ll sit in front and nurse a pug no more
p01188_B,01188,B,i don t believe in these people letting you down if i didn t snatch like the devil i should be nowhere he doesn t want the car silly fool surely it s to the credit of his state i should be seen about in it at chandrapore during my leave he ought to look at it that way anyhow he s got to look at it that way my maharani s different my maharani s a dear that s her fox terrier poor little devil i fished them out both with the driver imagine taking dogs to a chiefs conference as sensible as taking chiefs perhaps the harmonium the harmonium s my little mistake i own they rather had me over the harmonium i meant it to stop on the train oh lor they always sack me before that happens and then i get another job the whole of india seethes with maharanis and ranis and begums who clamour for such as me
p01189_B,01189,B,then hop in i ve no notion who you are
p01190_B,01190,B,heh no what about my dinner i can t be left alone all the night

p01221_B,01221,B,forgive my mistakes
p01222_B,01222,B,it is good of mr fielding to condescend to visit our friend we are touched by this great kindness
p01223_B,01223,B,all illness proceeds from hindus
p01224_B,01224,B,don t talk to him like that he doesn t want it and he doesn t want three chairs he s not three englishmen rafi come here sit down again i m delighted you could come with mr hamidullah my dear boy it will help me to recover seeing you

p01227_B,01227,B,this is a great relief to us it is very good of you to call doctor sahib
p01228_B,01228,B,and how much illness there is in the city
p01229_B,01229,B,we are in some anxiety over him he and dr aziz are great friends if you could tell us the name of his complaint we should be grateful to you
p01230_B,01230,B,here he lies
p01231_B,01231,B,we know how busy you are
p01232_B,01232,B,rafi do you hear that now why do you stuff us up with all this humbug
p01233_B,01233,B,it is only my duty
p01234_B,01234,B,there is always illness and i am always busy it is a doctor s nature
p01235_B,01235,B,he progresses but not from diarrh a
p01236_B,01236,B,dr aziz dr aziz i come to enquire your hand also please some temperature
p01237_B,01237,B,yes that is true
p01238_B,01238,B,h morrhoids
p01239_B,01239,B,it is only a boy
p01240_B,01240,B,i think not much
p01241_B,01241,B,he has not a minute he is due double sharp at government college now
p01242_B,01242,B,even boys must learn
p01243_B,01243,B,it is not the end of time it is scarcely ten thirty ha ha gentlemen if i may be allowed to say a few words what an interesting talk also thankfulness and gratitude to mr fielding in the first place teaches our sons and gives them all the great benefits of his experience and judgment
p01244_B,01244,B,some he should remain in bed how is stomach how head
p01245_B,01245,B,exactly exactly you must apologize properly rafi i can see your uncle wishes it you have not yet said that you are sorry for the trouble you have caused this gentleman by your carelessness
p01246_B,01246,B,you attend professor godbole there perhaps we hope his diarrh a is ceasing
p01247_B,01247,B,worse than difficult wrong no indian gentleman approves chucking out as a proper thing here we differ from those other nations we are so spiritual
p01248_B,01248,B,that is no reason you should bring a charge against a doctor
p01249_B,01249,B,nor you the advantage of conducting their cases in the courts any longer
p01250_B,01250,B,your own son failing to pass the lowest standard i think
p01251_B,01251,B,oh indeed oh yes perhaps he has not the advantage of a relative in the prosperity printing press
p01252_B,01252,B,fetch my sais rafi there s a good chap
p01253_B,01253,B,well are you ill aziz or aren t you
p01254_B,01254,B,oh that is true how true
p01255_B,01255,B,does mr fielding think it s true
p01256_B,01256,B,quite so heaslop ought never to have let her go and he knows it shall we be off
p01257_B,01257,B,i guess they do i got in first
p01258_B,01258,B,none chuck em out
p01259_B,01259,B,it will come
p01260_B,01260,B,you go rather too far there the poor old lady s evidence could have had no value shout and shriek mahmoud ali as he will she couldn t see through the kawa dol even if she had wanted to only miss quested could have saved him
p01261_B,01261,B,don t complicate let the cards play themselves we re bound to win there s nothing else we can do she will never be able to substantiate the charge
p01262_B,01262,B,never mind she is not going to the dak bungalow
p01263_B,01263,B,but where is she to have her dinner where is she to sleep i say here here and if she is hit on the head by roughs she is hit on the head that is my contribution well miss quested
p01264_B,01264,B,good bye then my dear hamidullah we must drop the mr now give aziz my love when you see him and tell him to keep calm calm calm i shall go back to the college now if you want me ring me up if you don t don t for i shall be very busy
p01265_B,01265,B,mr amritrao have you considered what sum miss quested ought to pay as compensation
p01266_B,01266,B,it s a question i can t get my mind on to i m out here personally because i needed a job i cannot tell you why england is here or whether she ought to be here it s beyond me
p01267_B,01267,B,it depends what you call yes yes i suppose morality does decline
p01268_B,01268,B,not at all we were only discussing possibilities
p01269_B,01269,B,i have a better idea than that miss quested you must stop here at the college i shall be away at least two days and you can have the place entirely to yourself and make your plans at your convenience
p01270_B,01270,B,at once
p01271_B,01271,B,he has some news for you you ll find him on the verandah he prefers not to come in
p01272_B,01272,B,he s not annoyed and if he was what does it matter
p01273_B,01273,B,miss quested has been explaining a little about her conduct of this morning
p01274_B,01274,B,she died at sea
p01275_B,01275,B,think which true the world isn t dying i m certain of that
p01276_B,01276,B,well i don t believe in providence
p01277_B,01277,B,first and foremost the question of bail why drag in him though
p01278_B,01278,B,they might equally attack the dak bungalow
p01279_B,01279,B,gladly in a minute
p01280_B,01280,B,i m delighted to be here too that s my answer there s my only excuse i can t tell you anything about fairness it mayn t have been fair i should have been born i take up some other fellow s air don t i whenever i breathe still i m glad it s happened and i m glad i m out here however big a badmash one is if one s happy in consequence that is some justification
p01281_B,01281,B,love is of no value in a witness as a barrister ought to know but i see there is about to be an esmiss esmoor legend at chandrapore my dear hamidullah and i will not impede its growth
p01282_B,01282,B,the educated thoughtful people i should say so though they don t like the name the truth is that the west doesn t bother much over belief and disbelief in these days fifty years ago or even when you and i were young much more fuss was made
p01283_B,01283,B,yes definitely
p01284_B,01284,B,let us wait until the happy couple leave the compound clear they really are intolerable dawdling there ah well fielding you don t believe in providence i remember i do this is heaslop s punishment for abducting our witness in order to stop us establishing our alibi
p01285_B,01285,B,then excuse me again is it fair an englishman should occupy one when indians are available of course i mean nothing personally personally we are delighted you should be here and we benefit greatly by this frank talk
p01286_B,01286,B,it may be difficult to separate them from the rest
p01287_B,01287,B,ah ah has some evidence come
p01288_B,01288,B,she loved aziz he says also india and he loved her
p01289_B,01289,B,oh no we must hit with all our strength when i saw my friend s private papers carried in just now in the arms of a dirty policeman i said to myself amritrao is the man to clear up this
p01290_B,01290,B,really really need you have exposed mr fielding to this further discomfort he is far too considerate
p01291_B,01291,B,it was insulting of him not to come in
p01292_B,01292,B,at a crisis the english are really unequalled
p01293_B,01293,B,we hear sir that your mother has died may we ask where the cable came from
p01294_B,01294,B,well qualified indians also need jobs in the educational
p01295_B,01295,B,excuse the question but if this is the case how is england justified in holding india
p01296_B,01296,B,an interesting pastime but a lengthy one there are one hundred and seventy million indians in this notable peninsula and of course one or other of them entered the cave of course some indian is the culprit we must never doubt that and since my dear fielding these possibilities will take you some time don t you think you had better come out to the nawab bahadur s or i should say to mr zulfiqar s for that is the name he now requires us to call him by
p01297_B,01297,B,exactly but the responsibility there ceases to be yours
p01298_B,01298,B,a great deal has been broken more than will ever be mended still there should be some way of transporting this lady back to the civil lines the resources of civilization are numerous
p01299_B,01299,B,oh really mrs moore i m sorry
p01300_B,01300,B,ah yes mr fielding but when once an indian has been arrested we do not know where it will stop you are very good to greet me in this public fashion i appreciate it but mr fielding nothing convinces a magistrate except evidence did mr mcbryde make any remark when my card came in do you think my application annoyed him will prejudice him against my friend at all if so i will gladly retire
p01301_B,01301,B,perhaps the age of miracles has returned one must be prepared for everything our philosophers say
p01302_B,01302,B,the heat i suppose
p01303_B,01303,B,no no the existence of providence
p01304_B,01304,B,is it correct that most are atheists in england now
p01305_B,01305,B,ah it s all very well for you to speak like that but we have to live in this country
p01306_B,01306,B,then where is she to go we shall never have done with her
p01307_B,01307,B,i don t agree at all the idea is a thoroughly bad one there may quite well be another demonstration to night and suppose an attack is made on the college you would be held responsible for this lady s safety my dear fellow
p01308_B,01308,B,and those englishmen who are not delighted to be in india have they no excuse
p01309_B,01309,B,oh this is unbearable
p01310_B,01310,B,and does not morality also decline
p01311_B,01311,B,good bye my dear fielding and you actually are on our side against your own people
p01312_B,01312,B,but how then can you believe in god
p01313_B,01313,B,i don t believe in god
p01314_B,01314,B,oh that is true how true
p01315_B,01315,B,is it true mr haq i don t consider us spiritual we can t co ordinate we can t co ordinate it only comes to that we can t keep engagements we can t catch trains what more than this is the so called spirituality of india you and i ought to be at the committee of notables we re not our friend dr lal ought to be with his patients he isn t so we go on and so we shall continue to go i think until the end of time
p01316_B,01316,B,come along we tire the invalid in either case
p01317_B,01317,B,i quite understand
p01318_B,01318,B,godbole s pujah did it
p01319_B,01319,B,i don t know whether this suits you but anyhow you re safe
p01320_B,01320,B,master says keep near the ladies all the morning
p01321_B,01321,B,master told me to come
p01322_B,01322,B,well your ladies won t have you do get rid of him dr aziz
p01323_B,01323,B,mistress tells you to go
p01324_B,01324,B,you spick lie
p01325_B,01325,B,i will discuss philosophy with him
p01326_B,01326,B,merciful god
p01327_B,01327,B,i spick a lie oh jolly good isn t he a funny old man we will have great jokes with him later he does all sorts of little things he is not nearly as stupid as you think and awfully poor it s lucky ours is a large family but you get inside make yourselves at home yes you lie down excuse me now i must meet our other two guests
p01328_B,01328,B,that will be kind of you but the servants are even more important we must not convey an impression of disorganization it can be done and i expect you to do it
p01329_B,01329,B,we re monkeys don t worry mr fielding mr fielding
p01330_B,01330,B,it takes an hour to get there an hour to get back and two hours for the caves which we will call three the train back is at eleven thirty and you will be sitting down to your tiffin in chandrapore with mr heaslop at exactly your usual hour namely one fifteen i know everything about you four hours quite a small expedition and an hour extra for misfortunes which occur somewhat frequently among my people my idea is to plan everything without consulting you but you mrs moore or miss quested you are at any moment to make alterations if you wish even if it means giving up the caves do you agree then mount this wild animal
p01331_B,01331,B,aziz can i have a drink
p01332_B,01332,B,on what charge do you arrest him
p01333_B,01333,B,very well so we will come along aziz old man nothing to fuss about some blunder
p01334_B,01334,B,oh for god s sake dear fellow we re coming to mcbryde together and enquire what s gone wrong he s a decent fellow it s all unintentional he ll apologize never never act the criminal
p01335_B,01335,B,hullo some mistake
p01336_B,01336,B,don t answer me like that produce your warrant
p01337_B,01337,B,i am under instructions not to say
p01338_B,01338,B,dr aziz will you kindly come a closed conveyance stands in readiness that will compel me to use force
p01339_B,01339,B,ah thank god he comes
p01340_B,01340,B,sir they are my instructions i know nothing
p01341_B,01341,B,sir excuse me no warrant is required under these particular circumstances refer to mr mcbryde
p01342_B,01342,B,i shall certainly come sir and i am most grateful to you for all the trouble you have taken over me may i venture to ask where miss quested is
p01343_B,01343,B,with all deference sir i am not here to answer questions but to make a personal statement and i have concluded it
p01344_B,01344,B,i m excessively sorry sir i certainly withdraw it unconditionally
p01345_B,01345,B,oh no oh no no
p01346_B,01346,B,the news gave me a very great shock so i must ask you to forgive me i cannot believe that dr aziz is guilty
p01347_B,01347,B,may i conclude my statement
p01348_B,01348,B,may i make a statement sir
p01349_B,01349,B,are you speaking to me officially sir
p01350_B,01350,B,then she s mad
p01351_B,01351,B,oh no no but not aziz not aziz absolutely impossible grotesque
p01352_B,01352,B,if i may venture to say so no i make no reflection on the good faith of the two ladies but the charge they are bringing against aziz rests upon some mistake and five minutes will clear it up the man s manner is perfectly natural besides i know him to be incapable of infamy
p01353_B,01353,B,i want to leave the room but cannot while this gentleman prevents me
p01354_B,01354,B,oh no who lodges this infamous charge
p01355_B,01355,B,it is no good we all build upon sand and the more modern the country gets the worse ll be the crash in the old eighteenth century when cruelty and injustice raged an invisible power repaired their ravages everything echoes now there s no stopping the echo the original sound may be harmless but the echo is always evil
p01356_B,01356,B,that that is a repetition of your insult in an aggravated form
p01357_B,01357,B,she escaped by god s grace
p01358_B,01358,B,pray mr fielding what induced you to speak to me in such a tone
p01359_B,01359,B,may i ask whether you have taken over charge of this district one moment mr fielding you are not to go yet please before you leave the club from which you do very well to resign you will express some detestation of the crime and you will apologize to mr heaslop
p01360_B,01360,B,you have a right to hold that opinion if you choose but pray is that any reason why you should insult mr heaslop
p01361_B,01361,B,worse and worse appalling
p01362_B,01362,B,leave this room at once and i deeply regret that i demeaned myself to meet you at the station you have sunk to the level of your associates you are weak weak that is what is wrong with you
p01363_B,01363,B,i cannot pass that last remark you will withdraw it instantly it is the type of remark you have permitted yourself to make ever since you came to chandrapore
p01364_B,01364,B,i called you to preserve you from the odium that would attach to you if you were seen accompanying him to the police station
p01365_B,01365,B,it does indeed rest upon a mistake it does indeed i have had twenty five years experience of this country and during those twenty five years i have never known anything but disaster result when english people and indians attempt to be intimate socially intercourse yes courtesy by all means intimacy never never the whole weight of my authority is against it i have been in charge at chandrapore for six years and if everything has gone smoothly if there has been mutual respect and esteem it is because both peoples kept to this simple rule new comers set our traditions aside and in an instant what you see happens the work of years is undone and the good name of my district ruined for a generation i i can t see the end of this day s work mr fielding you who are imbued with modern ideas no doubt you can i wish i had never lived to see its beginning i know that it is the end of me that a lady that a young lady engaged to my most valued subordinate that she an english girl fresh from england that i should have lived i came down particularly on your account while poor heaslop got his mother away i regarded it as the most friendly thing i could do i meant to tell you that there will be an informal meeting at the club this evening to discuss the situation but i am doubtful whether you will care to come your visits there are always infrequent
p01366_B,01366,B,it is not a question of your feelings but of the wish of the lieutenant governor perhaps you will ask me whether i speak officially i do i shall expect you this evening at six we shall not interfere with your subsequent plans
p01367_B,01367,B,miss derek and the victim herself miss quested herself definitely accuses him of
p01368_B,01368,B,i had no idea that was in your mind
p01369_B,01369,B,wife indeed i know those wives
p01370_B,01370,B,i hardly think that would do surely
p01371_B,01371,B,city magistrate
p01372_B,01372,B,quite possible i m afraid when an indian goes bad he goes not only very bad but very queer
p01373_B,01373,B,yes one can t very well worry poor heaslop photographs of women ah
p01374_B,01374,B,it s no use ringing up them callendar settles a question like that of course you haven t grasped that she s seriously ill
p01375_B,01375,B,sort of all white thing the burra sahib would do we shall all have to hang together old man i m afraid i m your junior in years i know but very much your senior in service you don t happen to know this poisonous country as well as i do and you must take it from me that the general situation is going to be nasty at chandrapore during the next few weeks very nasty indeed
p01376_B,01376,B,you have never explained to me what s in your mind here why on earth do you want to see her
p01377_B,01377,B,but at a time like this there s no room for well personal views the man who doesn t toe the line is lost
p01378_B,01378,B,his own people seem in touch with him all right
p01379_B,01379,B,no she had got among some cactuses miss derek saved her life coming just then she was beginning to fling herself about she helped her down to the car miss quested couldn t stand the indian driver cried and it was that that put our friend on the track of what had happened they made straight for our bungalow and are there now that s the story as far as i know it yet she sent the driver to join you i think she behaved with great sense
p01380_B,01380,B,i couldn t worry her overmuch with questions she ll have plenty to go through in the witness box they don t bear thinking about these next weeks i wish the marabar hills and all they contain were at the bottom of the sea evening after evening one saw them from the club and they were just a harmless name yes we start already i heard some more from miss derek she is an old friend of us both and talks freely well her account is that you went off to locate the camp and almost at once she heard stones falling on the kawa dol and saw miss quested running straight down the face of a precipice well she climbed up a sort of gully to her and found her practically done for her helmet off
p01381_B,01381,B,no you don t see entirely he not only loses himself he weakens his friends if you leave the line you leave a gap in the line these jackals are looking with all their eyes for a gap
p01382_B,01382,B,a bit too finespun anyhow callendar won t hear of you seeing her i m sorry to say he gave a bad account just now he says that she is by no means out of danger i must put this report through now fielding
p01383_B,01383,B,what difference does that make
p01384_B,01384,B,innocence or guilt why mix yourself up what s the good
p01385_B,01385,B,how should you when you think of crime you think of english crime the psychology here is different i dare say you ll tell me next that he was quite normal when he came down from the hill to greet you no reason he should not be read any of the mutiny records which rather than the bhagavad gita should be your bible in this country though i m not sure that the one and the other are not closely connected am i not being beastly but you see fielding as i ve said to you once before you re a schoolmaster and consequently you come across these people at their best that s what puts you wrong they can be charming as boys but i know them as they really are after they have developed into men look at this for instance i am going through the contents they are not edifying here is a letter from a friend who apparently keeps a brothel
p01386_B,01386,B,well she tells her own story doesn t she
p01387_B,01387,B,no you may see him on a magistrate s order but on my own responsibility i don t feel justified it might lead to more complications
p01388_B,01388,B,that he followed her into the cave and made insulting advances she hit at him with her field glasses he pulled at them and the strap broke and that is how she got away when we searched him just now they were in his pocket
p01389_B,01389,B,have a look at them
p01390_B,01390,B,it ll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals he was fixing up to see women at calcutta
p01391_B,01391,B,i wouldn t keep you waiting good heavens you take precedence of any indian visitor of course i meant what s the good why mix yourself up with pitch
p01392_B,01392,B,how can i not
p01393_B,01393,B,she is in no state to see anyone besides you don t know her well
p01394_B,01394,B,how do you know that
p01395_B,01395,B,there was an echo that appears to have frightened her did you go into those caves
p01396_B,01396,B,possibly my wife might ask her that much
p01397_B,01397,B,those field glasses upset me for a minute but i ve thought since it s impossible that having attempted to assault her he would put her glasses into his pocket
p01398_B,01398,B,it s all a mistake
p01399_B,01399,B,i was afraid you ld say that i should very much like to
p01400_B,01400,B,that sounds comfortable
p01401_B,01401,B,i don t follow
p01402_B,01402,B,that s his wife
p01403_B,01403,B,he s sure to refuse it s all he exists for i only wanted to ask her whether she is certain dead certain that it was aziz who followed her into the cave
p01404_B,01404,B,so i have just told you
p01405_B,01405,B,on the off chance of her recanting before you send in that report and he s committed for trial and the whole thing goes to blazes old man don t argue about this but do of your goodness just ring up your wife or miss derek and enquire it ll cost you nothing
p01406_B,01406,B,i see what you mean
p01407_B,01407,B,well when he s done with them
p01408_B,01408,B,i suppose there s no possibility of my seeing miss quested
p01409_B,01409,B,was a guide not with her
p01410_B,01410,B,can i visit aziz
p01411_B,01411,B,i wish you wouldn t
p01412_B,01412,B,she is among people who disbelieve in indians
p01413_B,01413,B,oh good good one s got to breathe occasionally at least i have i mayn t see her and now i mayn t see him i promised him to come up here with him to you but turton called me off before i could get two steps
p01414_B,01414,B,i don t want to hear his private letters
p01415_B,01415,B,i know but she tells it to you
p01416_B,01416,B,to whom do i apply for an order
p01417_B,01417,B,oh no oh no no it ll be cleared up in five minutes
p01418_B,01418,B,did she say any more
p01419_B,01419,B,oh that ll do that ll do i dare say you have the right to throw stones at a young man for doing that but i haven t i did the same at his age miss quested really cannot be seen you do know that for a certainty
p01420_B,01420,B,i say he s innocent
p01421_B,01421,B,i feel that things are rather unsatisfactory as well as most disastrous we are heading for a most awful smash i can see your prisoner i suppose
p01422_B,01422,B,hardly at all but you see i believe she s under some hideous delusion and that that wretched boy is innocent
p01423_B,01423,B,he told me
p01424_B,01424,B,i saw one of them there was an echo did it get on her nerves
p01425_B,01425,B,but i wanted to ask her i want someone who believes in him to ask her
p01426_B,01426,B,why don t one think more of other people
p01427_B,01427,B,then they ve started
p01428_B,01428,B,mr mcbryde s down there disguised as a holy man
p01429_B,01429,B,any more questions necessary questions
p01430_B,01430,B,that s exactly the sort of thing that must not be said mrs callendar be more careful than that please in these times
p01431_B,01431,B,i well i
p01432_B,01432,B,is the where is he
p01433_B,01433,B,jail bail has been refused i hope callendar may be able to let us know how things are going before long
p01434_B,01434,B,and a jolly suggestion the army s got to come in sooner or later a special train was in his mind inseparable from troops this would never have happened if barabas hill was under military control station a bunch of gurkhas at the entrance of the cave was all that was wanted
p01435_B,01435,B,english no good native troops for this country give me the sporting type of native give me gurkhas give me rajputs give me jats give me the punjabi give me sikhs give me marathas bhils afridis and pathans and really if it comes to that i don t mind if you give me the scums of the bazaars properly led mind i d lead them anywhere
p01436_B,01436,B,exactly what i said the native s all right if you get him alone lesley lesley you remember the one i had a knock with on your maidan last month well he was all right any native who plays polo is all right what you ve got to stamp on is these educated classes and mind i do know what i m talking about this time
p01437_B,01437,B,don t start carrying arms about i want everything to go on precisely as usual until there s cause for the contrary get the womenfolk off to the hills but do it quietly and for heaven s sake no more talk of special trains never mind what you think or feel possibly i have feelings too one isolated indian has attempted is charged with an attempted crime act upon that fact until there are more facts assume every indian is an angel
p01438_B,01438,B,and the major brings us an excellent report of miss quested
p01439_B,01439,B,mr fielding what has prevented you from standing up
p01440_B,01440,B,how s the old lady
p01441_B,01441,B,why should it
p01442_B,01442,B,does anyone here present want to
p01443_B,01443,B,squat down callendar tell us all about it
p01444_B,01444,B,sorry old man
p01445_B,01445,B,so she may be i guarantee nothing i really can t be plagued with questions lesley
p01446_B,01446,B,oh nothing i only heard a rumour that a certain member here present has been seeing the prisoner this afternoon you can t run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at least not in this country
p01447_B,01447,B,swine i should think so and what s more i ll tell you what what s happened is a damn good thing really barring of course its application to present company it ll make them squeal and it s time they did squeal i ve put the fear of god into them at the hospital anyhow you should see the grandson of our so called leading loyalist his beauty s gone five upper teeth two lower and a nostril old panna lal brought him the looking glass yesterday and he blubbered i laughed i laughed i tell you and so would you that used to be one of these buck niggers i thought now he s all septic damn him blast his soul er i believe he was unspeakably immoral er i wish i d had the cutting up of my late assistant too nothing s too bad for these people
p01448_B,01448,B,take me some time to do that
p01449_B,01449,B,heaslop s just behind me
p01450_B,01450,B,no one blames you my dear callendar we are all to blame in the sense that we ought to have seen the expedition was insufficiently guaranteed and stopped it i knew about it myself we lent our car this morning to take the ladies to the station we are all implicated in that sense but not an atom of blame attaches to you personally
p01451_B,01451,B,no what about him
p01452_B,01452,B,go on mr das we are not here to disturb you
p01453_B,01453,B,hi my patient can t be left unattended
p01454_B,01454,B,i don t feel that i wish i could responsibility is a very awful thing and i ve no use for the man who shirks it heard about miss quested s servant
p01455_B,01455,B,heaslop warned miss quested s servant last night never to lose sight of her prisoner got hold of this and managed to leave him behind bribed him heaslop has just found out the whole story with names and sums a well known pimp to those people gave the money mohammed latif by name so much for the servant what about the englishman our friend here how did they get rid of him money again oh i m being misunderstood apologies i didn t mean they bribed mr fielding
p01456_B,01456,B,i do i do i m satisfied
p01457_B,01457,B,that s ridiculous
p01458_B,01458,B,then what do you mean
p01459_B,01459,B,heaslop also found out something from his mother aziz paid a herd of natives to suffocate her in a cave that was the end of her or would have been only she got out nicely planned wasn t it neat then he could go on with the girl he and she and a guide provided by the same mohammed latif guide now can t be found pretty it s not the time for sitting down it s the time for action call in the troops and clear the bazaars i suppose nothing that s said inside the club will go outside the club
p01460_B,01460,B,they paid the other indian to make you late godbole he was saying his prayers i know those prayers
p01461_B,01461,B,oh please please all sit down i only want to listen what has been decided
p01462_B,01462,B,how is your mother old boy
p01463_B,01463,B,heaslop i m telling them i m against any show of force i don t know whether you will feel as i do but that is how i am situated when the verdict is obtained it will be another matter
p01464_B,01464,B,better thank you i wish everyone would sit down
p01465_B,01465,B,you are sure to know best i have no experience burra sahib
p01466_B,01466,B,some have never got up
p01467_B,01467,B,das is really
p01468_B,01468,B,you thought badly of her earlier did you not major that s why i refused bail
p01469_B,01469,B,not one of them s all right
p01470_B,01470,B,heaslop heaslop next time bail s wanted ring up the old doctor before giving it his shoulders are broad and speaking in the strictest confidence don t take the old doctor s opinion too seriously he s a blithering idiot we can always leave it at that but he ll do the little he can towards keeping in quod the oh but he has one of his friends here
p01471_B,01471,B,stand up you swine
p01472_B,01472,B,you have not answered my question why did you not stand when mr heaslop entered
p01473_B,01473,B,that s your way of putting it but a man can be a crank without being a cad miss quested had better know how he behaved to you if you don t tell her somebody else will he is now the mainstay of the defence i needn t add he is the one righteous englishman in a horde of tyrants he receives deputations from the bazaar and they all chew betel nut and smear one another s hands with scent it is not easy to enter into the mind of such a man his students are on strike out of enthusiasm for him they won t learn their lessons if it weren t for fielding one would never have had the mohurram trouble he has done a very grave disservice to the whole community the letter lay here a day or two waiting till you were well enough then the situation got so grave that i decided to open it in case it was useful to us
p01474_B,01474,B,miss quested realizes what all that means though the case will come before das
p01475_B,01475,B,the most wonderfully shaped of those hills yes no one else was present to my knowledge we appeared to be alone
p01476_B,01476,B,i must come before someone
p01477_B,01477,B,would that i had but think of his behaviour to you ronny when you had already to bear so much for my sake it was shocking of him my dear how can i repay you how can one repay when one has nothing to give what is the use of personal relationships when everyone brings less and less to them i feel we ought all to go back into the desert for centuries and try and get good i want to begin at the beginning all the things i thought i d learnt are just a hindrance they re not knowledge at all i m not fit for personal relationships well let s go let s go of course mr fielding s letter doesn t count he can think and write what he likes only he shouldn t have been rude to you when you had so much to bear that s what matters i don t want your arm i m a magnificent walker so don t touch me please
p01478_B,01478,B,i cannot be sure
p01479_B,01479,B,may i have half a minute before i reply to that mr mcbryde
p01480_B,01480,B,that is quite correct
p01481_B,01481,B,i m afraid i have made a mistake
p01482_B,01482,B,is it
p01483_B,01483,B,i do this less every day i shall soon be quite well what i need is something to do that is why i keep on with this ridiculous crying
p01484_B,01484,B,i know where you mean
p01485_B,01485,B,dr aziz never followed me into the cave
p01486_B,01486,B,why should he write to me
p01487_B,01487,B,that s that s the way to face it you have the pluck miss quested the fruits of democracy
p01488_B,01488,B,very well there is a ledge half way up the hill or broken ground rather with caves scattered near the beginning of a nullah
p01489_B,01489,B,you went alone into one of those caves
p01490_B,01490,B,i beg your pardon
p01491_B,01491,B,i didn t catch that answer you are on that landing or whatever we term it and you have entered a cave i suggest to you that the prisoner followed you what do you mean please
p01492_B,01492,B,what nature of mistake
p01493_B,01493,B,not at all he only has the impertinence to suggest you have made a mistake
p01494_B,01494,B,it s not ridiculous we think you wonderful it only bothers us that we can t help you more your stopping here at such a time is the greatest honour this house by the way a letter came here for you while you were ill i opened it which is a strange confession to make will you forgive me the circumstances are peculiar it is from fielding
p01495_B,01495,B,and the prisoner followed you
p01496_B,01496,B,now miss quested let us go on i will read you the words of the deposition which you signed two hours later in my bungalow
p01497_B,01497,B,a most lamentable thing has happened the defence got hold of him
p01498_B,01498,B,he s a crank a crank
p01499_B,01499,B,oh we must help one another we must take the rough with the smooth
p01500_B,01500,B,in fact you disapprove of the appeal i forwarded to lady mellanby pray don t apologize mr heaslop i am accustomed to being in the wrong
p01501_B,01501,B,those swine are always on the look out for a grievance
p01502_B,01502,B,exactly and remember it afterwards you men you re weak weak weak why they ought to crawl from here to the caves on their hands and knees whenever an englishwoman s in sight they oughtn t to be spoken to they ought to be spat at they ought to be ground into the dust we ve been far too kind with our bridge parties and the rest weak weak
p01503_B,01503,B,at last some sense is being talked
p01504_B,01504,B,thoroughly desirable change for several reasons right mcbryde go ahead now sorry to have interrupted you
p01505_B,01505,B,that s what i say i say there s not such a thing as cruelty after a thing like this
p01506_B,01506,B,turn that man out
p01507_B,01507,B,do you feel faint adela
p01508_B,01508,B,i shall be happy to accommodate miss quested with a chair up here in view of the particular circumstances of her health
p01509_B,01509,B,do you object to the civil surgeon remaining mr amritrao
p01510_B,01510,B,you withdraw the charge answer me
p01511_B,01511,B,that s better
p01512_B,01512,B,are you all right yourselves
p01513_B,01513,B,now we ve got im
p01514_B,01514,B,we shall do we shall do
p01515_B,01515,B,oh cut the cackle and let s have the verdict
p01516_B,01516,B,well done das quite sound
p01517_B,01517,B,exactly sir he must but we had just learnt that mrs moore had important evidence which she desired to give she was hurried out of the country by her son before she could give it and this unhinged mr mahmoud ali coming as it does upon an attempt to intimidate our only other european witness mr fielding mr mahmoud ali would have said nothing had not mrs moore been claimed as a witness by the police
p01518_B,01518,B,i should object a platform confers authority
p01519_B,01519,B,even when it s one foot high so come along all
p01520_B,01520,B,well i withdraw my reference i would have done so fifteen minutes ago if i had been given the chance she is not of the least importance to me
p01521_B,01521,B,are you mad
p01522_B,01522,B,give me time to consider
p01523_B,01523,B,prisoner s dupes
p01524_B,01524,B,the prisoner and the guide took you on to the kawa dol no one else being present
p01525_B,01525,B,in which cave is the offence alleged the buddhist or the jain
p01526_B,01526,B,yes sir then in which jain cave
p01527_B,01527,B,you don t because you can t you have smuggled her out of the country she is mrs moore she would have proved his innocence she was on our side she was poor indians friend
p01528_B,01528,B,you will have an opportunity of putting such questions later mr lesley says they re buddhist and he ought to know if anyone does but may i call attention to the shape i have nothing to add at present i will now call my witnesses the facts will speak for themselves the prisoner is one of those individuals who have led a double life i dare say his degeneracy gained upon him gradually he has been very cunning at concealing as is usual with the type and pretending to be a respectable member of society getting a government position even he is now entirely vicious and beyond redemption i am afraid he behaved most cruelly most brutally to another of his guests another english lady in order to get rid of her and leave him free for his crime he crushed her into a cave among his servants however that is by the way i don t propose to call her
p01529_B,01529,B,all the marabar caves are jain
p01530_B,01530,B,you could have called her yourself neither side called her neither must quote her as evidence
p01531_B,01531,B,this is no way to defend your case
p01532_B,01532,B,mr mahmoud ali i have already warned you and unless you sit down i shall exercise my authority
p01533_B,01533,B,she was kept from us until too late i learn too late this is english justice here is your british raj give us back mrs moore for five minutes only and she will save my friend she will save the name of his sons don t rule her out mr das take back those words as you yourself are a father tell me where they have put her oh mrs moore
p01534_B,01534,B,i am not defending a case nor are you trying one we are both of us slaves
p01535_B,01535,B,do so this trial is a farce i am going aziz aziz farewell for ever
p01536_B,01536,B,if the point is of any interest my mother should have reached aden
p01537_B,01537,B,imprisoned by you there because she knew the truth i ruin my career no matter we are all to be ruined one by one
p01538_B,01538,B,mr mahmoud ali will have to apologize in person
p01539_B,01539,B,an extraneous element is being introduced into the case i must repeat that as a witness mrs moore does not exist neither you mr amritrao nor mr mcbryde you have any right to surmise what that lady would have said she is not here and consequently she can say nothing
p01540_B,01540,B,i am afraid my powers do not extend so far
p01541_B,01541,B,i have already withdrawn it for the defence perhaps you can persuade the gentlemen outside to withdraw it too
p01542_B,01542,B,excuse me mr mcbryde you cannot go on i am speaking to the witness myself and the public will be silent if it continues to talk i have the court cleared miss quested address your remarks to me who am the magistrate in charge of the case and realize their extreme gravity remember you speak on oath miss quested
p01543_B,01543,B,don t question her sir you have no longer the right
p01544_B,01544,B,the prisoner is released without one stain on his character the question of costs will be decided elsewhere
p01545_B,01545,B,i withdraw everything
p01546_B,01546,B,dr aziz never
p01547_B,01547,B,i stop these proceedings on medical grounds
p01548_B,01548,B,enough sit down mr mcbryde do you wish to continue in the face of this
p01549_B,01549,B,sahib you will have to withdraw this becomes a scandal
p01550_B,01550,B,he shall not call the other witnesses we re none of us safe
p01551_B,01551,B,right i withdraw
p01552_B,01552,B,what do you want here where are you going miss quested
p01553_B,01553,B,i don t want the rubbish get out
p01554_B,01554,B,no sir this is an honour for us
p01555_B,01555,B,sir i am a horse we shall be your horses
p01556_B,01556,B,cyril again you desert
p01557_B,01557,B,they are not i will not have my grandson made an excuse for an attack on the hospital
p01558_B,01558,B,quite so i have given trouble enough
p01559_B,01559,B,will you ask him what he wants mr fielding
p01560_B,01560,B,perfectly right
p01561_B,01561,B,it must have seemed a miracle to the onlookers the fact is that i realized before it was too late that i had made a mistake and had just enough presence of mind to say so that is all my extraordinary conduct amounts to
p01562_B,01562,B,at last
p01563_B,01563,B,but she died on leaving bombay she was dead when they called her name this morning she must have been buried at sea
p01564_B,01564,B,all it amounts to indeed speaking as a private individual in a purely informal conversation i admired your conduct and i was delighted when our warm hearted students garlanded you but like mr fielding i am surprised indeed surprise is too weak a word i see you drag my best friend into the dirt damage his health and ruin his prospects in a way you cannot conceive owing to your ignorance of our society and religion and then suddenly you get up in the witness box am i mad i keep asking myself is it a dream and if so when did it start and without doubt it is a dream that has not yet finished for i gather you have not done with us yet and it is now the turn of the poor old guide who conducted you round the caves
p01565_B,01565,B,not the turtons i thought you were their guest
p01566_B,01566,B,well here s our solution here comes the city magistrate he comes in a third class band ghari for purposes of disguise he comes unattended but here comes the city magistrate
p01567_B,01567,B,it is clearly to be understood sir that neither mr fielding nor any of us are responsible for this lady s safety at government college
p01568_B,01568,B,he comes he comes he comes i cringe i tremble
p01569_B,01569,B,do you hear the lady admits it herself it s not an attack from our people i fear you should see their orderly conduct at the hospital what we must guard against is an attack secretly arranged by the police for the purpose of discrediting you mcbryde keeps plenty of roughs for this purpose and this would be the very opportunity for him
p01570_B,01570,B,he wants you of course
p01571_B,01571,B,whether he tells you or not you will go i think
p01572_B,01572,B,twenty thousand rupees
p01573_B,01573,B,aziz are you awake
p01574_B,01574,B,i see
p01575_B,01575,B,there was not but there may be when you have written a poem you are our hero the whole city is behind you irrespective of creed
p01576_B,01576,B,happy the man who can compose both
p01577_B,01577,B,i know you bear me a grudge for trying that case you are so kind and friendly but always i detect irony beneath your manner
p01578_B,01578,B,it is not for hindus but indians generally
p01579_B,01579,B,i fear not and for that reason if i may say so do not introduce too many persian expressions into the poem and not too much about the bulbul
p01580_B,01580,B,professor godbole often mentioned it before his departure for mau
p01581_B,01581,B,he too was a poet do you not divine each other
p01582_B,01582,B,there is no such person in existence as the general indian
p01583_B,01583,B,i know but will it last
p01584_B,01584,B,you are full of compliments to day
p01585_B,01585,B,my great mistake has been taking our rulers as a joke
p01586_B,01586,B,no no what nonsense excellent
p01587_B,01587,B,half a sec here you are is not this better than a poem
p01588_B,01588,B,oh well about this poem how did you hear i sometimes scribbled
p01589_B,01589,B,how did he hear
p01590_B,01590,B,one old englishwoman and one little little wasp it does not seem much still it is more than i am myself
p01591_B,01591,B,put powdered glass in their pan
p01592_B,01592,B,ahmed come here for such wickedness
p01593_B,01593,B,i m only ralph moore
p01594_B,01594,B,quested quested don t you know that my wife was mrs moore s daughter perhaps this explains your odd attitude
p01595_B,01595,B,no pain
p01596_B,01596,B,can you always tell whether a stranger is your friend
p01597_B,01597,B,what what do you mean
p01598_B,01598,B,they have not gone in the direction of mau i hope on a night like this the people become most fanatical
p01599_B,01599,B,excellent news
p01600_B,01600,B,certainly not it returns to my dispensary at once now do you want me to treat your stings or do you prefer an english doctor there is one at asirgarh asirgarh is forty miles away and the ringnod dam broken now you see how you are placed i think i had better see mr fielding about you this is really great nonsense your present behaviour
p01601_B,01601,B,state doctor ridden over to enquire very little english
p01602_B,01602,B,but there s no rajah nothing
p01603_B,01603,B,i d rather not go nearer they have such strange customs and might hurt you
p01604_B,01604,B,like what
p01605_B,01605,B,aha you know my name i see yes i am aziz no of course your great friend miss quested did me no harm at the marabar
p01606_B,01606,B,what the devil have my hands to do with you this is a most strange remark i am a qualified doctor who will not hurt you
p01607_B,01607,B,come here please allow me to look
p01608_B,01608,B,i have brought you some salve but how to put it on in your present nervous state becomes a problem
p01609_B,01609,B,i can t tell you what that is i m sure his highness is dead i think we should go back at once shall we go back now
p01610_B,01610,B,did your mother speak to you about me

p01637_B,01637,B,dove dove buoni uomini
p01638_B,01638,B,what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised i don t think we ought to blame him very much it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesn t admire me or any of that nonsense one straw freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself he has improved he doesn t always look as if he s going to burst into tears he is a clerk in the general manager s office at one of the big railways not a porter and runs down to his father for week ends papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired there now for the garden suppose we don t talk about this silly italian business any more we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting

p01652_B,01652,B,i want something more definite will you speak to him it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word
p01653_B,01653,B,no i haven t let me see a sovereign s worth of silver no i haven t told cecil or any one i promised you i shouldn t here is your money all shillings except two half crowns would you count it you can settle your debt nicely now

p01666_B,01666,B,it is indeed
p01667_B,01667,B,oh bother the credit and who s been right or wrong we ve both made a muddle of it george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isn t he i want to know you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome can t you speak again to him now
p01668_B,01668,B,i want so to see the arno the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno the signora had no business to do it at all oh it is a shame
p01669_B,01669,B,cecil said one day and i thought it so profound that there are two kinds of cads the conscious and the subconscious
p01670_B,01670,B,not so that one could recognize it yes
p01671_B,01671,B,so one would have thought but things are so difficult i sometimes think
p01672_B,01672,B,no line he talked about italy like any other person it is really all right what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly i do wish i could make you see it my way he really won t be any nuisance charlotte
p01673_B,01673,B,how you do do everything
p01674_B,01674,B,i can t find them now and i don t want to either
p01675_B,01675,B,oh oh why it s mr beebe oh how perfectly lovely oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are oh
p01676_B,01676,B,he is really i think he was taken by surprise just as i was before but this time i m not to blame i want you to believe that i simply slipped into those violets no i want to be really truthful i am a little to blame i had silly thoughts the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book
p01677_B,01677,B,what train
p01678_B,01678,B,no to laugh at it
p01679_B,01679,B,i should have
p01680_B,01680,B,how angry he is with his father about the rooms it is all he can do to keep polite
p01681_B,01681,B,why did you tell her though this is a most serious thing cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again behind cecil s back ugh is it possible that men are such brutes behind cecil s back as we were walking up the garden what is to be done now can you tell me
p01682_B,01682,B,mother wouldn t mind i m sure
p01683_B,01683,B,mr beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature of course i was holding back on my cousin s account about old mr emerson i hardly know no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same time beautiful
p01684_B,01684,B,thank you charlotte
p01685_B,01685,B,well you know what i mean and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man
p01686_B,01686,B,i don t care if he does i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it
p01687_B,01687,B,i m sure she will and so will freddy
p01688_B,01688,B,and a cockney besides it might be london charlotte don t you feel too that we might be in london i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside i suppose it is one s being so tired
p01689_B,01689,B,you see we don t like to take
p01690_B,01690,B,i hadn t time to think you came
p01691_B,01691,B,no no you must have it

p01699_B,01699,B,yes but they pay extra for wine
p01700_B,01700,B,we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren t careful how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil
p01701_B,01701,B,well he amuses me either i m mad or else he is and i m inclined to think it s the latter one more fuss through with you charlotte many thanks i think though that this is the last my admirer will hardly trouble me again
p01702_B,01702,B,no church for me thank you
p01703_B,01703,B,certainly not there would be no difficulty whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over i have been frightened of him but now i am not one little bit

p01710_B,01710,B,i know i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable however what s done s done you have put me in a most awkward position how am i to get out of it he must that man must have such a setting down that he won t forget and who s to give it him i can t tell mother now owing to you nor cecil charlotte owing to you i am caught up every way i think i shall go mad i have no one to help me that s why i ve sent for you what s wanted is a man with a whip yes but it s no good agreeing what s to be done we women go maundering on what does a girl do when she comes across a cad
p01711_B,01711,B,charlotte here s an idea what if we popped off to rome to morrow straight to the vyses hotel for i do know what i want i m sick of florence no you said you d go to the ends of the earth do do
p01712_B,01712,B,signora bertolini would be upset
p01713_B,01713,B,but charlotte you know what happened then i want to be truthful it is so hard to be absolutely truthful
p01714_B,01714,B,about that dreadful afternoon in february
p01715_B,01715,B,she will make us pay for a whole week s pension
p01716_B,01716,B,let s leave it all till mother comes back

p01722_B,01722,B,i have been a failure failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster
p01723_B,01723,B,how do you do mr beebe i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peter s that very cold easter
p01724_B,01724,B,yes but won t you tell me now what you would have done
p01725_B,01725,B,i did just happen when i had tea with her at rome in the course of conversation
p01726_B,01726,B,my good lucia i am all at sea i know nothing about it whatever
p01727_B,01727,B,we must face that
p01728_B,01728,B,no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts please please i know i am a sad spoil sport but it would make me wretched i should practically be robbing the one who lost
p01729_B,01729,B,i trust not one would always pray against that
p01730_B,01730,B,how are you going to stop him talking about it
p01731_B,01731,B,but you tell her everything
p01732_B,01732,B,the train to rome
p01733_B,01733,B,far worse mr eager does not like eleanor she knows it herself the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him where things might lead to whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr eager or mr eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogether which they could scarcely do but in any case we must be prepared it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind a one horse carriage would do for us yet how difficult it is
p01734_B,01734,B,and then
p01735_B,01735,B,funny girl how you do remind me of your mother i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe
p01736_B,01736,B,and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence
p01737_B,01737,B,i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times
p01738_B,01738,B,i always said he was a cad dear give me credit for that at all events from the very first moment when he said his father was having a bath
p01739_B,01739,B,willingly would i move heaven and earth
p01740_B,01740,B,do not cry dearest take your time
p01741_B,01741,B,we must think of every possibility
p01742_B,01742,B,never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p01743_B,01743,B,poor lucy i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go
p01744_B,01744,B,i die for it
p01745_B,01745,B,what do you think about it
p01746_B,01746,B,at eight
p01747_B,01747,B,oh lucy i shall never forgive myself never to my dying day fancy if your prospects
p01748_B,01748,B,oh not that way back we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria
p01749_B,01749,B,it is my fault it is a disaster she will never forgive me and rightly for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish
p01750_B,01750,B,very well dear you know best perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young ladies are certainly different
p01751_B,01751,B,once a cad always a cad
p01752_B,01752,B,any nook does for me but it does seem hard that you shouldn t have a view
p01753_B,01753,B,dear one moment we may not have this chance for a chat again have you seen the young one yet
p01754_B,01754,B,then never never never more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine
p01755_B,01755,B,what does it mean
p01756_B,01756,B,our performer has changed her mind
p01757_B,01757,B,lucy dear
p01758_B,01758,B,mr eager will be offended it is your party
p01759_B,01759,B,lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner
p01760_B,01760,B,for instance the driver i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth
p01761_B,01761,B,how dreadful how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source
p01762_B,01762,B,very well dear how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too look lucia oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party i feared you would repent you of your choice
p01763_B,01763,B,i will never forgive eleanor she has betrayed my confidence
p01764_B,01764,B,if that is so dear if the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish
p01765_B,01765,B,no dear i want to explain why it is that i have taken the largest room naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this
p01766_B,01766,B,and the news
p01767_B,01767,B,undoubtedly he was
p01768_B,01768,B,lucy do you mind doing it
p01769_B,01769,B,beautiful are not beauty and delicacy the same
p01770_B,01770,B,this meat has surely been used for soup
p01771_B,01771,B,miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living
p01772_B,01772,B,come away from the window dear you will be seen from the road oh for a real man we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless there is mr eager but you do not trust him oh for your brother he is young but i know that his sister s insult would rouse in him a very lion thank god chivalry is not yet dead there are still left some men who can reverence woman it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try
p01773_B,01773,B,i insist on it your mother would never forgive me lucy
p01774_B,01774,B,when he insulted you how would you have replied
p01775_B,01775,B,naturally dear it is my affair
p01776_B,01776,B,to contradict it
p01777_B,01777,B,my dear girl no mr george emerson
p01778_B,01778,B,nothing dearest he knows nothing but he knows everything dearest had we better shall i it is dreadful to be entangled with low class people he saw it all
p01779_B,01779,B,in a book
p01780_B,01780,B,i dare not break your confidence there is something sacred in it unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her
p01781_B,01781,B,oh dear lucy i do hope florence isn t boring you speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow
p01782_B,01782,B,how do you propose to silence him
p01783_B,01783,B,but we fear him for you dear you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can be how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened
p01784_B,01784,B,when i was here for your sake if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her
p01785_B,01785,B,my dear lucia
p01786_B,01786,B,you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too i know well how much i vex you at every turn
p01787_B,01787,B,or perhaps old mr emerson knows in fact he is certain to know
p01788_B,01788,B,it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle
p01789_B,01789,B,well it isn t everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it oh one oughtn t to laugh really it might have been very serious but you were so sensible and brave so unlike the girls of my day
p01790_B,01790,B,what would have happened if i hadn t arrived
p01791_B,01791,B,you must have it
p01792_B,01792,B,what line is he taking up
p01793_B,01793,B,i wish one word with you in the drawing room mr emerson please good night mr emerson
p01794_B,01794,B,ah but yes i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped i might have known it would not do you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you i am too uninteresting and old fashioned only fit to pack and unpack your things
p01795_B,01795,B,once a cad always a cad that is my poor opinion
p01796_B,01796,B,i too intend to judge him charitably but unfortunately i have met the type before they seldom keep their exploits to themselves
p01797_B,01797,B,oh you droll person pray what would become of your drive in the hills
p01798_B,01798,B,i expect she will however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel isn t afternoon tea given there for nothing
p01799_B,01799,B,don t be troubled dearest wait till you are calmer we will talk it over before bed time in my room
p01800_B,01800,B,oh lucy dearest girl she hasn t put that in her book

p01807_B,01807,B,go mr eager don t ask our driver our driver is no help go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented

p01809_B,01809,B,so you ought a baby is worth a dozen saints and my baby s worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell in hell he s unhappy
p01810_B,01810,B,i suppose that mr vyse is going with you i hope it isn t because george spoke that you are both going
p01811_B,01811,B,why will he look at that fresco i saw nothing in it
p01812_B,01812,B,so george says he says that the miss alans must go to the wall yet it does seem so unkind
p01813_B,01813,B,i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he can t he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you i am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened
p01814_B,01814,B,the old trouble things won t fit
p01815_B,01815,B,but you are and there s a look of george about you and what were you saying about going abroad greece greece but you were to be married this year i thought

p01819_B,01819,B,baedeker i m glad it s that you minded it s worth minding the loss of a baedeker that s worth minding
p01820_B,01820,B,how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive what more is one to give him and think how he has been brought up free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy what are we to do with him he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaves like that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone eh what did you say now don t be stupid over this i don t require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible you might help me he has known so few women and you have the time you stop here several weeks i suppose but let yourself go you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night let yourself go pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself it will be good for both of you i only know what it is that s wrong with him not why it is
p01821_B,01821,B,certainly you can we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen
p01822_B,01822,B,especially as he has gone under
p01823_B,01823,B,as his mother did
p01824_B,01824,B,you are leaving him you are leaving the man you love
p01825_B,01825,B,my dear i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see to take you to it will be a real pleasure
p01826_B,01826,B,but mr eager he came when i was out and acted according to his principles i don t blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it
p01827_B,01827,B,how good everyone is and look at mr beebe housing me came over this morning and heard i was going here i am so comfortable with a fire
p01828_B,01828,B,he was not baptized i did hold firm my boy shall go back to the earth untouched oh last sunday george last sunday no not ill just gone under he is never ill but he is his mother s son her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live it was always touch and go he will live but he will not think it worth while to live he will never think anything worth while you remember that church at florence after you left florence horrible then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better you saw him bathing
p01829_B,01829,B,i only was told that he loved you last sunday i never could judge behaviour i i suppose he has
p01830_B,01830,B,but you are you re shocked but i mean to shock you it s the only hope at times i can reach you no other way you must marry or your life will be wasted you have gone too far to retreat i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry i know that with george you will find them and that you love him then be his wife he is already part of you though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die it isn t possible to love and to part you will wish that it was you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body ah the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ah for a little directness to liberate the soul your soul dear lucy i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round but we have souls i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours i cannot bear it it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell what nonsense i have talked how abstract and remote and i have made you cry dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by love marry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made then lucy
p01831_B,01831,B,the things of the universe it is quite true they don t
p01832_B,01832,B,not abominably he only tried when he should not have tried you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love do not go out of george s life saying he is abominable
p01833_B,01833,B,why miss honeychurch why my dear i am worried about you it seems to me that you are in a muddle take an old man s word there s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful it is on my muddles that i look back with horror on the things that i might have avoided we can help one another but little i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren t do you remember before when you refused the room with the view those were muddles little but ominous and i am fearing that you are in one now don t trust me miss honeychurch though life is very glorious it is difficult wrote a friend of mine i think he puts it well man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along especially the function of love that s it that s what i mean you love george but you do you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it you won t marry the other man for his sake
p01834_B,01834,B,but why women like looking at a view men don t george persuade them
p01835_B,01835,B,that woman understands everything but what are you doing here are you doing the church are you through with the church
p01836_B,01836,B,then there came something about a novel i didn t follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old ah well one must have failures george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms he can t bear to be about here and i must be where he is
p01837_B,01837,B,all the way to greece to greece
p01838_B,01838,B,i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george no it was wrong of george to try we have pushed our beliefs too far i fancy that we deserve sorrow
p01839_B,01839,B,george and i both know this but why does it distress him we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness but why should this make us unhappy let us rather love one another and work and rejoice i don t believe in this world sorrow then make my boy think like us make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yes a transitory yes if you like but a yes
p01840_B,01840,B,when i wouldn t have george baptized and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round she thought it a judgement oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents oh horrible worst of all worse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again a judgement and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church is it possible miss honeychurch shall we slip back into the darkness for ever
p01841_B,01841,B,gone under naturally
p01842_B,01842,B,miss honeychurch you do sound tired
p01843_B,01843,B,why shouldn t you
p01844_B,01844,B,there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world
p01845_B,01845,B,it s so obvious they should have the rooms there s nothing else to say
p01846_B,01846,B,perhaps he is i don t remember
p01847_B,01847,B,he will not come back
p01848_B,01848,B,it happened like this if it happened at all i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here
p01849_B,01849,B,yes why shouldn t you come by yourself
p01850_B,01850,B,i i ll come up to tennis if i can manage it
p01851_B,01851,B,some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up it did happen like that if it happened at all
p01852_B,01852,B,if you ve no baedeker you d better join us
p01853_B,01853,B,eat your dinner dear eat your dinner dear this pension is a failure to morrow we will make a change
p01854_B,01854,B,poor young man
p01855_B,01855,B,oh lucia come back here oh what an awful man
p01856_B,01856,B,has italy filled you with the fever of travel perhaps george emerson is right he says that
p01857_B,01857,B,i wish we could unluckily i have letters if you do want to go out alone won t you be better on your feet
p01858_B,01858,B,i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets
p01859_B,01859,B,i suspected it was unscholarly it s so beautiful
p01860_B,01860,B,no one knows no one will ever know miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling
p01861_B,01861,B,of course
p01862_B,01862,B,i think he is nice and tiresome i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expect i may say i hope you will differ but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores when he first came here he not unnaturally put people s backs up he has no tact and no manners i don t mean by that that he has bad manners and he will not keep his opinions to himself we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it
p01863_B,01863,B,miss lavish has led your cousin astray she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe
p01864_B,01864,B,oh rubbish miss honeychurch
p01865_B,01865,B,i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast
p01866_B,01866,B,why not
p01867_B,01867,B,i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise
p01868_B,01868,B,i have had an absurd letter from miss alan that was really what brought me over i thought it might amuse you all
p01869_B,01869,B,she oughtn t really to go at all and she knows it i put it down to too much beethoven
p01870_B,01870,B,it will be a novel dealing with modern italy let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know
p01871_B,01871,B,i am very sorry for that
p01872_B,01872,B,i needn t say that it will go no further
p01873_B,01873,B,they do say so
p01874_B,01874,B,i am more grieved than i can possibly express it is lamentable lamentable incredible
p01875_B,01875,B,in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready
p01876_B,01876,B,did you tell mr emerson about greece
p01877_B,01877,B,next week i gather
p01878_B,01878,B,yes he is waking up
p01879_B,01879,B,would your mother spare you again so soon you have scarcely been home three months
p01880_B,01880,B,doesn t mrs honeychurch like music
p01881_B,01881,B,you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel
p01882_B,01882,B,no of course i ll see how are the miss alans
p01883_B,01883,B,no he didn t
p01884_B,01884,B,the emersons who were at florence do you mean no i don t suppose it will prove to be them it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyse s oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people the queerest people for our part we liked them didn t we
p01885_B,01885,B,i am afraid it has been a bothersome business
p01886_B,01886,B,but they really are coming now i wrote to miss teresa a few days ago she was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably they are coming i heard from them this morning
p01887_B,01887,B,quite right i move into the rectory at summer street next june i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood
p01888_B,01888,B,the two ladies at all events have made it up
p01889_B,01889,B,it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you i do sympathize and agree most profoundly i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece
p01890_B,01890,B,come along tea tea tea
p01891_B,01891,B,still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you
p01892_B,01892,B,if you ll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing
p01893_B,01893,B,no i didn t suppose you would care to much how delicate those sonatas are miss honeychurch
p01894_B,01894,B,don t you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans now miss honeychurch go back keep warm i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling
p01895_B,01895,B,it s a beautiful song and a wise one go on
p01896_B,01896,B,with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe i didn t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa
p01897_B,01897,B,i fear that i have been officious i must apologize for my interference
p01898_B,01898,B,whatever happened
p01899_B,01899,B,but i must go somewhere i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing i must and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring you all think much too highly of me i wish you weren t so kind
p01900_B,01900,B,miss lavish is so original is it true that miss lavish is writing a book
p01901_B,01901,B,very well thank you
p01902_B,01902,B,and freddy minds
p01903_B,01903,B,i i did
p01904_B,01904,B,how delightful going abroad when do they start
p01905_B,01905,B,i wish miss lavish would tell me herself we started such friends but i don t think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldn t help being a little annoyed with miss lavish
p01906_B,01906,B,she must spare me i simply must go away i have to don t you see that i have to go away i didn t realize at the time and of course i want to see constantinople so particularly
p01907_B,01907,B,oh he did
p01908_B,01908,B,i don t think i will thank you
p01909_B,01909,B,no not at all cecil was very kind indeed only i had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a little it was that he is so masterful i found that he wouldn t let me go my own way he would improve me in places where i can t be improved cecil won t let a woman decide for herself in fact he daren t what nonsense i do talk but that is the kind of thing
p01910_B,01910,B,poor charlotte will be sopped
p01911_B,01911,B,mother charlotte cecil freddy you
p01912_B,01912,B,she doesn t mind it but she doesn t like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it she thinks i can t make out once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any one s she has never got over it of course i didn t mean that i played well i only meant
p01913_B,01913,B,because i do hope he won t go gossiping oh do tell me more about the miss alans how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad
p01914_B,01914,B,oh delightful i wish they d take me
p01915_B,01915,B,he is not going i made a slip mr vyse does stop behind in england
p01916_B,01916,B,so i hoped other people would think but they don t seem to
p01917_B,01917,B,oh that s nothing i assure you cissie villa s nothing to me i would give anything to go with them
p01918_B,01918,B,mr beebe old mr emerson is he nice or not nice i do so want to know no but it is so difficult sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him miss alan what do you think is he nice
p01919_B,01919,B,so does mother mother minds dreadfully
p01920_B,01920,B,i think so i ll see
p01921_B,01921,B,oh how glad i am the name of our house is windy corner there is mother and me generally and my brother though it s not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean
p01922_B,01922,B,i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice
p01923_B,01923,B,oh not italy but constantinople i have always longed to go to constantinople constantinople is practically asia isn t it
p01924_B,01924,B,yes yes i knew you d understand yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down
p01925_B,01925,B,he seems in better spirits he laughs more
p01926_B,01926,B,did freddy say whether he was driving straight back
p01927_B,01927,B,boys are so odd
p01928_B,01928,B,what is it about
p01929_B,01929,B,mr beebe i have misled you i have misled myself
p01930_B,01930,B,it isn t very good i forget why harmony or something
p01931_B,01931,B,oh charlotte we must have the rooms now the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be
p01932_B,01932,B,one is very thankful that she has such a resource she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be i know all about it the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak
p01933_B,01933,B,quite so
p01934_B,01934,B,i hardly know george for he hasn t learnt to talk yet he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains of course he has all his father s mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist
p01935_B,01935,B,i am eating it thank you and enjoying it
p01936_B,01936,B,not at all i never suggested that
p01937_B,01937,B,of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind
p01938_B,01938,B,i wonder
p01939_B,01939,B,exactly have you heard from any bertolini people lately i believe you keep up with miss lavish it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one another s lives two three four six of us no eight i had forgotten the emersons have kept more or less in touch we must really give the signora a testimonial we shan t have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on the darkness last night was appalling i have been thinking miss bartlett and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion nothing about the past i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin s credit she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her but the future seriously what do you think of this greek plan i don t know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career it s all i can t explain it s wrong i can t see the point of it myself
p01940_B,01940,B,he is rather a peculiar man i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude he has the merit if it is one of saying exactly what he means he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite it is so difficult at least i find it difficult to understand people who speak the truth
p01941_B,01941,B,we are friendly as one is in pensions
p01942_B,01942,B,perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother or will she come with us
p01943_B,01943,B,let us keep to the future though i want your advice
p01944_B,01944,B,really now why
p01945_B,01945,B,you acted very naturally all the same i don t think much harm would have come of accepting
p01946_B,01946,B,i know but it seems so odd so unlike her so i was going to say selfish
p01947_B,01947,B,so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced perhaps she must have a change i have no sisters or and i don t understand these things but why need she go as far as greece
p01948_B,01948,B,no mr beebe you are wrong the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato
p01949_B,01949,B,how tired one gets oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here
p01950_B,01950,B,that lady looks so clever we are in luck
p01951_B,01951,B,eleanor be quiet hush they ll hear the emersons
p01952_B,01952,B,oh lucy you ought to be with mr eager i m sure
p01953_B,01953,B,oh you wicked woman i am sure you are thinking of the emersons
p01954_B,01954,B,we are most grateful to you the first evening means so much when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d heure do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner
p01955_B,01955,B,lucy without a moment s doubt lucy the ground will do for me really i have not had rheumatism for years if i do feel it coming on i shall stand imagine your mother s feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen here we are all settled delightfully even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown sit down dear you are too unselfish you don t assert yourself enough now don t be alarmed this isn t a cold it s the tiniest cough and i have had it three days it s nothing to do with sitting here at all
p01956_B,01956,B,she is my idea of a really clever woman that last remark struck me as so particularly true it should be a most pathetic novel
p01957_B,01957,B,what is the heroine s name
p01958_B,01958,B,but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness
p01959_B,01959,B,i know yet freddy ought not to have told even you one cannot be too careful
p01960_B,01960,B,she wanted to leave windy corner
p01961_B,01961,B,i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits
p01962_B,01962,B,my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally
p01963_B,01963,B,it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment
p01964_B,01964,B,then i will say no more i am as it were the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing his manner was somewhat unfortunate i hope i acted for the best
p01965_B,01965,B,it is natural surely after such painful scenes that she should desire a change
p01966_B,01966,B,very well i for one will help her to go to greece will you it is absolutely necessary i know i know she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes i trust that the servants know nothing afterwards but i may have said too much already only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone if you help we may succeed otherwise
p01967_B,01967,B,lucy can always play
p01968_B,01968,B,it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street it would be death to gossip about mr vyse s dismissal at the present moment
p01969_B,01969,B,oh you relieve me so you think i ought to have accepted their offer you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious
p01970_B,01970,B,no harm of course but we could not be under an obligation
p01971_B,01971,B,i think one might venture now no lucy do not stir i will superintend the move
p01972_B,01972,B,you may well ask that why greece what is it minnie dear jam why not tunbridge wells oh mr beebe i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning i cannot help her i will say no more perhaps i have already said too much i am not to talk i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused
p01973_B,01973,B,i do implore absolute secrecy a chance word to a chattering friend and
p01974_B,01974,B,am i to conclude that he is a socialist and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too
p01975_B,01975,B,there i cannot agree with you in it i spy lucy s salvation
p01976_B,01976,B,i think he was meaning to be kind
p01977_B,01977,B,yet our rooms smell we dread going to bed
p01978_B,01978,B,ah then you look into the court if only mr emerson was more tactful we were so sorry for you at dinner
p01979_B,01979,B,i did not miss lavish told me
p01980_B,01980,B,national gallery
p01981_B,01981,B,it is fate that i am here but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy
p01982_B,01982,B,my father is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out
p01983_B,01983,B,it is i have reflected it is fate everything is fate we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fate flung together drawn apart the twelve winds blow us we settle nothing
p01984_B,01984,B,is it a very nice smell
p01985_B,01985,B,very well indeed
p01986_B,01986,B,why she rents a field of us how funny
p01987_B,01987,B,we sat opposite them at dinner last night they have given us their rooms they were so very kind
p01988_B,01988,B,what would you ask us
p01989_B,01989,B,i m sorry if you could manage without it i think i would rather not
p01990_B,01990,B,no in the surrey hills about five miles from dorking looking over the weald
p01991_B,01991,B,indeed i m not we are radicals too out and out my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland

p02066_B,02066,B,silly boy he thinks he s being dignified he knew we should go off in the spring he has known it for six months that if mother wouldn t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement ridiculous boy
p02067_B,02067,B,mr emerson
p02068_B,02068,B,weren t you pleased no wonder the novel s bad i never liked miss lavish but i suppose one ought to read it as one s met her

p02075_B,02075,B,no don t be rude to him mr eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte how cruel she would be to a man like that
p02076_B,02076,B,oh good gracious me where where
p02077_B,02077,B,i have behaved ridiculously i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me
p02078_B,02078,B,but this room reminds me of charlotte how horrible to grow old in charlotte s way to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn t have heard your father was in the house for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense you couldn t have made me when i am very happy i remember on how little it all hangs if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever
p02079_B,02079,B,mr emerson
p02080_B,02080,B,it is impossible no it is just possible
p02081_B,02081,B,why you did

p02088_B,02088,B,san miniato i ll just finish your sock
p02089_B,02089,B,i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour
p02090_B,02090,B,well i owe you a thousand apologies
p02091_B,02091,B,and mr vyse does he not matter that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly a detail of no importance i suppose may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition
p02092_B,02092,B,go please i do not want to call in mr vyse
p02093_B,02093,B,what do you mean
p02094_B,02094,B,i hope we all try
p02095_B,02095,B,he will never forgive us i mean he will never be interested in us again i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner i wish he hadn t but if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run
p02096_B,02096,B,i don t i shall probably want to live
p02097_B,02097,B,i want to ask you something before we go in
p02098_B,02098,B,because they re all alike because all that matters in them is distance and air
p02099_B,02099,B,you don t mean you don t mean that you are going to marry that man
p02100_B,02100,B,the man is dead the man is probably dead sit down till you are rested and don t move till i come back
p02101_B,02101,B,what does he say
p02102_B,02102,B,now kiss me here then here lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows
p02103_B,02103,B,no you aren t you d go openly if you were
p02104_B,02104,B,things i didn t want
p02105_B,02105,B,then let us come home there s no point in our stopping
p02106_B,02106,B,because we think it improves our characters but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened
p02107_B,02107,B,what photographs
p02108_B,02108,B,no he isn t well
p02109_B,02109,B,it is our last chance i shall do all that i can you wouldn t stop us this second time if you understood i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand it is being young it is being certain that lucy cares for me really it is that love and youth matter intellectually
p02110_B,02110,B,i didn t know what to do with them they were covered with blood there i m glad i ve told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them they ve gone i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the sea i don t know i may just mean that they frightened me for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled it isn t exactly that a man has died it has happened and i mean to find out what it is
p02111_B,02111,B,of course i do i saw her the day i arrived at summer street it was she who told me that you lived here
p02112_B,02112,B,same stuff as parsons are made of
p02113_B,02113,B,do you mind being beaten
p02114_B,02114,B,is it this is this possible i ll put a marvel to you that your cousin has always hoped that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like this of course very far down that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped i can t explain her any other way can you look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable the sight of us haunted her or she couldn t have described us as she did to her friend there are details it burnt i read the book afterwards she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy we can never make friends with her or thank her but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad
p02115_B,02115,B,oh all right
p02116_B,02116,B,but she did know she did see my father surely he said so
p02117_B,02117,B,miss honeychurch you sit still you aren t fit to go home alone
p02118_B,02118,B,you and are you tired
p02119_B,02119,B,or did she mean it
p02120_B,02120,B,you fainted
p02121_B,02121,B,you didn t attend
p02122_B,02122,B,perhaps well i acted the truth the only thing i did do and you came back to me so possibly you know nonsense with that sock
p02123_B,02123,B,but i can t
p02124_B,02124,B,i m afraid i don t
p02125_B,02125,B,remember the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared observe how giotto in these frescoes now unhappily ruined by restoration is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels
p02126_B,02126,B,how are you now
p02127_B,02127,B,my mother i was meaning
p02128_B,02128,B,i nearly fainted myself
p02129_B,02129,B,you may well wish that
p02130_B,02130,B,i never notice much difference in views
p02131_B,02131,B,why shouldn t i be a baby
p02132_B,02132,B,look at the lights going over the bridge
p02133_B,02133,B,then i don t fetch your photographs
p02134_B,02134,B,you cannot live with vyse he s only for an acquaintance he is for society and cultivated talk he should know no one intimately least of all a woman have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired
p02135_B,02135,B,no but have you ever he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things books pictures but kill when they come to people that s why i ll speak out through all this muddle even now it s shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person i would never have let myself go but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour that is the man all over playing tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no cecil all over again he daren t let a woman decide he s the type who s kept europe back for a thousand years every moment of his life he s forming you telling you what s charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon therefore not because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control i m not ashamed i don t apologize but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly but therefore therefore i settled to fight him
p02136_B,02136,B,i never said i was
p02137_B,02137,B,i shall want to live i say
p02138_B,02138,B,your behaviour oh yes all right all right
p02139_B,02139,B,why shouldn t i laugh what s there to cry at kiss me here any letters
p02140_B,02140,B,yes i have i m the same kind of brute at bottom this desire to govern a woman it lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden but i do love you surely in a better way than he does
p02141_B,02141,B,none why
p02142_B,02142,B,in the nave
p02143_B,02143,B,my father saw her and i prefer his word he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett a few minutes before you came in she was turning to go as he woke up he didn t speak to her it s clear that she knew then why did she risk the meeting she knew he was there and yet she went to church
p02144_B,02144,B,you will never go up you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives
p02145_B,02145,B,but we have spoilt the pleasure of i don t know how many people they won t come back
p02146_B,02146,B,george don t go george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon
p02147_B,02147,B,no remember nothing of the sort built by faith indeed that simply means the workmen weren t paid properly and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them look at that fat man in blue he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon now did this happen or didn t it yes or no
p02148_B,02148,B,then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am it s that mr eager why did he go did we talk too loud how vexatious i shall go and say we are sorry hadn t i better then perhaps he will come back
p02149_B,02149,B,stop there s plenty of room for us all stop
p02150_B,02150,B,it is not victory it is defeat you have parted two people who were happy we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it we have no rights over his soul
p02151_B,02151,B,the point is we have warred with it look fifty miles of spring and we ve come up to admire them do you suppose there s any difference between spring in nature and spring in man but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both
p02152_B,02152,B,she will be delighted she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon
p02153_B,02153,B,cousin of one of my parishioners i do not consider her choice of a piece happy beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs
p02154_B,02154,B,my sermon why ever did she listen to it
p02155_B,02155,B,introduce me
p02156_B,02156,B,i quite agree with you miss alan the italians are a most unpleasant people they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves we are at their mercy they read our thoughts they foretell our desires from the cab driver down to to giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it yet in their heart of hearts they are how superficial they have no conception of the intellectual life how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day that belongs to lavish a good fellow lavish but i wish she d start a pipe
p02157_B,02157,B,oh mr beebe indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose she took to it practically in despair after her life s work was carried away in a landslip surely that makes it more excusable
p02158_B,02158,B,violets oh dear who told you about the violets how do things get round a pension is a bad place for gossips no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eager s lecture at santa croce oh poor miss honeychurch it really was too bad no i have quite changed i do not like the emersons they are not nice but aren t they always waylaying you to go out with them dear
p02159_B,02159,B,italians dear you know
p02160_B,02160,B,perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through
p02161_B,02161,B,what was that
p02162_B,02162,B,only once charlotte didn t like it and said something quite politely of course
p02163_B,02163,B,i think i shall go out i want to go round the town in the circular tram on the platform by the driver
p02164_B,02164,B,most right of her they don t understand our ways they must find their level too late to go out all the galleries are shut
p02165_B,02165,B,it was a novel and i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink she said but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour this novel is to be about modern italy the other was historical but that she could not start till she had an idea first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came here this must on no account get round and so cheerful through it all i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them all the same she is a little too i hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived i don t know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely
p02166_B,02166,B,then sit you down observe my foresight
p02167_B,02167,B,aha miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning but perhaps you would rather not
p02168_B,02168,B,i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people of course this is the barest outline there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist
p02169_B,02169,B,i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterday s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life
p02170_B,02170,B,ah not for me for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time
p02171_B,02171,B,for her also it must have been a terrible experience i trust that neither of you was at all that it was not in your immediate proximity
p02172_B,02172,B,ignore him
p02173_B,02173,B,he is not he made an advantageous marriage
p02174_B,02174,B,dead miss bartlett dead i wonder yes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me he was in my london parish long ago the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him let him beware that he does not get more than a snub
p02175_B,02175,B,i should be astonished if you knew all the boy an innocent child at the time i will exclude god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him
p02176_B,02176,B,so you were here alone miss honeychurch
p02177_B,02177,B,so i saw were you indeed andate via sono occupato i am about to venture a suggestion would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week a drive in the hills we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour s ramble on the hillside the view thence of florence is most beautiful far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures that man had a decided feeling for landscape decidedly but who looks at it to day ah the world is too much for us so we shall be a partie carree in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity andate via andate presto presto ah the town beautiful as it is it is the town this very square so i am told witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration portentous and humiliating
p02178_B,02178,B,generally one has only sympathy for their success the desire for education and for social advance in these things there is something not wholly vile there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence little as they would make of it
p02179_B,02179,B,to speak plainly it is i will say no more
p02180_B,02180,B,and how came we to have you here
p02181_B,02181,B,we were chatting to miss lavish
p02182_B,02182,B,humiliating indeed miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened she can hardly bear to speak of it
p02183_B,02183,B,willingly would i purchase
p02184_B,02184,B,perhaps it is something that we had better not hear
p02185_B,02185,B,how wonderfully people rise in these days
p02186_B,02186,B,do not blame her please mr eager the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned

p02196_B,02196,B,i m not defending them they re nothing to me
p02197_B,02197,B,you have said very little
p02198_B,02198,B,that must have saved you much you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter press this man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views this is too much
p02199_B,02199,B,oh i thought they had been libelling me to you but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them
p02200_B,02200,B,oh indeed are you indeed if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little handed about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl you know the american girl in punch who says and the father replies there s travelling for you ha ha ha
p02201_B,02201,B,and you and your friend
p02202_B,02202,B,it was my intention to say very little murder if you want to know that man murdered his wife
p02203_B,02203,B,even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking courage courage and faith
p02204_B,02204,B,i quite agree the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace
p02205_B,02205,B,it does indeed tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day
p02206_B,02206,B,surely no
p02207_B,02207,B,quite so now the english colony at florence miss honeychurch and it is of considerable size though of course not all equally a few are here for trade for example but the greater part are students lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left no you can only see it if you stand no do not stand you will fall she is very proud of that thick hedge inside perfect seclusion one might have gone back six hundred years some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not
p02208_B,02208,B,doubtless you know her monographs in the series of mediaeval byways he is working at gemistus pletho sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i think think i think how little they think what lies so near them
p02209_B,02209,B,we must not submit i knew he was trying it on he is treating us as if we were a party of cook s tourists
p02210_B,02210,B,va bene signore va bene va bene she is my sister
p02211_B,02211,B,most certainly i would let them be but i dare say i shall receive scant support i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life this is what i call an adventure
p02212_B,02212,B,most certainly i have do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature
p02213_B,02213,B,he was not driving us well he jolted us
p02214_B,02214,B,the lord knows possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet he wrote a line so i heard yesterday which runs like this don t go fighting against the spring
p02215_B,02215,B,that i deny it was as restful as sleeping aha he is jolting us now can you wonder he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified and if i were superstitious i d be frightened of the girl too it doesn t do to injure young people have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici
p02216_B,02216,B,typical behaviour in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down
p02217_B,02217,B,would render a correct meaning
p02218_B,02218,B,charlotte dear charlotte kiss me kiss me again only you can understand me you warned me to be careful and i i thought i was developing

p02221_B,02221,B,all the way he will be hours
p02222_B,02222,B,apparently i told him it was unwise
p02223_B,02223,B,courage miss honeychurch courage and faith if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me
p02224_B,02224,B,george ask your driver which way george went the boy may lose his way he may be killed
p02225_B,02225,B,yes go and bathe george why do you dawdle talking bring them back to tea bring back some milk cakes honey the change will do you good george has been working very hard at his office i can t believe he s well

p02230_B,02230,B,how do you do very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry marriage is a duty i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too he has been most kind he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude ah this wind you do well to bathe yours is a glorious country honeychurch
p02231_B,02231,B,i ll be down in a minute
p02232_B,02232,B,i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you
p02233_B,02233,B,now it is all dark now beauty and passion seem never to have existed i know but remember the mountains over florence and the view ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him am i justified yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth truth counts truth does count
p02234_B,02234,B,the garden of eden which you place in the past is really yet to come we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies in this not in other things we men are ahead we despise the body less than women do but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden
p02235_B,02235,B,how very odd of him

p02237_B,02237,B,i said i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth when it comes to the point he can t get on without me

p02248_B,02248,B,i trust they are the right sort of person all right lucy i see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother s a snob but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and it s affectation to pretend there isn t
p02249_B,02249,B,mr beebe i don t see how mr beebe comes in
p02250_B,02250,B,no i shall not keep quiet you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house
p02251_B,02251,B,oh cecil oh cecil do tell me

p02255_B,02255,B,for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then i think things are coming to a head
p02256_B,02256,B,i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more
p02257_B,02257,B,hush dear
p02258_B,02258,B,freddy you must come there they still are
p02259_B,02259,B,then the whole thing runs
p02260_B,02260,B,you never can dear but i can you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties will this do then i put in at the top i must write the letter out again i said that because i didn t want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maid s dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light she keeps that flat abominably
p02261_B,02261,B,you what do you mean
p02262_B,02262,B,i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlotte s how is she
p02263_B,02263,B,freddy i do call the way you talk unkind
p02264_B,02264,B,ridiculous child you think you re so holy and truthful but really it s only abominable conceit do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say i hope he boxed your ears how dare you say no
p02265_B,02265,B,i know dear she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return
p02266_B,02266,B,why so why shouldn t my permission be asked
p02267_B,02267,B,so am i
p02268_B,02268,B,nor me
p02269_B,02269,B,and me i ve swallowed one i ve swallowed a pollywog it wriggleth in my tummy i shall die emerson you beast you ve got on my bags
p02270_B,02270,B,i said to cecil
p02271_B,02271,B,so would i
p02272_B,02272,B,i answered no there fly into a stew i can t help it had to say it i had to say no he ought never to have asked me
p02273_B,02273,B,i don t know whether they re any emersons
p02274_B,02274,B,the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully not content with permission which i did give that is to say i said well not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasn t off my head with joy he practically put it like this wasn t it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her and he would have an answer he said it would strengthen his hand
p02275_B,02275,B,oh yes and you will be satisfied too for they re friends of cecil so you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety
p02276_B,02276,B,cross it out too
p02277_B,02277,B,yes mother you told me a jolly good letter
p02278_B,02278,B,i feel never mind
p02279_B,02279,B,oh don t go
p02280_B,02280,B,you know mr beebe s funny way when you never quite know what he means he said i was very cute i asked him what he meant he said i couldn t make him say any more but it set me thinking since cecil has come after lucy he hasn t been so pleasant at least i can t explain
p02281_B,02281,B,not a bit i only let out i didn t like him i don t hate him but i don t like him what i mind is that he ll tell lucy
p02282_B,02282,B,but look at lucy complaining of saturn and all the time s got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in that s right minnie go for her get her over the shins with the racquet get her over the shins
p02283_B,02283,B,the bother is this
p02284_B,02284,B,i liked him till just now i suppose it s having him spoiling lucy s first week at home and it s also something that mr beebe said not knowing
p02285_B,02285,B,look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellow s got to dry and if another fellow
p02286_B,02286,B,time they did
p02287_B,02287,B,it s his third go isn t it
p02288_B,02288,B,i don t see you ought to go peeping like that
p02289_B,02289,B,look out
p02290_B,02290,B,suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country
p02291_B,02291,B,he asked me for my permission also
p02292_B,02292,B,i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right
p02293_B,02293,B,i didn t mean to be unkind but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy i don t know how girls manage things but she can t have said properly before or she wouldn t have to say it again now over the whole thing i can t explain i do feel so uncomfortable
p02294_B,02294,B,oh do keep quiet mother i had to say no when i couldn t say yes i tried to laugh as if i didn t mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right but i feel my foot s in it oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work
p02295_B,02295,B,isn t mr eager a parson of the cultured type
p02296_B,02296,B,come this way immediately
p02297_B,02297,B,to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous
p02298_B,02298,B,i promessi sposi she has accepted me
p02299_B,02299,B,we were speaking of motives
p02300_B,02300,B,mrs honeychurch what if we two walk home and leave you
p02301_B,02301,B,i count myself a lucky person when i m in london i feel i could never live out of it when i m in the country i feel the same about the country after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best it s true that in nine cases out of ten they don t seem to notice anything the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town do you feel that mrs honeychurch
p02302_B,02302,B,no business of ours
p02303_B,02303,B,would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it and i d stop here and tell my mother
p02304_B,02304,B,i hope so
p02305_B,02305,B,a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless
p02306_B,02306,B,this way please mrs honeychurch this way
p02307_B,02307,B,i say lucy
p02308_B,02308,B,miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett

p02310_B,02310,B,oh poor mr beebe was that his waistcoat we left in the path cecil mr beebe s waistcoat
p02311_B,02311,B,i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond
p02312_B,02312,B,i am so glad welcome as one of the family this is indeed a joyous day i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy
p02313_B,02313,B,my dear cecil look here this is me that s windy corner the rest of the pattern is the other people motives are all very well but the fence comes here
p02314_B,02314,B,how well did you know them at the bertolini
p02315_B,02315,B,this isn t very kind of you two you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old
p02316_B,02316,B,steady on
p02317_B,02317,B,we go with lucy
p02318_B,02318,B,i didn t mean the egg was well boiled because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i don t care for eggs i only meant how jolly kind she seemed
p02319_B,02319,B,may me and lucy get down from our chairs we don t want no dessert
p02320_B,02320,B,yes you go with lucy
p02321_B,02321,B,i ve come for tea mr vyse do you suppose that i shall get it
p02322_B,02322,B,grazie tante
p02323_B,02323,B,i am glad that you approve i daren t face the healthy person for example freddy honeychurch
p02324_B,02324,B,i have no profession it is another example of my decadence my attitude quite an indefensible one is that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i don t care a straw about but somehow i ve not been able to begin
p02325_B,02325,B,i am sorry i have given you a shock i fear that lucy s choice does not meet with your approval
p02326_B,02326,B,i suppose anne never told them you were here in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet the faults of mary i forget the faults of mary but they are very grave shall we look in the garden
p02327_B,02327,B,in what way
p02328_B,02328,B,the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small the faults of freddy
p02329_B,02329,B,i should say so food is the thing one does get here don t sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it
p02330_B,02330,B,it has broken now
p02331_B,02331,B,i meant that she is going to marry me
p02332_B,02332,B,she has none
p02333_B,02333,B,and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes
p02334_B,02334,B,at present
p02335_B,02335,B,i m shockingly stupid over local affairs i can t even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those aren t the right names i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery it is very remiss of me italy and london are the only places where i don t feel to exist on sufferance
p02336_B,02336,B,news i don t understand you news
p02337_B,02337,B,admirable the sort who has made england what she is
p02338_B,02338,B,you are conscious of having said something indiscreet
p02339_B,02339,B,has he indeed
p02340_B,02340,B,but the string never broke
p02341_B,02341,B,you are very fortunate it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure
p02342_B,02342,B,well i must say i ve only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence since i came to summer street she has been away you saw her didn t you at rome and in the alps oh i forgot of course you knew her before no she wasn t wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be
p02343_B,02343,B,broken what do you mean
p02344_B,02344,B,ah he has too many no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable
p02345_B,02345,B,oh freddy s a good sort isn t he
p02346_B,02346,B,i know the faults of mary she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs
p02347_B,02347,B,i ve come for tea and for gossip isn t this news
p02348_B,02348,B,i am sorry i must apologize i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way mr vyse you ought to have stopped me
p02349_B,02349,B,no i have said nothing indiscreet i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step she has taken it she has learnt you will let me talk freely as i have begun freely she has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides she has learnt through you let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her
p02350_B,02350,B,i quite agree at present she has none
p02351_B,02351,B,i m not cynical i m only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle then we shall have her heroically good heroically bad too heroic perhaps to be good or bad
p02352_B,02352,B,let me see mr vyse i forget what is your profession
p02353_B,02353,B,i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack
p02354_B,02354,B,where are the others i insist on extracting tea before evening service
p02355_B,02355,B,not that but you ought to have stopped me i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes perhaps i oughtn t to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you
p02356_B,02356,B,i could as easily tell you what tune she ll play next there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string picture number two the string breaks
p02357_B,02357,B,unpardonable question to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church i ll set mrs honeychurch after you
p02358_B,02358,B,no i mightn t have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall
p02359_B,02359,B,come for a walk with me you have worried them as much as they can stand mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may

p02382_B,02382,B,it isn t fair cecil i blame you i blame you very much indeed you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense i consider it most disloyal of you
p02383_B,02383,B,a room
p02384_B,02384,B,yes with no view i fancy why not
p02385_B,02385,B,don t listen to him sir harry he s tiresome
p02386_B,02386,B,now a clergyman that i do hate a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr eager the english chaplain at florence he was truly insincere not merely the manner unfortunate he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things
p02387_B,02387,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean i have never felt anything of the sort you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person
p02388_B,02388,B,perhaps the road is more sensible as we re got up smart
p02389_B,02389,B,don t you like mr beebe
p02390_B,02390,B,it s impossible i don t want to make difficulties but it really isn t fair on the maids to fill up the house so
p02391_B,02391,B,one has to go through it i suppose they won t notice us so much next time
p02392_B,02392,B,cecil no it s not fair i ve probably met them before
p02393_B,02393,B,oh cecil whatever do you mean the sacred lake
p02394_B,02394,B,all that you say is quite true i wonder whether whether it matters so very much
p02395_B,02395,B,what cecil
p02396_B,02396,B,how tiresome couldn t you have escaped to tennis
p02397_B,02397,B,no more you have
p02398_B,02398,B,but cecil
p02399_B,02399,B,i can t remember why i suppose it comes out of some book it s only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and can t get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful then freddy used to bathe there he is very fond of it
p02400_B,02400,B,he isn t clever but really he is nice
p02401_B,02401,B,of course you may cecil you might before i can t run at you you know emerson was the name not harris
p02402_B,02402,B,oh cecil
p02403_B,02403,B,oh now and then
p02404_B,02404,B,there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife
p02405_B,02405,B,the old man s
p02406_B,02406,B,that old man i told you about the one mr eager was so unkind to
p02407_B,02407,B,do you know that you re right i do i must be a poetess after all when i think of you it s always as in a room how funny
p02408_B,02408,B,haven t i the wood then
p02409_B,02409,B,which way shall we go
p02410_B,02410,B,no you don t you don t know what the word means
p02411_B,02411,B,i have heard freddy has told us naughty cecil i suppose i must forgive you just think of all the trouble i took for nothing certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and i d rather have nice friends of yours but you oughtn t to tease one so
p02412_B,02412,B,yes i suppose we ought to be going
p02413_B,02413,B,i am so sorry that you were stranded
p02414_B,02414,B,i never said so i consider him far above the average i only denied
p02415_B,02415,B,yes they are i haven t met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood
p02416_B,02416,B,no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life in london he would keep his place he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and everyone even your mother is taken in
p02417_B,02417,B,hear hear
p02418_B,02418,B,sometimes they are forced on us though
p02419_B,02419,B,i can t help it it would be wrong not to loathe that man
p02420_B,02420,B,who found you out
p02421_B,02421,B,not that but the congratulations it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public property a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment all those old women smirking
p02422_B,02422,B,it matters supremely sir harry is the essence of that garden party oh goodness how cross i feel how i do hope he ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa some woman so really vulgar that he ll notice it gentlefolks ugh with his bald head and retreating chin but let s forget him
p02423_B,02423,B,i d rather that you connected me with the open air
p02424_B,02424,B,perhaps he had
p02425_B,02425,B,he is the clever sort like myself
p02426_B,02426,B,poor girl lucy
p02427_B,02427,B,what sort of things
p02428_B,02428,B,i don t know that you aren t i connect you with a view a certain type of view why shouldn t you connect me with a room
p02429_B,02429,B,i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well
p02430_B,02430,B,i don t play tennis at least not in public the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato
p02431_B,02431,B,in the umbrian room absolute strangers they were admiring luca signorelli of course quite stupidly however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little they had been to italy
p02432_B,02432,B,why do you call it that
p02433_B,02433,B,i had got an idea i dare say wrongly that you feel more at home with me in a room
p02434_B,02434,B,lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before
p02435_B,02435,B,e un diavolo incarnato you know the proverb well i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them
p02436_B,02436,B,hitherto never not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me
p02437_B,02437,B,so you do love me little thing
p02438_B,02438,B,what old man
p02439_B,02439,B,then i ask you may i now
p02440_B,02440,B,are there two ways
p02441_B,02441,B,is it typical of country society
p02442_B,02442,B,let us take mrs honeychurch s advice and hate clergymen no more what s this place
p02443_B,02443,B,i d rather go through the wood why is it lucy that you always say the road do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged
p02444_B,02444,B,friends of mine but lucy the whole joke is to come come here do you know where i met these desirable tenants in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week
p02445_B,02445,B,now some beethoven
p02446_B,02446,B,in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage the father to live there the son to run down for week ends i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they weren t actual blackguards it was great sport and wrote to him making out
p02447_B,02447,B,perfectly fair anything is fair that punishes a snob that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long you ll agree with me there ought to be intermarriage all sorts of things i believe in democracy
p02448_B,02448,B,and you
p02449_B,02449,B,a drawing room pray with no view
p02450_B,02450,B,yes or at the most in a garden or on a road never in the real country like this
p02451_B,02451,B,no you don t
p02452_B,02452,B,what name
p02453_B,02453,B,but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong an engagement horrid word in the first place is a private matter and should be treated as such
p02454_B,02454,B,cecil has told you to think so you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever no it is just the same thing everywhere
p02455_B,02455,B,not in that way at times i could wring her neck but not in that way no it is the same with cecil all over
p02456_B,02456,B,then if you re so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy
p02457_B,02457,B,but pick it up and don t stand idling there like a flamingo
p02458_B,02458,B,lucy you ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one s sentences did charlotte mention her boiler
p02459_B,02459,B,is it a thing or a person when freddy sings
p02460_B,02460,B,then depend upon it it is the boiler i know myself how water preys upon one s mind i would rather anything else even a misfortune with the meat
p02461_B,02461,B,oh rubbish if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better
p02462_B,02462,B,emerson freddy do you know what emersons they are
p02463_B,02463,B,oh i see dear poetry i tell you who has no as you call them and that s mr beebe
p02464_B,02464,B,i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man pray does that satisfy you
p02465_B,02465,B,perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether
p02466_B,02466,B,since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him whenever i speak he winces i see him lucy it is useless to contradict me no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember
p02467_B,02467,B,well i see the likeness the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters
p02468_B,02468,B,but why at all
p02469_B,02469,B,and you are right too greece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you
p02470_B,02470,B,minnie can sleep with you
p02471_B,02471,B,go and dress dear you ll be late
p02472_B,02472,B,oh that reminds me you never told me what charlotte said in her letter
p02473_B,02473,B,perhaps he s tired because otherwise because otherwise i cannot account for him
p02474_B,02474,B,come here old lady thank you for putting away my bonnet kiss me
p02475_B,02475,B,very well old lady stop the horse
p02476_B,02476,B,my goodness gracious me child you ll blow my head off whatever is there to shout over i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen
p02477_B,02477,B,didn t she say how she was how does she sound cheerful
p02478_B,02478,B,oh goodness how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett
p02479_B,02479,B,charlotte again my dear that s all her very words
p02480_B,02480,B,don t say and stop go
p02481_B,02481,B,plenty of society
p02482_B,02482,B,stop here s sir harry now we shall know sir harry pull those things down at once
p02483_B,02483,B,from your own account you told her as much
p02484_B,02484,B,then why didn t he leave the room why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone s pleasure
p02485_B,02485,B,very well take your independence and be gone rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear view and then share a flat with another girl
p02486_B,02486,B,nonsense it can
p02487_B,02487,B,there you go
p02488_B,02488,B,then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour
p02489_B,02489,B,surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour
p02490_B,02490,B,here s mr beebe
p02491_B,02491,B,i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic but i cannot see why you didn t tell your friends about cecil and be done with it there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant but why shouldn t it be everywhere in no time
p02492_B,02492,B,lucy i do call the way you talk unkind
p02493_B,02493,B,don t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings
p02494_B,02494,B,how s charlotte
p02495_B,02495,B,and mess with typewriters and latch keys and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police and call it a mission when no one wants you and call it duty when it means that you can t stand your own home and call it work when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them
p02496_B,02496,B,you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me i m so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work you ve got rid of cecil well and good and i m thankful he s gone though i did feel angry for the minute but why not announce it why this hushing up and tip toeing
p02497_B,02497,B,the truth is dear you don t like charlotte
p02498_B,02498,B,hush dear poor old man what was his name
p02499_B,02499,B,what rubbish and if you dislike charlotte so it s rather a pity you asked her to stop i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to
p02500_B,02500,B,thank you mother that doesn t matter a bit
p02501_B,02501,B,no i don t and no more does cecil she gets on our nerves you haven t seen her lately and don t realize how tiresome she can be though so good so please mother don t worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come
p02502_B,02502,B,she was a novelist
p02503_B,02503,B,yes i really can t stop i must dress too
p02504_B,02504,B,now mother i ve seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself
p02505_B,02505,B,i can t remember all charlotte s worries i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil
p02506_B,02506,B,i i see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtn t to but he does not mean to be uncivil he once explained it is the things that upset him he is easily upset by ugly things he is not uncivil to people
p02507_B,02507,B,half a minute would be nearer
p02508_B,02508,B,we weren t talking of real fences
p02509_B,02509,B,mother do come away oh for goodness sake do come
p02510_B,02510,B,cecil has a very high standard for people it s part of his ideals it is really that that makes him sometimes seem
p02511_B,02511,B,oh splendid oh thank you
p02512_B,02512,B,i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that
p02513_B,02513,B,by the by i never told you i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london
p02514_B,02514,B,i can t help it mother i don t like charlotte i admit it s horrid of me
p02515_B,02515,B,mr beebe knows my rude ways
p02516_B,02516,B,well if they are coming no minnie not saturn if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twenty ninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear one that doesn t count i told you not saturn
p02517_B,02517,B,i will bow i will not shake hands with him that will be just the proper thing
p02518_B,02518,B,i won t have her
p02519_B,02519,B,it s only for a few days
p02520_B,02520,B,oh yes i suppose so no not very cheerful i suppose
p02521_B,02521,B,hush mother people will hear you of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been you see i come into my money next year i ve seen the world so little i felt so out of things in italy i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london more not a cheap ticket like to day but to stop i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl
p02522_B,02522,B,we mustn t be unjust to people
p02523_B,02523,B,mother no it s impossible we can t have charlotte on the top of the other things we re squeezed to death as it is freddy s got a friend coming tuesday there s cecil and you ve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare it simply can t be done
p02524_B,02524,B,i beg your pardon
p02525_B,02525,B,no i don t think so mother cecil s all right
p02526_B,02526,B,her what
p02527_B,02527,B,my point is that you oughtn t to have asked charlotte to stop i wish you would keep to the point the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isn t raining oh for a little air
p02528_B,02528,B,emerson s a common enough name
p02529_B,02529,B,one thing and another among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if she d come up and see us and mercifully didn t
p02530_B,02530,B,perhaps i spoke hastily
p02531_B,02531,B,but has cecil
p02532_B,02532,B,all right mother
p02533_B,02533,B,i don t know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike
p02534_B,02534,B,you can t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do
p02535_B,02535,B,is that house to let again powell
p02536_B,02536,B,i tore the thing up
p02537_B,02537,B,because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england i shall tell them then it s much pleasanter how wet it is let s turn in here oh well let it be shop then let s go to mudie s i ll buy a guide book
p02538_B,02538,B,because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears i ve given up cecil may begin again
p02539_B,02539,B,let me just put your bonnet away may i
p02540_B,02540,B,well she would leave florence so stupidly she flurried
p02541_B,02541,B,it s only the library book that cecil s been reading
p02542_B,02542,B,oh very slightly i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did
p02543_B,02543,B,i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly
p02544_B,02544,B,all right
p02545_B,02545,B,oh dear what shall i do what shall i do
p02546_B,02546,B,no i hate seeings off
p02547_B,02547,B,oh i had no idea
p02548_B,02548,B,if minnie sleeps in the bath not otherwise
p02549_B,02549,B,it s only another muddle of freddy s freddy doesn t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead
p02550_B,02550,B,i want more independence
p02551_B,02551,B,mrs honeychurch i meant to i can t i really can t turn out miss flack
p02552_B,02552,B,but what can i do an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden
p02553_B,02553,B,i think i follow you but it is as you say a very sad thing
p02554_B,02554,B,my advice is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all i know the type preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy it s a sad thing but i d far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down
p02555_B,02555,B,am i not always right she ought to have gone before the contract was signed does she still live rent free as she did in her nephew s time
p02556_B,02556,B,turn her out
p02557_B,02557,B,you ought to find a tenant at once it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk
p02558_B,02558,B,hopeless vulgarian
p02559_B,02559,B,the rent is absurdly low and perhaps i am an easy landlord but it is such an awkward size it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves
p02560_B,02560,B,exactly that is exactly what i fear mr vyse it will attract the wrong type of people the train service has improved a fatal improvement to my mind and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles
p02561_B,02561,B,then may i write to my misses alan
p02562_B,02562,B,rather a strenuous clerk it would be sir harry i have an idea how would you like spinsters
p02563_B,02563,B,yes i met them abroad
p02564_B,02564,B,the misses alan aren t that
p02565_B,02565,B,my dear lucy it would be splendid do you know any such
p02566_B,02566,B,indeed you may here we are with the difficulty solved already how delightful it is extra facilities please tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees oh the agents the appalling people they have sent me one woman when i wrote a tactful letter you know asking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance as if one cares about that and several references i took up were most unsatisfactory people swindlers or not respectable and oh the deceit i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week the deceit of the most promising people my dear lucy the deceit
p02567_B,02567,B,it s i who am tiresome i oughtn t to come with my troubles to young people but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help
p02568_B,02568,B,exactly the miss alans

p02663_B,02663,B,looking at italian art there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it
p02664_B,02664,B,and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write we are all so glad that you have come
p02665_B,02665,B,that s the best conversational opening i ve ever heard but i m afraid it will only act between men can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do come and have a bathe and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal

p02710_B,02710,B,there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows choose a place where you won t do harm yes choose a place where you won t do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine

p02727_B,02727,B,no good but surely i have a right to hear a little more
p02728_B,02728,B,all modern books are bad every one writes for money in these days
p02729_B,02729,B,who may miss lavish be
p02730_B,02730,B,it is true i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother you are even greater than i thought i m not going to worry you you are far too good to me i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldn t marry me and so have given me a chance to improve i have never known you till this evening i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be but this evening you are a different person new thoughts even a new voice
p02731_B,02731,B,no i can t well never mind the tennis why couldn t you couldn t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong you talked of our wedding at lunch at least you let me talk
p02732_B,02732,B,you had that bad headache yesterday all right i see it s much more than headaches but give me a moment s time you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other part i find it difficult i am likely to say the wrong thing
p02733_B,02733,B,you don t love me evidently i dare say you are right not to but it would hurt a little less if i knew why
p02734_B,02734,B,chapter two find me chapter two if it isn t bothering you here hand me the book
p02735_B,02735,B,i never do play tennis i never could play i don t understand a word you say
p02736_B,02736,B,i mean that a new person seems speaking through you
p02737_B,02737,B,how are my proteges
p02738_B,02738,B,now play us the other garden the one in parsifal
p02739_B,02739,B,this isn t the passage i wanted there is another much funnier further on
p02740_B,02740,B,but i love you and i did think you loved me
p02741_B,02741,B,i cannot think you were right i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly it s all too horrible
p02742_B,02742,B,i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer
p02743_B,02743,B,it is a question between ideals yours and mine pure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new i must actually thank you for what you have done for showing me what i really am solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman will you shake hands
p02744_B,02744,B,joseph emery prank
p02745_B,02745,B,well you sound tired as if something has worried you
p02746_B,02746,B,i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead it is the first thing that i remember cecil do read the thing about the view
p02747_B,02747,B,good bye cecil
p02748_B,02748,B,how do you like this view of ours mr emerson
p02749_B,02749,B,oh yes you do think it it s your old idea the idea that has kept europe back i mean the idea that women are always thinking of men if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says it s disgusting brutal as if a girl can t break it off for the sake of freedom
p02750_B,02750,B,no read away i think nothing s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go
p02751_B,02751,B,all right cecil that will do don t apologize to me it was my mistake
p02752_B,02752,B,i haven t had a really good education for one thing my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should
p02753_B,02753,B,because you re the sort who can t know any one intimately i don t mean exactly that but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something it is that more or less when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now you re always protecting me i won t be protected i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right to shield me is an insult can t i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you a woman s place you despise my mother i know you do because she s conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodness conventional cecil you re that for you may understand beautiful things but you don t know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me i won t be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me that s why i break off my engagement you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people
p02754_B,02754,B,i am very sorry about it i have carefully thought things over we are too different i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl
p02755_B,02755,B,anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife
p02756_B,02756,B,what s the good of a scene
p02757_B,02757,B,oh cecil
p02758_B,02758,B,oh a dreadful person mr emerson you remember miss lavish
p02759_B,02759,B,what do you mean by a new voice
p02760_B,02760,B,you can play well enough to make up a four i thought it abominably selfish of you
p02761_B,02761,B,what if i do it doesn t prevent me from realizing the truth i can t marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day
p02762_B,02762,B,i did not i thought i did at first i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too
p02763_B,02763,B,it isn t worth reading it s too silly to read i never saw such rubbish it oughtn t to be allowed to be printed
p02764_B,02764,B,there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to you when you wouldn t play tennis with freddy
p02765_B,02765,B,if you think i am in love with someone else you are very much mistaken
p02766_B,02766,B,proteges you shall see for yourself how your proteges are george emerson is coming up this afternoon he is a most interesting man to talk to only don t
p02767_B,02767,B,what fun cecil read away come mr emerson sit down after all your energy
p02768_B,02768,B,true on the whole
p02769_B,02769,B,should we go in to tea
p02770_B,02770,B,don t open the window and you d better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside i really think we had better go to bed if you don t mind i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking
p02771_B,02771,B,i knew you wouldn t understand i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations of course it isn t the tennis that was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wife for instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband i don t think so you don t like freddy nor my mother there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it until well until all things came to a point they have to day i see clearly i must speak that s all
p02772_B,02772,B,mr emerson have you any brothers or sisters
p02773_B,02773,B,of course i will good night cecil good bye that s all right i m sorry about it thank you very much for your gentleness

p02775_B,02775,B,tired that is exactly like you you always think women don t mean what they say
p02776_B,02776,B,not for me thank you i will not spoil the set
p02777_B,02777,B,my dear freddy i am no athlete as you well remarked this very morning i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you
p02778_B,02778,B,i have
p02779_B,02779,B,i m so glad you only talked about books cecil s hard hit lucy won t marry him if you d gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down
p02780_B,02780,B,oh come along cecil i m bad floyd s rotten and so i dare say s emerson
p02781_B,02781,B,there s an absurd account of a view in this book also that men fall into two classes those who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms
p02782_B,02782,B,then certainly i won t play

p02789_B,02789,B,he told us another day that views are really crowds crowds of trees and houses and hills and are bound to resemble each other like human crowds and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason for a crowd is more than the people who make it up something gets added to it no one knows how just as something has got added to those hills

p02810_B,02810,B,but it will all come right in the end he has to build us both up from the beginning again i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women he has for the second time quite altered why will men have theories about women i haven t any about men i wish too that mr beebe
p02811_B,02811,B,scusi tanto signora buona sera e grazie
p02812_B,02812,B,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them
p02813_B,02813,B,i think probably it must but slowly
p02814_B,02814,B,oh shame what a shocking speech
p02815_B,02815,B,can he spare you margaret important i should like you to have some companion to take walks with do try miss conder
p02816_B,02816,B,i remember something of the sort now
p02817_B,02817,B,in that case it is far too sudden
p02818_B,02818,B,not at all dear i wish you would let me help you in more important things
p02819_B,02819,B,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to
p02820_B,02820,B,oh margaret most dangerous
p02821_B,02821,B,on the contrary
p02822_B,02822,B,no margaret most rude
p02823_B,02823,B,but she is not really interesting if only you had helen
p02824_B,02824,B,dear margaret do come into the library and shut the door your good maids are dusting the banisters
p02825_B,02825,B,staring most rudely
p02826_B,02826,B,of course i regard you schlegels as english english to the backbone and that reminds me helen s letter
p02827_B,02827,B,but margaret dear i mean we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts it is too sudden surely
p02828_B,02828,B,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather
p02829_B,02829,B,it s as well to be prepared
p02830_B,02830,B,not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once
p02831_B,02831,B,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p02832_B,02832,B,but this is something quite new
p02833_B,02833,B,so uncivilised
p02834_B,02834,B,helen was looking up at the wilcoxes flat
p02835_B,02835,B,i knew it and there s mr wilcox
p02836_B,02836,B,then in that case
p02837_B,02837,B,how very rude
p02838_B,02838,B,no but he has to do his chinese some real companion is what you need really helen is odd
p02839_B,02839,B,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret
p02840_B,02840,B,and helen must be careful too
p02841_B,02841,B,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down
p02842_B,02842,B,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do
p02843_B,02843,B,only with helen
p02844_B,02844,B,i beg your pardon i interrupted you what was it you were saying about reality
p02845_B,02845,B,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me
p02846_B,02846,B,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p02847_B,02847,B,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be
p02848_B,02848,B,do tell me this at all events are you for the rich or for the poor
p02849_B,02849,B,so am i and so i am afraid are most of my acquaintances at swanage but i am surprised that you agree with us
p02850_B,02850,B,then in that case my dear why go down i consider you odd girls and very wonderful girls and in many ways far older than your years but you won t be offended frankly i feel you are not up to this business it requires an older person dear i have nothing to call me back to swanage i am all at your disposal let me go down to this house whose name i forget instead of you
p02851_B,02851,B,i call that rather cynical
p02852_B,02852,B,that s more like socialism
p02853_B,02853,B,but you will be careful won t you
p02854_B,02854,B,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p02855_B,02855,B,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow
p02856_B,02856,B,whom is margaret talking to would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in
p02857_B,02857,B,for riches
p02858_B,02858,B,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh
p02859_B,02859,B,but imagine the evenings turn the electric light on here or there and it s almost the same room one evening they may forget to draw their blinds down and you ll see them and the next you yours and they ll see you impossible to sit out on the balconies impossible to water the plants or even speak imagine going out of the front door and they come out opposite at the same moment and yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary and you d rather risk it
p02860_B,02860,B,but margaret dear
p02861_B,02861,B,how very odd of helen mr wilcox
p02862_B,02862,B,i have been for a little walk with miss conder
p02863_B,02863,B,why shouldn t she
p02864_B,02864,B,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none
p02865_B,02865,B,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p02866_B,02866,B,do you agree do you think music is so different from pictures
p02867_B,02867,B,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say
p02868_B,02868,B,i wonder or was it sensible
p02869_B,02869,B,can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different
p02870_B,02870,B,there s nothing rash to do
p02871_B,02871,B,who knows aunt juley who knows
p02872_B,02872,B,oh yes aunt juley i am thinking all right about helen s letter i know i must go down and see her i am thinking about her all right i am meaning to go down
p02873_B,02873,B,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk
p02874_B,02874,B,i had worked round to myself as usual
p02875_B,02875,B,i hate plans i hate lines of action helen isn t a baby
p02876_B,02876,B,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off
p02877_B,02877,B,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin
p02878_B,02878,B,too difficult ask me another am i for poverty or for riches for riches hurrah for riches
p02879_B,02879,B,who knows
p02880_B,02880,B,i gathered nothing
p02881_B,02881,B,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money
p02882_B,02882,B,well would you be very kind would you come round with me to the registry office there s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no
p02883_B,02883,B,it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans
p02884_B,02884,B,not want but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles s
p02885_B,02885,B,oh i used an affected word i only meant would you please talk the thing over only with helen
p02886_B,02886,B,no it s as well not to be prepared
p02887_B,02887,B,i have tibby aunt juley
p02888_B,02888,B,in that case i can make no plans don t you see
p02889_B,02889,B,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us i didn t tell you at the time it might have made you angry and you had enough to worry you but i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them she didn t answer it
p02890_B,02890,B,helen is odd very
p02891_B,02891,B,the train crossed by a bridge of boats and at first sight it looked quite fine but oh in five minutes we had seen the whole thing the cathedral had been ruined absolutely ruined by restoration not an inch left of the original structure we wasted a whole day and came across the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens they too poor things had been taken in they were actually stopping at speyer and they rather liked helen s insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg as a matter of fact they did come on next day we all took some drives together they knew us well enough to ask helen to come and see them at least i was asked too but tibby s illness prevented me so last monday she went alone that s all you know as much as i do now it s a young man out of the unknown she was to have come back saturday but put off till monday perhaps on account of i don t know
p02892_B,02892,B,oh certainly fiendishly careful
p02893_B,02893,B,helen won t be able to stop aunt juley she has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you she must go back to germany as soon as you are well
p02894_B,02894,B,exactly germans are too thorough
p02895_B,02895,B,oh yes
p02896_B,02896,B,yes dear
p02897_B,02897,B,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong
p02898_B,02898,B,no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us she has not the least balance
p02899_B,02899,B,mr wilcox possibly
p02900_B,02900,B,thank you so much aunt juley while i have talked theories you have done the flowers
p02901_B,02901,B,helen you must tell me whether this thing worries you
p02902_B,02902,B,aunt juley i must must go to howards end myself you don t exactly understand though i can never thank you properly for offering
p02903_B,02903,B,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them
p02904_B,02904,B,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality
p02905_B,02905,B,in either case one can class it as reassuring
p02906_B,02906,B,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p02907_B,02907,B,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p02908_B,02908,B,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus
p02909_B,02909,B,yes for riches money for ever
p02910_B,02910,B,what is it
p02911_B,02911,B,i hope to risk things all my life
p02912_B,02912,B,i ll go for her other letters no i won t i ll finish my breakfast in fact i haven t them we met the wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from heidelberg to speyer helen and i had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at speyer the archbishop of speyer was one of the seven electors you know speyer maintz and koln those three sees once commanded the rhine valley and got it the name of priest street
p02913_B,02913,B,i m afraid so
p02914_B,02914,B,mr wilcox she s wanting howards end
p02915_B,02915,B,excuse me asking but are you the younger mr wilcox or the elder
p02916_B,02916,B,he has to make his way out in nigeria he couldn t think of marrying for years and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate and is in other ways why hasn t he told us of course he s ashamed he knows he s been a fool and so he has a downright fool whereas miss schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news
p02917_B,02917,B,but excuse me one moment i can t think what they re doing with that parcel hi hi you there are you going to keep me waiting all day parcel for wilcox howards end just look sharp this station s abominably organised if i had my way the whole lot of em should get the sack may i help you in
p02918_B,02918,B,the mater will be very glad to see you
p02919_B,02919,B,and do you object to going through the village it is rather a longer spin but i have one or two commissions
p02920_B,02920,B,all i know is she s spread the thing and he hasn t and my father s away and i
p02921_B,02921,B,i wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads
p02922_B,02922,B,i said nothing of the sort i beg your pardon i did not my name is charles do you mean to tell me that paul do you mean to tell me that paul and your niece
p02923_B,02923,B,i beg you will do no such thing i take you up this moment to the house let me tell you the thing s impossible and must be stopped
p02924_B,02924,B,i m sorry to be so dense but i still haven t quite understood
p02925_B,02925,B,paul paul paul is there any truth in this
p02926_B,02926,B,in front or behind which do you prefer it may be windy in front
p02927_B,02927,B,no i came over with my father he has gone on north in your train you ll see miss schlegel at lunch you re coming up to lunch i hope
p02928_B,02928,B,scarcely as i am already engaged to another lady oh good god don t tell me it s some silliness of paul s
p02929_B,02929,B,what way
p02930_B,02930,B,could you possibly lower your voice the shopman will overhear i warn you paul hasn t a penny it s useless
p02931_B,02931,B,what news
p02932_B,02932,B,i think i catch your meaning what an extraordinary mistake
p02933_B,02933,B,the younger can i do anything for you
p02934_B,02934,B,oh rather miss schlegel is stopping with us did you want to see her
p02935_B,02935,B,i beg your pardon i didn t catch
p02936_B,02936,B,the idiot the idiot the little fool
p02937_B,02937,B,i m not
p02938_B,02938,B,very good of you to say so i was just tooling my father over to catch the down train
p02939_B,02939,B,might i finish my sentence please
p02940_B,02940,B,not at all if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office this way
p02941_B,02941,B,miss schlegel and myself
p02942_B,02942,B,this is very good of you very good indeed it is just what i should have wished
p02943_B,02943,B,i quite agree sir the thing is impossible and i will come up and stop it my niece is a very exceptional person and i am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her considering she has only known your brother since wednesday and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel
p02944_B,02944,B,no need to warn us mr wilcox i assure you the warning is all the other way my niece has been very foolish and i shall give her a good scolding and take her back to london with me
p02945_B,02945,B,yes they care for one another very much indeed i dare say they will tell you about it by and by we heard this morning
p02946_B,02946,B,then you didn t the least
p02947_B,02947,B,i should love going through the village naturally i am very anxious to talk things over with you you can well imagine that the news was a great shock to us
p02948_B,02948,B,not at all mr wilcox
p02949_B,02949,B,margaret could not come herself on account of poor tibby so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk
p02950_B,02950,B,in front if i may then we can talk
p02951_B,02951,B,i should like to come up
p02952_B,02952,B,and all that i know is
p02953_B,02953,B,helen mr wilcox my niece and you
p02954_B,02954,B,but you are paul
p02955_B,02955,B,mr wilcox margaret has told me everything everything i have seen helen s letter
p02956_B,02956,B,that you and she
p02957_B,02957,B,if that is your attitude mr wilcox i prefer to walk
p02958_B,02958,B,oh well really are you i
p02959_B,02959,B,that is very kind
p02960_B,02960,B,about helen helen of course helen is a very exceptional person i am sure you will let me say this feeling towards her as you do indeed all the schlegels are exceptional i come in no spirit of interference but it was a great shock
p02961_B,02961,B,then why did you say so at the station
p02962_B,02962,B,you see we heard from helen this morning
p02963_B,02963,B,if i were a man mr wilcox for that last remark i d box your ears you re not fit to clean my niece s boots to sit in the same room with her and you dare you actually dare i decline to argue with such a person
p02964_B,02964,B,my niece is not with you by any chance
p02965_B,02965,B,i trust there has been no misunderstanding her letter certainly read that way
p02966_B,02966,B,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p02967_B,02967,B,oh my darling helen
p02968_B,02968,B,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p02969_B,02969,B,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p02970_B,02970,B,oh dearest margaret i do hope she won t be overtired
p02971_B,02971,B,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p02972_B,02972,B,now look frau liesecke at my niece s train you see it is coming towards us coming coming and when it gets to corfe it will actually go through the downs on which we are standing so that if we walk over as i suggested and look down on swanage we shall see it coming on the other side shall we

p02997_B,02997,B,don t begin how on earthing she kept repeating not uncivilly but with extreme gloom in vain i asked her what she did know some knew what others knew and others didn t and then others again had better be careful oh dear she was incompetent she had a face like a silkworm and the dining room reeks of orris root we chatted pleasantly a little about husbands and i wondered where hers was too and advised her to go to the police she thanked me we agreed that mr lanoline s a notty notty man and hasn t no business to go on the lardy da but i think she suspected me up to the last bags i writing to aunt juley about this now meg remember bags i
p02998_B,02998,B,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini

p03000_B,03000,B,i suppose not but one loses faith in everything after this
p03001_B,03001,B,perhaps the wilcoxes are beginning the siege
p03002_B,03002,B,oh yes the nice people who gave aunt juley a new hearth rug he seems interesting in some ways very and one wishes one could help him he is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much he likes books and what one may roughly call adventure and if he had a chance but he is so poor he lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes one is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink well he got mixed up in our debate he wasn t the subject of it but it seemed to bear on his point suppose a millionaire died and desired to leave money to help such a man how should he be helped should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct which was margaret s plan most of them thought this would pauperise him should he and those like him be given free libraries i said no he doesn t want more books to read but to read books rightly my suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday but then there is his wife and they said she would have to go too nothing seemed quite right now what do you think imagine that you were a millionaire and wanted to help the poor what would you do
p03003_B,03003,B,oh meg dear why do we talk at all tell me how is it that all the books are down here
p03004_B,03004,B,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle

p03020_B,03020,B,what do you mean
p03021_B,03021,B,now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter will you be as careful as all that

p03026_B,03026,B,no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad
p03027_B,03027,B,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p03028_B,03028,B,it s not a thing like that
p03029_B,03029,B,but oh meg what a theory
p03030_B,03030,B,you would not but i am serious in asking you
p03031_B,03031,B,all right

p03039_B,03039,B,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p03040_B,03040,B,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p03041_B,03041,B,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul
p03042_B,03042,B,i offered bracknell and he was rejected so was tibby cheer up tibby it s no one we know i said oh and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier
p03043_B,03043,B,all right auntie tibby
p03044_B,03044,B,then let us
p03045_B,03045,B,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p03046_B,03046,B,you mean to keep proportion and that s heroic it s greek and i don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you go on and fight with him and help him don t ask me for help or even for sympathy henceforward i m going my own way i mean to be thorough because thoroughness is easy i mean to dislike your husband and to tell him so i mean to make no concessions to tibby if tibby wants to live with me he must lump me i mean to love you more than ever yes i do you and i have built up something real because it is purely spiritual there s no veil of mystery over us unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body the popular view is as usual exactly the wrong one our bothers are over tangible things money husbands house hunting but heaven will work of itself
p03047_B,03047,B,because i probably agree with you
p03048_B,03048,B,but your marriage has been happy meg
p03049_B,03049,B,ducie street is his house this is ours our furniture our sort of people coming to the door do let us camp out just one night and tom shall feed us on eggs and milk why not it s a moon
p03050_B,03050,B,what a time they all are what can they be doing inside i wish henry was out to enjoy this this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house it s very hard
p03051_B,03051,B,come again
p03052_B,03052,B,i remember paul at breakfast i shall never forget him he had nothing to fall back upon i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever
p03053_B,03053,B,i said my good mrs lanoline we have some grave misunderstanding here beautiful as i am my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty and never never has mr lanoline rested his eyes on mine
p03054_B,03054,B,i can t pretend very long sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case unless you will come with me
p03055_B,03055,B,you feel as i do
p03056_B,03056,B,what i say i was as it were orating my speech annie opens the door like a fool and shows a female straight in on me with my mouth open then we began very civilly no how unjust one is she said whom not what she got it perfectly so i said and she said and there we were
p03057_B,03057,B,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do cheers children it s mrs lanoline
p03058_B,03058,B,it was over at once
p03059_B,03059,B,you wouldn t have she s an italian by birth at least she makes her living by journalism i met her originally on garda monica is much the best person to see me through
p03060_B,03060,B,then did the card see the wife
p03061_B,03061,B,the carpet s a mistake i know that we had it in london but this floor ought to be bare it is far too beautiful
p03062_B,03062,B,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p03063_B,03063,B,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p03064_B,03064,B,it is always meg
p03065_B,03065,B,no just a little longer it is so beautiful tell me oh yes did you say money is the warp of the world
p03066_B,03066,B,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that
p03067_B,03067,B,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p03068_B,03068,B,not a thing only an ending
p03069_B,03069,B,no we have no real ties
p03070_B,03070,B,all right i ll sit down if you ll sit down
p03071_B,03071,B,yes he s gone some time
p03072_B,03072,B,oh meg you are a person think of the racket and torture this time last year but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried what a change and all through you
p03073_B,03073,B,heaven help us if we do
p03074_B,03074,B,i hope charles took the hint
p03075_B,03075,B,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p03076_B,03076,B,yes yes but what has leonard got out of life
p03077_B,03077,B,ah that greengage tree why do i connect it with dumb bells and there come the chickens the grass wants cutting i love yellow hammers
p03078_B,03078,B,he is fond of baby that s why he does it they re going to be lifelong friends
p03079_B,03079,B,no i don t like the drawing room so much the beam has been match boarded it would have been so beautiful otherwise
p03080_B,03080,B,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion i don t like those men they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow good it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr brits of today are in pain
p03081_B,03081,B,taken a what oh what s that do come in how do you do
p03082_B,03082,B,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes
p03083_B,03083,B,i require no suggestions i shall not alter anything in my plans but it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you it will be something to look back on oh meg lovey do let s
p03084_B,03084,B,i suppose you are letting it though
p03085_B,03085,B,yes i am annoyed my wishes should have been respected i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary planning my life as i now have to do
p03086_B,03086,B,yes i might have but decided to wait
p03087_B,03087,B,yes but who settled us down you you did it all sweetest though you re too stupid to see living here was your plan i wanted you he wanted you and everyone said it was impossible but you knew just think of our lives without you meg i and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie but you picked up the pieces and made us a home can t it strike you even for a moment that your life has been heroic can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest when you began to act and did all
p03088_B,03088,B,over here meg put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn ye es the window s too high
p03089_B,03089,B,because i m an old maid i can t think why i go on like this myself
p03090_B,03090,B,if what
p03091_B,03091,B,whatever have i done
p03092_B,03092,B,it will be as easy as eating
p03093_B,03093,B,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew
p03094_B,03094,B,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p03095_B,03095,B,yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you
p03096_B,03096,B,they re starving i found them starving
p03097_B,03097,B,remember i who remember everything but it looks to be ours now
p03098_B,03098,B,for you
p03099_B,03099,B,oh we don t want leave charles may say no
p03100_B,03100,B,but i am interested you talk as if i had lost all my interest in life i am still helen i hope now this hasn t the feel of a dead house the hall seems more alive even than in the old days when it held the wilcoxes own things
p03101_B,03101,B,i should like to know how he got hold of your card
p03102_B,03102,B,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p03103_B,03103,B,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times
p03104_B,03104,B,but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger
p03105_B,03105,B,fastened at the bosom with a cairngorm pin
p03106_B,03106,B,oh do stop
p03107_B,03107,B,but affectionate tourists
p03108_B,03108,B,and mine
p03109_B,03109,B,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts
p03110_B,03110,B,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p03111_B,03111,B,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p03112_B,03112,B,i brought them i did it all

p03114_B,03114,B,oh what a place for mother s chiffonier
p03115_B,03115,B,it s his duty to
p03116_B,03116,B,so do i tibby only cares for cultured females singing brahms
p03117_B,03117,B,and never will
p03118_B,03118,B,and a great deal of furniture has been unpacked
p03119_B,03119,B,the conclave s breaking at last i ll go
p03120_B,03120,B,don t don t don t meg don t don t don t do such a thing i tell you not to don t i know don t
p03121_B,03121,B,here s the house a regular hen coop
p03122_B,03122,B,no of course not
p03123_B,03123,B,tibby is moderately a dear now
p03124_B,03124,B,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p03125_B,03125,B,i do mean what i said don t it wouldn t do
p03126_B,03126,B,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p03127_B,03127,B,but you ve never conceivably you ve never
p03128_B,03128,B,is that enough
p03129_B,03129,B,anyhow it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun feel their dear little backs are quite warm
p03130_B,03130,B,tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime
p03131_B,03131,B,her figure may have been good once
p03132_B,03132,B,perhaps yes if you like i m mad but i ve brought them i ll stand injustice no longer i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves
p03133_B,03133,B,i don t hate him now i have stopped being a schoolgirl and meg once again i m not being unkind but as for fitting in with your english life no put it out of your head at once imagine a visit from me at ducie street it s unthinkable tell me about yourself
p03134_B,03134,B,it s our last chance of seeing mr wilcox he s going to scotland i know he is i insist on seeing him
p03135_B,03135,B,no indirectly via mr wilcox
p03136_B,03136,B,the basts
p03137_B,03137,B,this is mr wilcox s house
p03138_B,03138,B,there is mrs bast too
p03139_B,03139,B,convenient you did not tell me that the books were unpacked i have found nearly everything that i want
p03140_B,03140,B,coffee it was coffee surely impossible tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time
p03141_B,03141,B,why does he want them meg may i tell you something i like henry
p03142_B,03142,B,because in death i agree
p03143_B,03143,B,i hope it will be permanent
p03144_B,03144,B,though we have walked too
p03145_B,03145,B,it makes no difference thinking things out they come to the same
p03146_B,03146,B,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness
p03147_B,03147,B,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p03148_B,03148,B,why meg they re so much nicer generally i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it
p03149_B,03149,B,of course she s right
p03150_B,03150,B,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree
p03151_B,03151,B,this is not quite our house yet when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists
p03152_B,03152,B,but loved him
p03153_B,03153,B,no only withered
p03154_B,03154,B,then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home
p03155_B,03155,B,oh yes i should we have taken a flat in munich by we i mean myself and monica but for her i am and have been and always wish to be alone
p03156_B,03156,B,i don t think so she doesn t really mind the admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy
p03157_B,03157,B,but it s stupid
p03158_B,03158,B,walking at night
p03159_B,03159,B,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past
p03160_B,03160,B,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me you must not think that we shall never meet i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better but you haven t understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you this is a shock to you it isn t to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps such as this i cannot live in england
p03161_B,03161,B,kindly take back that word hangers on
p03162_B,03162,B,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p03163_B,03163,B,for that is all we can do i am glad to have seen you and the things
p03164_B,03164,B,it has been a great surprise certainly has aunt juley been ill
p03165_B,03165,B,and to me and to all women so one kissed paul
p03166_B,03166,B,if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go even at queen victoria s dinner party if something had been just a little different perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin
p03167_B,03167,B,i knew it was our last chance
p03168_B,03168,B,meg if you start in your honest english vein i shall throw the treacle at you
p03169_B,03169,B,not all the books she hasn t unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense and we never used to have the sword here
p03170_B,03170,B,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard one can t go through a great deal of without planning one s actions in advance i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me i will go through them if necessary but only then in the second place i have no right to trouble people i cannot fit in with england as i know it i have done something that the english never pardon it would not be right for them to pardon it so i must live where i am not known
p03171_B,03171,B,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing
p03172_B,03172,B,but why didn t you tell me dearest
p03173_B,03173,B,just so and possibly worse than dull
p03174_B,03174,B,oh she must have overheard you
p03175_B,03175,B,i do not agree i do not
p03176_B,03176,B,helen you ve not forgiven me for my treachery you couldn t talk like this to me if you had
p03177_B,03177,B,that s brutal mine is an absolutely different case i ve thought things out
p03178_B,03178,B,i m not grave
p03179_B,03179,B,yes to morrow
p03180_B,03180,B,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p03181_B,03181,B,yes you must do
p03182_B,03182,B,what was that
p03183_B,03183,B,have you actually brought two starving people from london to shropshire helen
p03184_B,03184,B,but he said something about a concert and an umbrella
p03185_B,03185,B,i told you nothing that was true
p03186_B,03186,B,north west
p03187_B,03187,B,oh helen stop saying don t it s ignorant it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime don t is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr bast well
p03188_B,03188,B,that s better well where shall i begin when i arrived at waterloo no i ll go back before that because i m anxious you should know everything from the first the first was about ten days ago it was the day mr bast came to tea and lost his temper i was defending him and mr wilcox became jealous about me however slightly i thought it was the involuntary thing which men can t help any more than we can you know at least i know in my own case when a man has said to me so and so s a pretty girl i am seized with a momentary sourness against so and so and long to tweak her ear it s a tiresome feeling but not an important one and one easily manages it but it wasn t only this in mr wilcox s case i gather now
p03189_B,03189,B,yes that is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette don t you think that is extraordinarily generous it has made me like him very much he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future i like mr wilcox he is taking up his work rubber it is a big business i gather he is launching out rather charles is in it too charles is married a pretty little creature but she doesn t seem wise they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own
p03190_B,03190,B,do you oh very well but we ve nothing to put it in and he wants the can
p03191_B,03191,B,we shall be that everywhere and for ever
p03192_B,03192,B,was father alive
p03193_B,03193,B,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before
p03194_B,03194,B,helen what a memory you have for some things you re perfectly right it s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women men don t know what we want
p03195_B,03195,B,certainly dearest
p03196_B,03196,B,how do you like your work
p03197_B,03197,B,was she pretty
p03198_B,03198,B,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p03199_B,03199,B,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p03200_B,03200,B,we shan t consult him
p03201_B,03201,B,but helen my pet we can t without getting henry s leave of course he would give it but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at ducie street now and this is equally intimate
p03202_B,03202,B,bag it by all means i m not sure that this is so funny helen it means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere doesn t it
p03203_B,03203,B,oh i m getting an old maid i suppose i thought i minded nothing but really i i should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and you did go red you know when aunt juley attacked you this morning i shouldn t have referred to it otherwise
p03204_B,03204,B,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago
p03205_B,03205,B,it may be a greater thing for baby
p03206_B,03206,B,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p03207_B,03207,B,this is awfully kind of you but i m afraid it s not going to do the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family
p03208_B,03208,B,i know but the house isn t supposed to be slept in and henry s suggestion was
p03209_B,03209,B,not quite i feel that you and i and henry are only fragments of that woman s mind she knows everything she is everything she is the house and the tree that leans over it people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness i cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine she knew about realities she knew when people were in love though she was not in the room i don t doubt that she knew when henry deceived her
p03210_B,03210,B,no one
p03211_B,03211,B,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p03212_B,03212,B,not exactly
p03213_B,03213,B,why should you put things so bitterly dearie
p03214_B,03214,B,meaning that i was dead i felt it
p03215_B,03215,B,i needn t say how much it would mean to me
p03216_B,03216,B,i haven t the least notion
p03217_B,03217,B,it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand
p03218_B,03218,B,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p03219_B,03219,B,try a drawing room chair
p03220_B,03220,B,i don t know
p03221_B,03221,B,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements
p03222_B,03222,B,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you
p03223_B,03223,B,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while
p03224_B,03224,B,interested are you very well i must tell you i suppose my husband lent it on condition we but by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of look here i can t go on like this i warn you i won t helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry
p03225_B,03225,B,i must show you a picture upstairs
p03226_B,03226,B,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p03227_B,03227,B,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live
p03228_B,03228,B,now helen what did really happen
p03229_B,03229,B,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p03230_B,03230,B,which you change in a moment
p03231_B,03231,B,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p03232_B,03232,B,oh helen whatever have you done now
p03233_B,03233,B,what is it
p03234_B,03234,B,i have got it that every morning for three weeks no wonder tibby was wild
p03235_B,03235,B,yes but i don t feel inclined to talk
p03236_B,03236,B,i warehoused that in london why
p03237_B,03237,B,it s a better vein than the cosmopolitan now children which is it to be you know the ducie street house shall i say yes or shall i say no tibby love which i m specially anxious to pin you both it depends on nothing of the sort say yes i think that our race is degenerating we cannot settle even this little thing what will it be like when we have to settle a big one
p03238_B,03238,B,you ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella
p03239_B,03239,B,but how on earth
p03240_B,03240,B,still no more plans now and no more reminiscences sleep now
p03241_B,03241,B,you mean that you want to go away from me
p03242_B,03242,B,but what an extraordinary
p03243_B,03243,B,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p03244_B,03244,B,how helen
p03245_B,03245,B,there i knew you d say that in the end of course he s a dear listen what s that
p03246_B,03246,B,it seems so
p03247_B,03247,B,it is no good hesitating shall i drive down to hilton now and get leave
p03248_B,03248,B,it s no good i think unless you really mean to know people the discussion brought that home to me we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse we mustn t play at friendship no it s no good
p03249_B,03249,B,interesting people don t get one houses
p03250_B,03250,B,starting at the ages of six and one
p03251_B,03251,B,now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it s that for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people
p03252_B,03252,B,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end
p03253_B,03253,B,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p03254_B,03254,B,looking back that was wrong of me
p03255_B,03255,B,oh really
p03256_B,03256,B,yes of that i m pretty sure indeed i began the moment he spoke to me
p03257_B,03257,B,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p03258_B,03258,B,it will sweeten to morrow
p03259_B,03259,B,i say helen
p03260_B,03260,B,not anything to do with bracknell
p03261_B,03261,B,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured
p03262_B,03262,B,surely you remember howards end
p03263_B,03263,B,what nonsense listen
p03264_B,03264,B,that child is a wonderful nursemaid
p03265_B,03265,B,i don t think we could well do that
p03266_B,03266,B,who why have you come
p03267_B,03267,B,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p03268_B,03268,B,don t you feel it now
p03269_B,03269,B,i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles
p03270_B,03270,B,you d be odd if you didn t
p03271_B,03271,B,usen t
p03272_B,03272,B,you are very fond of her then
p03273_B,03273,B,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter
p03274_B,03274,B,helen are you mad
p03275_B,03275,B,the ws coming
p03276_B,03276,B,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p03277_B,03277,B,helen is a little selfish i have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying
p03278_B,03278,B,knew what
p03279_B,03279,B,oh helen am i will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that
p03280_B,03280,B,miss avery was extraordinary she loved mrs wilcox and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty in consequence here are all the library books
p03281_B,03281,B,don t be absurd they aren t starving and you know it now begin from the beginning i won t have such theatrical nonsense how dare you yes how dare you bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way my goodness but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy look servants people out of the windows they think it s some vulgar scandal and i must explain oh no it s only my sister screaming and only two hangers on of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason
p03282_B,03282,B,the sword looks well though
p03283_B,03283,B,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p03284_B,03284,B,expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing
p03285_B,03285,B,very much what one chooses it s something that isn t money one can t say more
p03286_B,03286,B,do yes that s worth doing let us
p03287_B,03287,B,was paul there
p03288_B,03288,B,henry she has had such a nice letter from the queer cross boy do you remember him he had a sad moustache but the back of his head was young
p03289_B,03289,B,how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art
p03290_B,03290,B,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p03291_B,03291,B,are you serious in asking me helen should i get on with your monica
p03292_B,03292,B,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later mr w much concerned and slightly titillated
p03293_B,03293,B,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge
p03294_B,03294,B,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either
p03295_B,03295,B,helen i told you about poor mrs wilcox that sad business
p03296_B,03296,B,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home
p03297_B,03297,B,helen you wouldn t think i d invent that
p03298_B,03298,B,undoubtedly he is probably the son of madge and madge is dreadful but this place has wonderful powers
p03299_B,03299,B,helen come to bed
p03300_B,03300,B,i don t agree in two thousand years they ll know look where tibby spilt the soup
p03301_B,03301,B,come away from those books helen do talk to me
p03302_B,03302,B,a touch of the w s perhaps
p03303_B,03303,B,not that but i can t
p03304_B,03304,B,oh take care
p03305_B,03305,B,there now whatever whatever is the matter
p03306_B,03306,B,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p03307_B,03307,B,if even that worries you we could arrange something there s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease thanks to our money we might even go away for a little
p03308_B,03308,B,shan t i go up to town to day take the house if it s the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow and start enjoying myself i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind
p03309_B,03309,B,i had but am wanting a long talk about it now what is it against him helen you must try and say
p03310_B,03310,B,wait one minute
p03311_B,03311,B,i don t know what s happened to either of us we must both have gone mad look here sit down
p03312_B,03312,B,perhaps an adventure
p03313_B,03313,B,but the rhyme was simply awful no decent person could put up with it
p03314_B,03314,B,but what has mr wilcox to do with paul
p03315_B,03315,B,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september
p03316_B,03316,B,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p03317_B,03317,B,the car has gone and here s your cab
p03318_B,03318,B,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i ll do nothing no doubt you re right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry only i won t have it so choose if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them in my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice i have no use for justice if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves but he wants work and that we can t give him but possibly henry can
p03319_B,03319,B,we thought it was illness but even then i haven t behaved worthily i ought not to have consulted any one what would our father have thought of me
p03320_B,03320,B,very well i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you ve brought them here or why you re here yourself
p03321_B,03321,B,look at the chairs though
p03322_B,03322,B,take them off to the george then and i ll try poor creatures but they look tired i haven t nearly done with you though helen you have been most self indulgent i can t get over it you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older think it over and alter yourself or we shan t have happy lives
p03323_B,03323,B,i believe you would never have told me
p03324_B,03324,B,little boy what do you want
p03325_B,03325,B,dreadfully that is why i wish dolly had not come too to day still he wanted them all to come it has to be
p03326_B,03326,B,why indeed
p03327_B,03327,B,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me
p03328_B,03328,B,i think we won t
p03329_B,03329,B,he is such a man in theory but oh helen in theory
p03330_B,03330,B,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife
p03331_B,03331,B,why you re all alone
p03332_B,03332,B,porphyrion fire insurance company
p03333_B,03333,B,what s happened to you
p03334_B,03334,B,and he likes you because you don t
p03335_B,03335,B,i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me
p03336_B,03336,B,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet
p03337_B,03337,B,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others
p03338_B,03338,B,the house is dead why worry on about it
p03339_B,03339,B,her husband may be though
p03340_B,03340,B,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years
p03341_B,03341,B,i believe we shall come to care about people less and less helen the more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them it s one of the curses of london i quite expect to end my life caring most for a place
p03342_B,03342,B,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own
p03343_B,03343,B,there s nothing to tell
p03344_B,03344,B,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p03345_B,03345,B,well done but come into the drawing room now and don t talk about him to the wilcoxes make light of the whole thing
p03346_B,03346,B,you still have a mania for under furnishing would you care to come into the dining room before you start there s no carpet there
p03347_B,03347,B,i have not heard of monica
p03348_B,03348,B,he only says reduced
p03349_B,03349,B,with an india shawl over her shoulders
p03350_B,03350,B,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better
p03351_B,03351,B,what do you know
p03352_B,03352,B,but why has miss avery made them set to partners i shall just
p03353_B,03353,B,series of mistakes
p03354_B,03354,B,to my mind you use the intellect but you no longer care about it that i call stupidity you only care about the things that you can use and therefore arrange them in the following order money supremely useful intellect rather useful imagination of no use at all no your pan germanism is no more imaginative than is our imperialism over here it is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven that is not imagination no it kills it when their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once and naturally your poets too are dying your philosophers your musicians to whom europe has listened for two hundred years gone gone with the little courts that nurtured them gone with esterhazy and weimar what what s that your universities oh yes you have learned men who collect more facts than do the learned men of england they collect facts and facts and empires of facts but which of them will rekindle the light within
p03355_B,03355,B,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p03356_B,03356,B,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p03357_B,03357,B,so do i oh so do i
p03358_B,03358,B,of course i don t mind it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there s nothing to be grave about at all
p03359_B,03359,B,i expect so
p03360_B,03360,B,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p03361_B,03361,B,oh i do wonder i do wonder whether she s taken the house
p03362_B,03362,B,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train
p03363_B,03363,B,meg and i haven t got such tender hearts if there s a chance of a cheap house we go for it
p03364_B,03364,B,better that he had
p03365_B,03365,B,how awful to marry a man like those cupids
p03366_B,03366,B,i knew it i told you so it is the little things one bungles at the big real ones are nothing when they come
p03367_B,03367,B,you see the wilcoxes collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles they have one ducie street two howards end where my great rumpus was three a country seat in shropshire four charles has a house in hilton and five another near epsom and six evie will have a house when she marries and probably a pied a terre in the country which makes seven oh yes and paul a hut in africa makes eight i wish we could get howards end that was something like a dear little house didn t you think so aunt juley
p03368_B,03368,B,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p03369_B,03369,B,yes so do i but oh dear dear how dreadful it all seems and in the autumn there began that anti pauline movement you and frieda and meg and mrs wilcox all obsessed with the idea that i might yet marry paul
p03370_B,03370,B,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p03371_B,03371,B,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p03372_B,03372,B,on the drum aunt juley
p03373_B,03373,B,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you
p03374_B,03374,B,i was afraid that i saw it out of proportion but you are right outside it and you must know in a day or two or perhaps a week take whatever steps you think fit i leave it in your hands the facts as they touch meg are all before you
p03375_B,03375,B,five thousand
p03376_B,03376,B,could i bathe my eyes tibby now for the explanation why didn t i begin with it i have found out something about mr wilcox he has behaved very wrongly indeed and ruined two people s lives it all came on me very suddenly last night i am very much upset and i do not know what to do mrs bast
p03377_B,03377,B,sunrise or something when i could get away
p03378_B,03378,B,as regards wickham place and my share of the furniture you and she are to do exactly as you like my own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold what does one want with dusty economic books which have made the world no better or with mother s hideous chiffoniers i have also another commission for you i want you to deliver a letter i haven t written it yet why shouldn t i post it though my head is rather wretched i hope that none of your friends are likely to come in not there
p03379_B,03379,B,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p03380_B,03380,B,now what is the good of driblets to go through life having done one thing to have raised one person from the abyss not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets making the grey more grey no doubt people will think me extraordinary
p03381_B,03381,B,but you ll do it
p03382_B,03382,B,no thanks tibbikins you re being very good to me i want to tell you the story before i go abroad you must do exactly what you like treat it as part of the furniture meg cannot have heard it yet i think but i cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself i don t even know whether she ought to be told knowing as she does that i dislike him she will suspect me and think that i want to ruin her match i simply don t know what to make of such a thing i trust your judgment what would you do
p03383_B,03383,B,and ruined two people s lives and goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing and there always will be rich and poor he met her when he was trying to get rich out in cyprus i don t wish to make him worse than he is and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him but there it is they met he goes his way and she goes hers what do you suppose is the end of such women they end in two ways either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them and cause mr wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late she i can t blame her but this isn t all i come now to the business that took us to oniton we went all three acting on mr wilcox s advice the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one from which he is dismissed there are certain excuses but in the main mr wilcox is to blame as meg herself admitted it is only common justice that he should employ the man himself but he meets the woman and like the cur that he is he refuses and tries to get rid of them he makes meg write two notes came from her late that evening one for me one for leonard dismissing him with barely a reason i couldn t understand then it comes out that mrs bast had spoken to mr wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms and was still speaking about him when leonard came back to her this leonard knew all along he thought it natural he should be ruined twice natural could you have contained yourself
p03384_B,03384,B,of course a perfectly delightful experience oh mrs lanoline s a dear she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella she mislaid him saturday afternoon and for a long time suffered no inconvenience but all night and all this morning her apprehensions grew breakfast didn t seem the same no no more did lunch and so she strolled up to 2 wickham place as being the most likely place for the missing article
p03385_B,03385,B,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p03386_B,03386,B,i don t know what s to be done tibby i am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns meg and do not want to face her and i am not going back to wickham place i stopped here to tell you this give meg my love and say that i want to be alone i mean to go to munich or else bonn
p03387_B,03387,B,not nearly half i have far too much and we settled at chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet what i give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two it isn t enough i didn t expect you to understand me
p03388_B,03388,B,then there s nothing to be done i dare say you are right let them marry there remains the question of compensation
p03389_B,03389,B,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p03390_B,03390,B,this part is in confidence it has nothing to do with meg and do not mention it to her the compensation i do not see who is to pay it if i don t and i have already decided on the minimum sum as soon as possible i am placing it to your account and when i am in germany you will pay it over for me i shall never forget your kindness tibbikins if you do this
p03391_B,03391,B,i have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude
p03392_B,03392,B,oh you know best but he is practical
p03393_B,03393,B,it is extraordinary
p03394_B,03394,B,perhaps he has come across that sort of thing
p03395_B,03395,B,and i want civilisation without activity which i expect is what we shall find in the other place
p03396_B,03396,B,has nobody arst you
p03397_B,03397,B,labouring under such a delusion why do you not marry
p03398_B,03398,B,oh goodness me meg
p03399_B,03399,B,ye es
p03400_B,03400,B,that house being the w s house i presume
p03401_B,03401,B,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p03402_B,03402,B,no no oh no
p03403_B,03403,B,london then
p03404_B,03404,B,do people ask helen
p03405_B,03405,B,who are the wilcoxes
p03406_B,03406,B,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p03407_B,03407,B,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p03408_B,03408,B,spare me the wilcoxes
p03409_B,03409,B,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p03410_B,03410,B,i like guy and mr vyse most
p03411_B,03411,B,none unless it s something mental
p03412_B,03412,B,who are the w s
p03413_B,03413,B,what it is
p03414_B,03414,B,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p03415_B,03415,B,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p03416_B,03416,B,how tired one gets after music
p03417_B,03417,B,do you go there much
p03418_B,03418,B,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p03419_B,03419,B,where did we meet mr bast for the minute i don t remember
p03420_B,03420,B,oh i would be so grateful
p03421_B,03421,B,and went into a bank instead
p03422_B,03422,B,i mean by big a solid well established concern that offers a reasonably good career to its employes
p03423_B,03423,B,so do i you were that last sunday you are this to day mr bast i and my sister have talked you over we wanted to help you we also supposed you might help us we did not have you here out of charity which bores us but because we hoped there would be a connection between last sunday and other days what is the good of your stars and trees your sunrise and the wind if they do not enter into our daily lives they have never entered into mine but into yours we thought haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness against pettiness against mechanical cheerfulness against suspicion i struggle by remembering my friends others i have known by remembering some place some beloved place or tree we thought you one of these
p03424_B,03424,B,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p03425_B,03425,B,but not good country there is it
p03426_B,03426,B,won t you have something to eat i don t know what to do it isn t my house and though mr wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time as i say i don t know what to do but i undertake to do what i can for you helen offer them something do try a sandwich mrs bast
p03427_B,03427,B,that is where we live if you preferred you could call for the umbrella after the concert but i didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault
p03428_B,03428,B,yes horribly
p03429_B,03429,B,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p03430_B,03430,B,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p03431_B,03431,B,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p03432_B,03432,B,heavens no
p03433_B,03433,B,the beethoven s fine i don t like the brahms though nor the mendelssohn that came first and ugh i don t like this elgar that s coming
p03434_B,03434,B,why better
p03435_B,03435,B,i quite agree and that s why i was curious to know is it a solid well established concern
p03436_B,03436,B,we would like to find you work we want to i like my sister you re only down in your luck go to the hotel have a good night s rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
p03437_B,03437,B,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p03438_B,03438,B,how so to speak
p03439_B,03439,B,so should i now my sister declares they re just the same we have great arguments over it she says i m dense i say she s sloppy now doesn t it seem absurd to you what is the good of the arts if they re interchangeable what is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music it s very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process but what s gained i d like to know oh it s all rubbish radically false if monet s really debussy and debussy s really monet neither gentleman is worth his salt that s my opinion now this very symphony that we ve just been having she won t let it alone she labels it with meanings from start to finish turns it into literature i wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music yet i don t know there s my brother behind us he treats music as music and oh my goodness he makes me angrier than any one simply furious with him i daren t even argue but of course the real villain is wagner he has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts i do feel that music is in a very serious state just now though extraordinarily interesting every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses like wagner who stir up all the wells of thought at once for a moment it s splendid such a splash as never was but afterwards such a lot of mud and the wells as it were they communicate with each other too easily now and not one of them will run quite clear that s what wagner s done
p03440_B,03440,B,oh don t let us mind
p03441_B,03441,B,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
p03442_B,03442,B,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p03443_B,03443,B,but of course it is tibby tibby
p03444_B,03444,B,your company is the porphyrion isn t it
p03445_B,03445,B,oh good
p03446_B,03446,B,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p03447_B,03447,B,no i can t say i do
p03448_B,03448,B,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p03449_B,03449,B,where did you start from do tell us more
p03450_B,03450,B,so you like carlyle
p03451_B,03451,B,if you would give me your address
p03452_B,03452,B,and don t think i m not serious because i don t use the traditional arguments making money a sphere awaiting you and so on all of which are for various reasons cant i m only your sister i haven t any authority over you and i don t want to have any just to put before you what i think the truth you see in a few years we shall be the same age practically and i shall want you to help me men are so much nicer than women
p03453_B,03453,B,oh that quite impossible
p03454_B,03454,B,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p03455_B,03455,B,tibby love what next
p03456_B,03456,B,helen may be right
p03457_B,03457,B,they were men who had nothing better to do so take warning you must work or else you must pretend to work which is what i do work work work if you d save your soul and your body it is honestly a necessity dear boy look at the wilcoxes look at mr pembroke with all their defects of temper and understanding such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly
p03458_B,03458,B,only ninnies
p03459_B,03459,B,i was thinking of the younger son whom i once classed as a ninny but who came back so ill from nigeria he s gone out there again evie wilcox tells me out to his duty he doesn t want the money it is work he wants though it is beastly work dull country dishonest natives an eternal fidget over fresh water and food a nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud no wonder england has become an empire
p03460_B,03460,B,then we ll leave the subject till you do i m not going to rattle you round take your time only do think over the lives of the men you like most and see how they ve arranged them
p03461_B,03461,B,but mr vyse is rather a wretched weedy man don t you think then there s guy that was a pitiful business besides every one is the better for some regular work i shall stick to it i am not saying it to educate you it is what i really think i believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work and they must not starve it it s a new desire it goes with a great deal that s bad but in itself it s good and i hope that for women too not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago
p03462_B,03462,B,no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t
p03463_B,03463,B,what it is worse luck i want activity without civilisation how paradoxical yet i expect that is what we shall find in heaven
p03464_B,03464,B,about helen
p03465_B,03465,B,i shall not they are the right sort
p03466_B,03466,B,i agree but helen rather wants to get away from london however there s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a flat in town provided we all stick together and contribute though of course oh how one does maunder on and to think to think of the people who are really poor how do they live not to move about the world would kill me
p03467_B,03467,B,dear your judgment s often clearer than mine have you any notion what s at the back
p03468_B,03468,B,tibby love you must go
p03469_B,03469,B,leave tibby alone
p03470_B,03470,B,well they re as near the right sort as you can imagine
p03471_B,03471,B,he would do all he could but
p03472_B,03472,B,i sometimes jolly well think i would if i got the chance
p03473_B,03473,B,it is impossible because it s not the particular language that helen and i talk if you see my meaning it would do splendidly for other people whom i don t blame
p03474_B,03474,B,oh mrs wilcox i have made the baddest blunder i am more more ashamed and sorry than i can say i knew he was going to india in november but i forgot
p03475_B,03475,B,you needn t go as far as the other place tibbikins if you want that you can find it at oxford
p03476_B,03476,B,when my work permits i attend the gallery for the royal opera this year i have been three times to faust tosca and
p03477_B,03477,B,wrong so to speak
p03478_B,03478,B,thank you
p03479_B,03479,B,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p03480_B,03480,B,oh well enough
p03481_B,03481,B,that s right
p03482_B,03482,B,yes the mistake arose it was a mistake
p03483_B,03483,B,but surely the atmosphere of covent garden is even more oppressive
p03484_B,03484,B,it depends on what you call big
p03485_B,03485,B,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p03486_B,03486,B,well that was how it happened you see
p03487_B,03487,B,yes but i want i wanted have you ever read the ordeal of richard feverel it s a beautiful book i wanted to get back to the earth don t you see like richard does in the end or have you ever read stevenson s prince otto that s another beautiful book you get back to the earth in that i wanted i walked all the saturday night i walked
p03488_B,03488,B,might i couldn t i
p03489_B,03489,B,it s a fine programme this afternoon is it not
p03490_B,03490,B,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p03491_B,03491,B,no it is better not to risk a second interview i shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life really i mean this we can never repeat it has done me real good and there we had better leave it
p03492_B,03492,B,it was gas lamps for hours still i had all the night and being out was the great thing i did get into woods too presently
p03493_B,03493,B,that s so calling too a mistake
p03494_B,03494,B,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p03495_B,03495,B,i i should have thought so kind of
p03496_B,03496,B,it was something else i was somewhere else to what you think so there
p03497_B,03497,B,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all
p03498_B,03498,B,it isn t of any consequence
p03499_B,03499,B,not at all
p03500_B,03500,B,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p03501_B,03501,B,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p03502_B,03502,B,i suppose my umbrella will be all right i don t really mind about it i will think about music instead i suppose my umbrella will be all right shall i try to do without a programme
p03503_B,03503,B,no i shall not it s better like this
p03504_B,03504,B,i took the underground to wimbledon as i came out of the office i said to myself i must have a walk once in a way if i don t take this walk now i shall never take it i had a bit of dinner at wimbledon and then
p03505_B,03505,B,do you find the atmosphere of queen s hall oppressive
p03506_B,03506,B,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p03507_B,03507,B,i fail to see the connection
p03508_B,03508,B,oh not at all not at all
p03509_B,03509,B,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat

p03574_B,03574,B,all right jacky nothing i m reading a book
p03575_B,03575,B,and there will even be some one for tibby there now tibby think of that frieda is saving up a little girl for you in pig tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries i ve talked too much my head aches now you talk
p03576_B,03576,B,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p03577_B,03577,B,come helen
p03578_B,03578,B,most certainly her love has died
p03579_B,03579,B,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her
p03580_B,03580,B,ever so many thanks
p03581_B,03581,B,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p03582_B,03582,B,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p03583_B,03583,B,yes i know thanks very much
p03584_B,03584,B,i thought i did right to tell you
p03585_B,03585,B,but how horrible
p03586_B,03586,B,i should like to give you something worth your acquaintance miss schlegel in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight it has so happened that i have been left alone and you have stopped me from brooding i am too apt to brood
p03587_B,03587,B,at howards end yes there is nothing to get up for in london
p03588_B,03588,B,so you think
p03589_B,03589,B,i almost think
p03590_B,03590,B,i wonder i wondered at heidelberg
p03591_B,03591,B,it is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind the christmas cards especially i do admire your choice my husband and evie will be back the day after to morrow that is why i dragged you out shopping to day i stayed in town chiefly to shop but got through nothing and now he writes that they must cut their tour short the weather is so bad and the police traps have been so bad nearly as bad as in surrey ours is such a careful chauffeur and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road hogs
p03592_B,03592,B,i don t know i don t know
p03593_B,03593,B,i can hardly imagine charles in italy
p03594_B,03594,B,do you think that the tree really did cure toothache if one believed in it
p03595_B,03595,B,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p03596_B,03596,B,indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself
p03597_B,03597,B,oh yes i m sure i always sound uncertain over things it is my way of speaking
p03598_B,03598,B,he sailed on the 17th for nigeria in africa
p03599_B,03599,B,oh no he often my paul is very young you see
p03600_B,03600,B,i think so
p03601_B,03601,B,is it i am only used to country christmases
p03602_B,03602,B,there is nothing to be gained by discussing that
p03603_B,03603,B,no please stop a little longer i am taking a day in bed now and then i do
p03604_B,03604,B,surely something could be done
p03605_B,03605,B,the lease i mean
p03606_B,03606,B,the pony oh dead ever so long ago
p03607_B,03607,B,it doesn t matter miss schlegel it is good of you to have come round so promptly
p03608_B,03608,B,an instinct which may be wrong
p03609_B,03609,B,i am used to young people i hear a great deal of chatter at home for we like you entertain a great deal with us it is more sport and politics but i enjoyed my lunch very much miss schlegel dear and am not pretending and only wish i could have joined in more for one thing i m not particularly well just to day for another you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me charles is the same dolly the same but we are all in the same boat old and young i never forget that
p03610_B,03610,B,i thought we would go to harrods or the haymarket stores everything is sure to be there i am not a good shopper the din is so confusing and your aunt is quite right one ought to make a list take my notebook then and write your own name at the top of the page
p03611_B,03611,B,you will be very sorry to leave it
p03612_B,03612,B,these are indeed other words i had nothing so coherent in my head i was merely alarmed when i knew that my boy cared for your sister
p03613_B,03613,B,come down with me to howards end now i want you to see it you have never seen it i want to hear what you say about it for you do put things so wonderfully
p03614_B,03614,B,yes you have got it inexperience is the word
p03615_B,03615,B,certainly i remember cases you see i lived at howards end long long before mr wilcox knew it i was born there good bye miss schlegel good bye thank you for coming you have cheered me up
p03616_B,03616,B,yes charles my elder son is married
p03617_B,03617,B,back to wickham place please
p03618_B,03618,B,it cannot stand without them it cannot stand without them and i sometimes think but i cannot expect your generation to agree for even my daughter disagrees with me here
p03619_B,03619,B,yes my husband built a little one only last month to the west of the house not far from the wych elm in what used to be the paddock for the pony
p03620_B,03620,B,you are coming to sleep dear too it is in the morning that my house is most beautiful you are coming to stop i cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise these fogs never spread far i dare say they are sitting in the sun in hertfordshire and you will never repent joining them
p03621_B,03621,B,i did think it best
p03622_B,03622,B,that s a most difficult question i think you put it best in your letter it was an instinct which may be wrong
p03623_B,03623,B,yes quite
p03624_B,03624,B,you spoke of your next house miss schlegel then are you leaving wickham place
p03625_B,03625,B,i sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men
p03626_B,03626,B,the truth is i am a little tired first came the wedding and then paul went off and instead of resting yesterday i paid a round of calls
p03627_B,03627,B,it is monstrous miss schlegel it isn t right i had no idea that this was hanging over you i do pity you from the bottom of my heart to be parted from your house your father s house it oughtn t to be allowed it is worse than dying i would rather die than oh poor girls can what they call civilisation be right if people mayn t die in the room where they were born my dear i am so sorry howards end was nearly pulled down once it would have killed me
p03628_B,03628,B,i i wonder whether you ever think about yourself
p03629_B,03629,B,it is the same
p03630_B,03630,B,if possible something distinctive
p03631_B,03631,B,i was certainly against taking mrs matheson s flat i knew it was opposite your house
p03632_B,03632,B,i do not mean it as a snub your last speech interested me so much generally people do not seem quite to like germany i have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side
p03633_B,03633,B,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p03634_B,03634,B,it is the finest wych elm in hertfordshire did your sister tell you about the teeth
p03635_B,03635,B,i suppose not but one would like to perhaps i shall think of something as we go about we always give the servants money
p03636_B,03636,B,he likes travel but he does see through foreigners so what he enjoys most is a motor tour in england and i think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable his father gave him a car for a wedding present which for the present is being stored at howards end
p03637_B,03637,B,they have gone to naples for their honeymoon
p03638_B,03638,B,what an interesting life you all lead in london
p03639_B,03639,B,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p03640_B,03640,B,i only meant that i am fifty one and that to me both of you read it all in some book or other i cannot put things clearly
p03641_B,03641,B,she gone as well yes certainly it is quite safe safe absolutely now
p03642_B,03642,B,have you been there long
p03643_B,03643,B,if that is so if i have happened to be of use to you which i didn t know you cannot pay me back with anything tangible
p03644_B,03644,B,oh hooray how very kind of you to start with me i don t really want a yuletide gift though in fact i d rather not
p03645_B,03645,B,nothing to get up for when there are all the autumn exhibitions and ysaye playing in the afternoon not to mention people
p03646_B,03646,B,i howards end must be a very different house to ours we are fond of ours but there is nothing distinctive about it as you saw it is an ordinary london house we shall easily find another
p03647_B,03647,B,i m twenty nine that s not so wildly girlish what makes you say that do you mean that i have been gauche and rude
p03648_B,03648,B,i m sure
p03649_B,03649,B,not at all
p03650_B,03650,B,first of all we must make a list and tick off the people s names my aunt always does and this fog may thicken up any moment have you any ideas
p03651_B,03651,B,doesn t he care for travelling
p03652_B,03652,B,of course it did it would cure anything once
p03653_B,03653,B,yes thank you i heard on tuesday only on tuesday for they live right away at stettin did you ever know any one living at stettin
p03654_B,03654,B,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p03655_B,03655,B,that s all right and i m sure too i must say good bye now you will be getting up
p03656_B,03656,B,i knew i know i have been too absurd all through i am very much ashamed i am more sorry than i can say and i hope that you will forgive me
p03657_B,03657,B,then what was it
p03658_B,03658,B,you only think you aren t sure i do love these little muddles tidied up
p03659_B,03659,B,no values have risen too enormously they mean to pull down wickham place and build flats like yours
p03660_B,03660,B,mrs wilcox were you very angry with us last june i wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it
p03661_B,03661,B,i thought of you as one of the early risers
p03662_B,03662,B,oh the lease have you been thinking of that all the time how very kind of you
p03663_B,03663,B,again my lack of experience i suppose i can t say anything when you take up that line mrs wilcox i wish i could see myself as you see me foreshortened into a backfisch quite the ingenue very charming wonderfully well read for my age but incapable
p03664_B,03664,B,the wych elm i remember helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree
p03665_B,03665,B,it does matter i have been rude to you and my sister is not even at home so there was not even that excuse
p03666_B,03666,B,in other words they belong to types that can fall in love but couldn t live together that s dreadfully probable i m afraid that in nine cases out of ten nature pulls one way and human nature another
p03667_B,03667,B,so i say but helen who will muddle things says no it s like music the course of the oder is to be like music it s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem the part by the landing stage is in b minor if i remember rightly but lower down things get extremely mixed there is a slodgy theme in several keys at once meaning mud banks and another for the navigable canal and the exit into the baltic is in c sharp major pianissimo
p03668_B,03668,B,then you ought to discussion keeps a house alive it cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone
p03669_B,03669,B,i shall never repent joining you
p03670_B,03670,B,ah i have always been wanting to ask you how did you know helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up and you stepped forward and arranged things did paul tell you
p03671_B,03671,B,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p03672_B,03672,B,i m so glad
p03673_B,03673,B,are you quite certain that i m not interrupting mrs wilcox
p03674_B,03674,B,i beg your pardon
p03675_B,03675,B,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p03676_B,03676,B,where s the pony gone
p03677_B,03677,B,he was exceeding the speed limit i conclude he must expect to suffer with the lower animals i will come if i still may
p03678_B,03678,B,now why
p03679_B,03679,B,it wasn t that your son still
p03680_B,03680,B,then i will stay i m enjoying this
p03681_B,03681,B,we are usually in london and play the game with vigour carols at the abbey clumsy midday meal clumsy dinner for the maids followed by christmas tree and dancing of poor children with songs from helen the drawing room does very well for that we put the tree in the powder closet and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted and with the looking glass behind it looks quite pretty i wish we might have a powder closet in our next house of course the tree has to be very small and the presents don t hang on it no the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper
p03682_B,03682,B,never mind us or her do say
p03683_B,03683,B,a wedding
p03684_B,03684,B,landlords are horrible
p03685_B,03685,B,i think of nothing else
p03686_B,03686,B,yes in two or three years when the lease expires we must
p03687_B,03687,B,i suppose so we scarcely realise it yet my father
p03688_B,03688,B,but it s all right now
p03689_B,03689,B,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p03690_B,03690,B,the other side then you do disagree oh good give us your side
p03691_B,03691,B,i should i love folklore and all festering superstitions
p03692_B,03692,B,yes do you yes much easier no i do like christmas on the whole in its clumsy way it does approach peace and goodwill but oh it is clumsier every year
p03693_B,03693,B,i suppose you have a garage there
p03694_B,03694,B,lucky people
p03695_B,03695,B,no we don t we lead the lives of gibbering monkeys mrs wilcox really we have something quiet and stable at the bottom we really have all my friends have don t pretend you enjoyed lunch for you loathed it but forgive me by coming again alone or by asking me to you
p03696_B,03696,B,on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form
p03697_B,03697,B,oh i ve got it inexperience i m no better than helen you mean and yet i presume to advise her
p03698_B,03698,B,you ve been worrying too how perfectly extraordinary i can see that you have you felt as i do helen mustn t meet him again
p03699_B,03699,B,all our lives
p03700_B,03700,B,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p03701_B,03701,B,is anything gained by that
p03702_B,03702,B,i am not sure that i agree do you
p03703_B,03703,B,they make a great deal of it i think it s affectation to compare the oder to music and so do you but the overhanging warehouses of stettin take beauty seriously which we don t and the average englishman doesn t and despises all who do now don t say germans have no taste or i shall scream they haven t but but such a tremendous but they take poetry seriously they do take poetry seriously
p03704_B,03704,B,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p03705_B,03705,B,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p03706_B,03706,B,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p03707_B,03707,B,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p03708_B,03708,B,are they i never follow any arguments i am only too thankful not to have a vote myself
p03709_B,03709,B,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p03710_B,03710,B,bertha too oh fancy what a coincidence do you know i ll wait on second thoughts i ll wait there s plenty of time still isn t there and i shall be able to get evie s opinion

p03741_B,03741,B,look here father you must eat you know
p03742_B,03742,B,i must make a note of that i am surprised that the rector allowed it

p03765_B,03765,B,howards end
p03766_B,03766,B,yes dear
p03767_B,03767,B,you did
p03768_B,03768,B,it s all very well to turn the conversation but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as evie was there to make him comfortable but you must needs start match making besides cahill s too old
p03769_B,03769,B,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p03770_B,03770,B,who asked him while i was away who asked my sister down to meet him who sent them out in the motor day after day

p03774_B,03774,B,got what what the dickens are you talking about
p03775_B,03775,B,we re in a bad hole and must make the best of it i shall answer the pater s letter civilly he s evidently anxious to do the decent thing but i do not intend to forget these schlegels in a hurry as long as they re on their best behaviour dolly are you listening we ll behave too but if i find them giving themselves airs or monopolising my father or at all ill treating him or worrying him with their artistic beastliness i intend to put my foot down yes firmly taking my mother s place heaven knows what poor old paul will say when the news reaches him
p03776_B,03776,B,another point i must speak to chalkeley
p03777_B,03777,B,it s your fault and five months ago you admitted it
p03778_B,03778,B,i keep on telling you howards end miss schlegel s got it
p03779_B,03779,B,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p03780_B,03780,B,i call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair you couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting could he diddums
p03781_B,03781,B,oh no the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her
p03782_B,03782,B,now charles you promised not to say those naughty
p03783_B,03783,B,howards end
p03784_B,03784,B,i didn t know one could pollard elms i thought one only pollarded willows
p03785_B,03785,B,why you just said it was
p03786_B,03786,B,charles that reminds me of some poem
p03787_B,03787,B,but you haven t listened charles
p03788_B,03788,B,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p03789_B,03789,B,i tell you i keep on telling you miss schlegel she s got it your mother s left it to her and you ve all got to move out
p03790_B,03790,B,of course if you re going to be rude to uncle percy
p03791_B,03791,B,i could simply scratch that woman s eyes out and to say it s my fault is most unfair
p03792_B,03792,B,she wants howards end
p03793_B,03793,B,tootle tootle playing on the pootle
p03794_B,03794,B,i didn t
p03795_B,03795,B,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p03796_B,03796,B,no sir no one s had the motor out sir
p03797_B,03797,B,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p03798_B,03798,B,has it sir
p03799_B,03799,B,the gardener sir
p03800_B,03800,B,no sir
p03801_B,03801,B,do you mean to tell me that old penny can drive a motor
p03802_B,03802,B,now dolly i can attend to you miss schlegel what does she want
p03803_B,03803,B,now mind you don t forget for i come little woman
p03804_B,03804,B,yes and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly for there s mud on the axle take it off
p03805_B,03805,B,then how do you account for the mud on the axle
p03806_B,03806,B,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p03807_B,03807,B,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p03808_B,03808,B,oh mr wilcox
p03809_B,03809,B,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p03810_B,03810,B,i told you not to go out to the garage i ve heard you all shouting in the garden i won t have it come in into the dining room every one of you we can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants here charles here read these see what you make
p03811_B,03811,B,give it her
p03812_B,03812,B,we know that it is not legally binding dolly we are aware of that legally i should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire of course my dear we consider you as one of the family but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand
p03813_B,03813,B,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p03814_B,03814,B,well let s sit down
p03815_B,03815,B,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p03816_B,03816,B,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p03817_B,03817,B,don t think what
p03818_B,03818,B,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p03819_B,03819,B,my dear father consult an expert if you like but i don t admit it is my mother s writing
p03820_B,03820,B,that time may prove
p03821_B,03821,B,certainly i was coming out to you when dolly
p03822_B,03822,B,come evie don t waste time sit down
p03823_B,03823,B,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p03824_B,03824,B,has he done it any harm
p03825_B,03825,B,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p03826_B,03826,B,i don t think that
p03827_B,03827,B,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p03828_B,03828,B,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p03829_B,03829,B,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p03830_B,03830,B,i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood that was awful with gorse bushes i did wish i d never come but suddenly it got light just while i seemed going under one tree then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london
p03831_B,03831,B,because i see one must have money
p03832_B,03832,B,i don t want your patronage i don t want your tea i was quite happy what do you want to unsettle me for i put it to this gentleman i ask you sir am i to have my brain picked
p03833_B,03833,B,nearly three years
p03834_B,03834,B,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p03835_B,03835,B,i am as afraid of death as any one
p03836_B,03836,B,but mr wilcox he is not perhaps
p03837_B,03837,B,no oh no miss schlegel no
p03838_B,03838,B,ladies brighten
p03839_B,03839,B,i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her
p03840_B,03840,B,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p03841_B,03841,B,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p03842_B,03842,B,i don t call that fair i know what you mean and it isn t so
p03843_B,03843,B,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark
p03844_B,03844,B,i ve got to be going now
p03845_B,03845,B,yes but we d been talking it over at the office there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed
p03846_B,03846,B,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p03847_B,03847,B,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking
p03848_B,03848,B,i can never thank you sufficiently miss schlegel
p03849_B,03849,B,yes thank you miss schlegel
p03850_B,03850,B,oh i walked
p03851_B,03851,B,jacky let s go we re more bother than we re worth we re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us and they never will there s nothing we re good enough to do
p03852_B,03852,B,i wonder
p03853_B,03853,B,lincolnshire mostly but my mother s father he oddly enough came from these parts round here
p03854_B,03854,B,i get no time for reading
p03855_B,03855,B,i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream
p03856_B,03856,B,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p03857_B,03857,B,and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too i m glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say and besides you can believe me or not as you choose i was very hungry that dinner at wimbledon i meant it to last me all night like other dinners i never thought that walking would make such a difference why when you re walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines lord i did feel bad looking back it wasn t what you may call enjoyment it was more a case of sticking to it i did stick i i was determined oh hang it all what s the good i mean the good of living in a room for ever there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside if it s only nothing particular after all
p03858_B,03858,B,it s better she stops in her room
p03859_B,03859,B,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not
p03860_B,03860,B,i don t know nor for how long it got too dark to see my watch
p03861_B,03861,B,the more a lady has to say the better
p03862_B,03862,B,but what is the difference
p03863_B,03863,B,call what call
p03864_B,03864,B,in the afternoon of course
p03865_B,03865,B,curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies
p03866_B,03866,B,oh just settle down
p03867_B,03867,B,quite so quite so
p03868_B,03868,B,no the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention
p03869_B,03869,B,walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful
p03870_B,03870,B,you ask me why i turn on you
p03871_B,03871,B,they were just nothing at all agricultural labourers and that sort
p03872_B,03872,B,i must be stupid
p03873_B,03873,B,well i lost it entirely first of all the street lamps then the trees and towards morning it got cloudy
p03874_B,03874,B,i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists
p03875_B,03875,B,may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i
p03876_B,03876,B,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p03877_B,03877,B,they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether
p03878_B,03878,B,things so often get spoiled
p03879_B,03879,B,then you don t think i was foolish
p03880_B,03880,B,no thank you she does not need company
p03881_B,03881,B,and your sister too
p03882_B,03882,B,i hate all this
p03883_B,03883,B,i said to my wife i said to mrs bast and mrs bast said to me while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you
p03884_B,03884,B,oh i don t know
p03885_B,03885,B,because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common
p03886_B,03886,B,it s work he wants can t you see
p03887_B,03887,B,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i
p03888_B,03888,B,i call that a very rude remark what do you want to turn on me like that for
p03889_B,03889,B,just a grey evening turned upside down i know
p03890_B,03890,B,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men
p03891_B,03891,B,settle down to what
p03892_B,03892,B,yes but the wood this ere wood how did you get out of it
p03893_B,03893,B,how long have you been married
p03894_B,03894,B,well you re wrong
p03895_B,03895,B,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p03896_B,03896,B,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p03897_B,03897,B,did you actually go off the roads
p03898_B,03898,B,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p03899_B,03899,B,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p03900_B,03900,B,but was the dawn wonderful
p03901_B,03901,B,i know but people don t go then perhaps you know best but never forget you re better than jefferies
p03902_B,03902,B,but not of the idea of death
p03903_B,03903,B,then why
p03904_B,03904,B,how far
p03905_B,03905,B,i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that
p03906_B,03906,B,mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you
p03907_B,03907,B,from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast
p03908_B,03908,B,oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle
p03909_B,03909,B,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever
p03910_B,03910,B,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p03911_B,03911,B,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p03912_B,03912,B,of course
p03913_B,03913,B,of course all presentable people say i
p03914_B,03914,B,were you walking alone may i ask
p03915_B,03915,B,yes i know the darlings are regular sunbeams let me give you a plate
p03916_B,03916,B,infinite difference
p03917_B,03917,B,this afternoon call
p03918_B,03918,B,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p03919_B,03919,B,no it wasn t foolish you ve pushed back the boundaries i think it splendid of you
p03920_B,03920,B,my good boy what a mess who are your people and your grandparents
p03921_B,03921,B,i should just think you ought
p03922_B,03922,B,why not
p03923_B,03923,B,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p03924_B,03924,B,so from which part
p03925_B,03925,B,death destroys a man the idea of death saves him so never give in
p03926_B,03926,B,yes go on
p03927_B,03927,B,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either
p03928_B,03928,B,mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired
p03929_B,03929,B,but play with puppies a little first
p03930_B,03930,B,excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now
p03931_B,03931,B,oh yes
p03932_B,03932,B,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p03933_B,03933,B,what did your people say
p03934_B,03934,B,shall i sit up with her
p03935_B,03935,B,had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life
p03936_B,03936,B,no inconvenience but i still don t understand i still don t understand when did you say you paid this call
p03937_B,03937,B,and that s to be life how can you with all the beautiful things to see and do with music with walking at night
p03938_B,03938,B,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p03939_B,03939,B,s saturday
p03940_B,03940,B,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p03941_B,03941,B,well at all events she doesn t know about that card yah done her there

p03943_B,03943,B,len who s miss schlegel
p03944_B,03944,B,len i do think you might explain
p03945_B,03945,B,hullo len what ho len
p03946_B,03946,B,wasn t a million your capital dear me we ought to have settled that still it doesn t matter whatever you ve got i order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each
p03947_B,03947,B,your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument why not give him the money itself you re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year
p03948_B,03948,B,have i i thought i had a million
p03949_B,03949,B,personal supervision and mutual help
p03950_B,03950,B,but that would be pauperising them
p03951_B,03951,B,not if you gave them so much a big windfall would not pauperise a man it is these little driblets distributed among too many that do the harm money s educational it s far more educational than the things it buys in a sense well isn t the most civilized thing going the man who has learnt to wear his income properly give them a chance give them money don t dole them out poetry books and railway tickets like babies give them the wherewithal to buy these things when your socialism comes it may be different and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash till it comes give people cash for it is the warp of civilisation whatever the woof may be the imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly for it s the the second most important thing in the world it is so slurred over and hushed up there is so little clear thinking oh political economy of course but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means money give mr bast money and don t bother about his ideals he ll pick up those for himself nothing but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world
p03952_B,03952,B,i see your point if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys only in the spring let us look before we leap i will take warning by evie and not hurry you remember that you have a free hand this time these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive
p03953_B,03953,B,oh yes
p03954_B,03954,B,no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end
p03955_B,03955,B,she cannot be left alone
p03956_B,03956,B,have you anything else to ask me henry
p03957_B,03957,B,it is

p03959_B,03959,B,henry dear henry dear look at me no i won t have you shirking look at me there that s all
p03960_B,03960,B,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses

p03962_B,03962,B,have i time
p03963_B,03963,B,you ll never believe me it s all right now but it was my sister
p03964_B,03964,B,my dear henry did you see them
p03965_B,03965,B,ye es
p03966_B,03966,B,no of course of course
p03967_B,03967,B,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon
p03968_B,03968,B,is miss avery uneducated classes
p03969_B,03969,B,oh jolly
p03970_B,03970,B,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby
p03971_B,03971,B,what s happened
p03972_B,03972,B,don t you know your income or don t you want to tell it me
p03973_B,03973,B,i don t mean ducie street howards end of course
p03974_B,03974,B,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p03975_B,03975,B,i do firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out secondly he cares for something special in adventure it is quickest to call that special something poetry
p03976_B,03976,B,his wife is an old bore he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us
p03977_B,03977,B,i suppose so
p03978_B,03978,B,you re ridiculous helen
p03979_B,03979,B,that would be most kind
p03980_B,03980,B,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me
p03981_B,03981,B,no i have nothing to say but you may talk if there is this nasty curve couldn t we walk to the church not of course you and evie but the rest of us might very well go on first and that would mean fewer carriages
p03982_B,03982,B,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow
p03983_B,03983,B,i am going to germany with my sister i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home our talk last night was more important than you have realised i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you
p03984_B,03984,B,if possible something permanent i can t be as young as i was for these alterations don t suit me
p03985_B,03985,B,it s madness when i say it but not when you say it
p03986_B,03986,B,good bye and it s you i thank
p03987_B,03987,B,for all i know she has seen one already
p03988_B,03988,B,would you ring the bell please
p03989_B,03989,B,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending
p03990_B,03990,B,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means
p03991_B,03991,B,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end
p03992_B,03992,B,why did he go so suddenly
p03993_B,03993,B,he said so and about such a thing he wouldn t lie that s where i differ from you men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort
p03994_B,03994,B,no after houses i m hungry not tired i want to eat heaps
p03995_B,03995,B,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question
p03996_B,03996,B,i told you last night
p03997_B,03997,B,i hadn t thought of that
p03998_B,03998,B,rather than wait to make sure
p03999_B,03999,B,i hate this continual flux of london it is an epitome of us at our worst eternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming away streaming streaming for ever that s why i dread it so i mistrust rivers even in scenery now the sea
p04000_B,04000,B,leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference
p04001_B,04001,B,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast
p04002_B,04002,B,so that
p04003_B,04003,B,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p04004_B,04004,B,no business they wanted to see me and later on i want to talk to you about them
p04005_B,04005,B,ye es semi rubbish are those cruikshanks
p04006_B,04006,B,i little thought then certainly did you
p04007_B,04007,B,poor fellow
p04008_B,04008,B,she s overtired
p04009_B,04009,B,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery
p04010_B,04010,B,obviously unfair i was only thinking how tangled things are it s our fault mostly neither yours nor his
p04011_B,04011,B,dempster s bank
p04012_B,04012,B,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane
p04013_B,04013,B,i am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the george helen would not have left unless she had heard something i mismanaged that it is wretched i ought to have parted her from that woman at once
p04014_B,04014,B,and you chew the bark for toothache
p04015_B,04015,B,not at all
p04016_B,04016,B,really and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea how strange are the ways of fate
p04017_B,04017,B,of wanting to make money out of him
p04018_B,04018,B,why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever evie never told me
p04019_B,04019,B,i should enjoy that
p04020_B,04020,B,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things
p04021_B,04021,B,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us we re nearly demented
p04022_B,04022,B,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills
p04023_B,04023,B,why not
p04024_B,04024,B,i forget
p04025_B,04025,B,you have mentioned mrs wilcox
p04026_B,04026,B,it s quite impossible
p04027_B,04027,B,stop that at least
p04028_B,04028,B,i have naturally nothing to say to her i am going to bed will you tell the servants about helen could some one go to carry her bag you must make more noise than that if you want them to hear
p04029_B,04029,B,i never even asked her who seduced her
p04030_B,04030,B,not even that it may be halfway in the wrong direction i can t explain i don t believe in all these fads and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them
p04031_B,04031,B,how will you do that
p04032_B,04032,B,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p04033_B,04033,B,twenty five perhaps
p04034_B,04034,B,i can promise you he s the last he he s rather a special case
p04035_B,04035,B,this is helen s plan not mine
p04036_B,04036,B,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous
p04037_B,04037,B,have you been in the east
p04038_B,04038,B,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him i don t know about later but now the basts must clearly go
p04039_B,04039,B,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off
p04040_B,04040,B,thanks to your hint he s clearing out of the porphyrion
p04041_B,04041,B,the brown bunch was helen but did you catch sight of a sea green and salmon bunch
p04042_B,04042,B,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast
p04043_B,04043,B,look my hands have stopped trembling
p04044_B,04044,B,wednesday no i couldn t well do that aunt juley expects us to stop here another week at least
p04045_B,04045,B,well hide among the ruins and if i can stop them i will
p04046_B,04046,B,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all
p04047_B,04047,B,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property
p04048_B,04048,B,i cannot make it out
p04049_B,04049,B,this visit is a high solemnity my aunt counts on it year after year she turns the house upside down for us she invites our special friends she scarcely knows frieda and we can t leave her on her hands i missed one day and she would be so hurt if i didn t stay the full ten
p04050_B,04050,B,certainly not
p04051_B,04051,B,may i ask you my question now
p04052_B,04052,B,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p04053_B,04053,B,oh yes indeed yes
p04054_B,04054,B,of course not
p04055_B,04055,B,i shouldn t have disliked it perhaps
p04056_B,04056,B,not a bad business
p04057_B,04057,B,well i never in years ago it seemed so far away
p04058_B,04058,B,are we to make her seducer marry her
p04059_B,04059,B,he laughs if i remember correctly
p04060_B,04060,B,well henry send your doctor away what possible use is he now it all turns on affection now affection don t you see surely you see i like helen very much you not so much mr mansbridge doesn t know her that s all and affection when reciprocated gives rights put that down in your note book mr mansbridge it s a useful formula you don t know what you want yourselves for one sensible remark i will let you in but you cannot make it you would trouble my sister for no reason i will not permit it i ll stand here all the day sooner
p04061_B,04061,B,in my absurd way i m lonely too it s heart breaking to leave one s old home i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there helen says
p04062_B,04062,B,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment
p04063_B,04063,B,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again
p04064_B,04064,B,what a change i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you
p04065_B,04065,B,yes i m practical
p04066_B,04066,B,greece was a very good card henry tibby s only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little well done
p04067_B,04067,B,oh my darling yes all right
p04068_B,04068,B,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all
p04069_B,04069,B,when please
p04070_B,04070,B,no you d hate it it s all proteids and body buildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura
p04071_B,04071,B,to have brought this down on you
p04072_B,04072,B,i deny it s madness
p04073_B,04073,B,my old home s falling into pieces henry i only want my new isn t it a perfect evening
p04074_B,04074,B,only some rubbish about furniture helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas just imagine it rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them
p04075_B,04075,B,not exactly
p04076_B,04076,B,perhaps i was not at lunch but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now
p04077_B,04077,B,you haven t found time for a talk with helen yet i suppose
p04078_B,04078,B,then do you really advise us to tell this youth
p04079_B,04079,B,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both
p04080_B,04080,B,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough
p04081_B,04081,B,why to inquire i ll go thank you
p04082_B,04082,B,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son
p04083_B,04083,B,never heard of an aura oh happy happy man i scrub at mine for hours nor of an astral plane just so luckily it was helen s aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went
p04084_B,04084,B,perhaps it does make life more human
p04085_B,04085,B,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily
p04086_B,04086,B,forgive me but i will not
p04087_B,04087,B,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it
p04088_B,04088,B,i don t know what it is all about let s come in
p04089_B,04089,B,except for some practical reason never
p04090_B,04090,B,the earlier the nicer henry females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer
p04091_B,04091,B,mayn t i come too
p04092_B,04092,B,no but none of you are there
p04093_B,04093,B,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement
p04094_B,04094,B,the alexandrina
p04095_B,04095,B,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right
p04096_B,04096,B,go away
p04097_B,04097,B,does however i m concerned with the house not the furniture how big is this smoking room
p04098_B,04098,B,it isn t frittering away the strength it s enlarging the space in which you may be strong
p04099_B,04099,B,is it let s be married from off curzon street who are those people
p04100_B,04100,B,fish pie
p04101_B,04101,B,exactly how indeed just horrible corroding suspicion one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes
p04102_B,04102,B,not to speak about and it s my left hand
p04103_B,04103,B,er no
p04104_B,04104,B,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp
p04105_B,04105,B,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably
p04106_B,04106,B,and how s howards end looking
p04107_B,04107,B,not well
p04108_B,04108,B,why did you go there then
p04109_B,04109,B,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely
p04110_B,04110,B,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases
p04111_B,04111,B,certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass here are your keys
p04112_B,04112,B,yes that s enough dear
p04113_B,04113,B,don t get up she has not come to the wedding i ve bundled her off to the george no she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them
p04114_B,04114,B,i heard of it one winter in london
p04115_B,04115,B,oh even i know a good thing when i see it
p04116_B,04116,B,dear me helen listen to that and he ll have to get another place
p04117_B,04117,B,yes during cigarettes
p04118_B,04118,B,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to
p04119_B,04119,B,gruyere please
p04120_B,04120,B,more right than the porphyrion
p04121_B,04121,B,i could indeed i will when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny but why do you want this settled
p04122_B,04122,B,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p04123_B,04123,B,next september
p04124_B,04124,B,as far as the house never
p04125_B,04125,B,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it
p04126_B,04126,B,did i i mean i did more or less i talk the same way to every one or try to
p04127_B,04127,B,i admit it willingly a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself
p04128_B,04128,B,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one
p04129_B,04129,B,well what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them
p04130_B,04130,B,yes but while they re learning
p04131_B,04131,B,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me
p04132_B,04132,B,still but i thought he was still at epsom they were furnishing that christmas one christmas how everything alters i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often wasn t it epsom
p04133_B,04133,B,naughty cow go away is that you henry henry have you got in
p04134_B,04134,B,oh not five minutes but there s a sting at the end of it for i want you to find the man some work in your office
p04135_B,04135,B,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p04136_B,04136,B,you didn t darling nothing has been done wrong
p04137_B,04137,B,i want to go over the whole house as soon as i get back to swanage which will be to morrow afternoon i ll talk it over once more with helen and tibby and wire you yes or no
p04138_B,04138,B,that too was unnecessary
p04139_B,04139,B,they reduced their staff
p04140_B,04140,B,not in that way
p04141_B,04141,B,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family
p04142_B,04142,B,perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents
p04143_B,04143,B,do you realise that it s all your fault you re responsible
p04144_B,04144,B,oh mr wilcox how can you
p04145_B,04145,B,every one admits that
p04146_B,04146,B,is she
p04147_B,04147,B,ah well mr wilcox aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses
p04148_B,04148,B,horribly hullo parliament s back
p04149_B,04149,B,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends
p04150_B,04150,B,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done
p04151_B,04151,B,are we there already
p04152_B,04152,B,thanks so much you see he has forgiven me
p04153_B,04153,B,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may
p04154_B,04154,B,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man
p04155_B,04155,B,i don t know he s a clerk
p04156_B,04156,B,dolly s uncle
p04157_B,04157,B,very many thanks i m sorry if you sublet
p04158_B,04158,B,be generous to them bother justice
p04159_B,04159,B,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world
p04160_B,04160,B,i have already forgiven you henry
p04161_B,04161,B,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs
p04162_B,04162,B,very much i ve heard so much about it one way or the other aren t there pigs teeth in the wych elm
p04163_B,04163,B,yes we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles justice and even generosity depend on that
p04164_B,04164,B,right shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it that s rather an idea they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management look here yes we ll do that and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire
p04165_B,04165,B,i wasn t as foolish as you suggest she only startled me for the house had been silent so long
p04166_B,04166,B,didn t she send me a message or anything
p04167_B,04167,B,where shall we live then henry i should enjoy living somewhere
p04168_B,04168,B,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him
p04169_B,04169,B,i don t want to hear it my sister is going to be ill my life is going to be with her now we must manage to build up something she and i and her child
p04170_B,04170,B,munich we start after the inquest if she is not too ill
p04171_B,04171,B,go for something for me then
p04172_B,04172,B,a suggestion a seed
p04173_B,04173,B,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself
p04174_B,04174,B,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean
p04175_B,04175,B,but i do budge gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses cow them with an eye and up they come trembling ladies can t it s the houses that are mesmerising me i ve no control over the saucy things houses are alive no
p04176_B,04176,B,stilton because though i don t believe in auras and think theosophy s only a halfway house
p04177_B,04177,B,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that
p04178_B,04178,B,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so
p04179_B,04179,B,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking
p04180_B,04180,B,why does she call you hen has she ever seen you before
p04181_B,04181,B,how could i be offended good bye you will have a letter from me i am going back to swanage to morrow
p04182_B,04182,B,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry
p04183_B,04183,B,shall i
p04184_B,04184,B,here we all are
p04185_B,04185,B,who is we
p04186_B,04186,B,it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess
p04187_B,04187,B,yes he hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed he needs outside interests
p04188_B,04188,B,does all this furniture come from howards end
p04189_B,04189,B,too difficult a question
p04190_B,04190,B,yes heart disease
p04191_B,04191,B,not a bad surely on chelsea embankment
p04192_B,04192,B,of course not you mean money how stupid i am of course not
p04193_B,04193,B,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain
p04194_B,04194,B,i cannot help it do wait it s not my fault please all four of you go away now
p04195_B,04195,B,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice
p04196_B,04196,B,henry i won t go don t bully me
p04197_B,04197,B,how sad it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses
p04198_B,04198,B,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal
p04199_B,04199,B,and some people are lucky enough to have both you re doing yourself proud mr wilcox my congratulations
p04200_B,04200,B,to morrow helen goes to munich
p04201_B,04201,B,but how much have you got
p04202_B,04202,B,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name
p04203_B,04203,B,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you
p04204_B,04204,B,perhaps i have confused it with some other tree there are still a great number of sacred trees in england it seems
p04205_B,04205,B,can t i look after myself i do wish
p04206_B,04206,B,don t ask me i m a plain man of business i live and let live my advice to you both is don t worry margaret you ve got black marks again under your eyes you know that s strictly forbidden first your aunt then your sister no we aren t going to have it are we theobald i ll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband
p04207_B,04207,B,what did he suspect you of
p04208_B,04208,B,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you
p04209_B,04209,B,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles
p04210_B,04210,B,he has at once gone to call on your brother
p04211_B,04211,B,would she not tell you
p04212_B,04212,B,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman
p04213_B,04213,B,no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man
p04214_B,04214,B,funny experiences seem to come to you two girls no one s ever asked me about my what d ye call it perhaps i ve not got one
p04215_B,04215,B,i m out of my depth didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy
p04216_B,04216,B,i was meaning to act for the best
p04217_B,04217,B,i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman certainly
p04218_B,04218,B,why later on tell me now no time like the present
p04219_B,04219,B,oh he s one of that writer sort
p04220_B,04220,B,proteges always are your protege has made us late the fussells will just be starting
p04221_B,04221,B,moderately but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady
p04222_B,04222,B,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once
p04223_B,04223,B,the howards end furniture has all gone to oniton
p04224_B,04224,B,oh very well
p04225_B,04225,B,the motor s come to stay one must get about there s a pretty church oh you aren t sharp enough well look out if the road worries you right outward at the scenery
p04226_B,04226,B,we ve none too much i assure you you re marrying a poor man
p04227_B,04227,B,yes i know and how much of it do you suppose he understood
p04228_B,04228,B,well my dear how am i to know
p04229_B,04229,B,miss schlegel excuse me but i know the type
p04230_B,04230,B,surely he has some opinion
p04231_B,04231,B,you said just now
p04232_B,04232,B,good i did the breaking of the ice
p04233_B,04233,B,yes and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme ah well
p04234_B,04234,B,i see you have scruples
p04235_B,04235,B,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p04236_B,04236,B,margaret my margaret
p04237_B,04237,B,where are you going
p04238_B,04238,B,what a practical little woman it is what s it been reading theo theo how much
p04239_B,04239,B,answer my question plain question plain answer do
p04240_B,04240,B,there s just one question
p04241_B,04241,B,after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there
p04242_B,04242,B,it is no good those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started i have known cases of other men i despised them once i thought that i m different i shall never be tempted oh margaret we fellows all come to grief once in our time will you believe that there are moments when the strongest man that s true isn t it if you knew all you would excuse me i was far from good influences far even from england i was very very lonely and longed for a woman s voice that s enough i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now
p04243_B,04243,B,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps
p04244_B,04244,B,oh ah yes dear would you like one turn in the garden
p04245_B,04245,B,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold
p04246_B,04246,B,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down
p04247_B,04247,B,that s good what ll you have
p04248_B,04248,B,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately
p04249_B,04249,B,you have not been yourself all day
p04250_B,04250,B,i am far from a saint in fact the reverse but you have taken me for better or worse bygones must be bygones you have promised to forgive me margaret a promise is a promise never mention that woman again
p04251_B,04251,B,it s let
p04252_B,04252,B,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p04253_B,04253,B,it isn t meant as a compliment my dear i just won t have you going about in the dark such people about too it s dangerous
p04254_B,04254,B,cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference
p04255_B,04255,B,i perceive you are attempting blackmail it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end
p04256_B,04256,B,ten years ago
p04257_B,04257,B,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit
p04258_B,04258,B,what are his qualifications
p04259_B,04259,B,thirty by fifteen no wait a minute fifteen and a half
p04260_B,04260,B,by the way
p04261_B,04261,B,yes money since you put it so frankly i am determined to be just to all just to you just to them i am determined that my children shall have me
p04262_B,04262,B,madam you will be more comfortable at the hotel
p04263_B,04263,B,no hotels
p04264_B,04264,B,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him
p04265_B,04265,B,i ll do what i can but margaret this mustn t be taken as a precedent
p04266_B,04266,B,you too feel lonely
p04267_B,04267,B,practical you practical
p04268_B,04268,B,what a rum notion of course not
p04269_B,04269,B,i don t know about that i shouldn t like to say
p04270_B,04270,B,yes but they moved eighteen months ago charles the good chap thought i should be lonely i didn t want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills he had a motor too there they all are a very jolly party he and she and the two grandchildren
p04271_B,04271,B,with you
p04272_B,04272,B,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to
p04273_B,04273,B,what about next wednesday
p04274_B,04274,B,yes they are talking again but you were going to say
p04275_B,04275,B,lower classes well you do admit that there are rich and poor that s something you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same the hard working man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom
p04276_B,04276,B,i thought it best to ring up charles
p04277_B,04277,B,i wasn t aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again
p04278_B,04278,B,saddle of mutton and cider to drink that s the type of thing i like this place for a joke once in a way it is so thoroughly old english don t you agree
p04279_B,04279,B,the two cases are different
p04280_B,04280,B,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness
p04281_B,04281,B,i don t agree
p04282_B,04282,B,you re referring to last evening i have released you from your engagement i could find excuses but i won t no i won t a thousand times no i m a bad lot and must be left at that
p04283_B,04283,B,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us
p04284_B,04284,B,why of course
p04285_B,04285,B,of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time
p04286_B,04286,B,i have something to tell you
p04287_B,04287,B,all right i ll see him
p04288_B,04288,B,she s something else this won t do i can t have her in my garden in this state
p04289_B,04289,B,you put it with your usual delicacy
p04290_B,04290,B,the alexandrina isn t bad
p04291_B,04291,B,a what
p04292_B,04292,B,far too much screaming there
p04293_B,04293,B,yes plenty
p04294_B,04294,B,not a bad business that porphyrion
p04295_B,04295,B,if it isn t a long story
p04296_B,04296,B,i heard of none
p04297_B,04297,B,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen
p04298_B,04298,B,but you can give that up now
p04299_B,04299,B,let em all come
p04300_B,04300,B,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door
p04301_B,04301,B,as i have actually been forgiven
p04302_B,04302,B,don t you want to tidy yourself
p04303_B,04303,B,but i ll say a word to her don t you bother
p04304_B,04304,B,i have not yet decided what about norfolk it is now what nearly october let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring
p04305_B,04305,B,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel
p04306_B,04306,B,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales
p04307_B,04307,B,i may order the motor round mayn t i
p04308_B,04308,B,oh yes she and i have always hit it off together
p04309_B,04309,B,because if he has had enough tea we ought to go dolly s a good little woman but a little of her goes a long way i couldn t live near her if you paid me
p04310_B,04310,B,no my letter s about howards end bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it i am far from sure that i shall give him permission there was no clause in the agreement in my opinion subletting is a mistake if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement morning schlegel don t you think that s better than subletting
p04311_B,04311,B,we are
p04312_B,04312,B,certainly my dear
p04313_B,04313,B,then the fellows know one again especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year s end to year s end
p04314_B,04314,B,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you
p04315_B,04315,B,your sister always likes her little joke
p04316_B,04316,B,come along margaret no wheedling margaret
p04317_B,04317,B,m m m m
p04318_B,04318,B,you too on the move
p04319_B,04319,B,my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special
p04320_B,04320,B,what to do
p04321_B,04321,B,manage what
p04322_B,04322,B,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did
p04323_B,04323,B,did you say that your sister is sleeping here after all
p04324_B,04324,B,why s that gruyere or stilton
p04325_B,04325,B,pray don t apologise
p04326_B,04326,B,margaret margaret no education can teach a woman logic now my dear my time is valuable do you want me to help you or not
p04327_B,04327,B,it s off curzon street
p04328_B,04328,B,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world
p04329_B,04329,B,evie you won t see her she s gone out with cahill it s no fun i can tell you being left so much alone i ve got my work all day indeed a great deal too much of it but when i come home in the evening i tell you i can t stand the house
p04330_B,04330,B,certainly dear girl are you all right now
p04331_B,04331,B,exactly the girl s madly in love with him a very good sort of fellow but he demands and rightly a suitable provision with her and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development
p04332_B,04332,B,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled we only moved a week ago paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small endless drawbacks i forget whether you ve been up to it
p04333_B,04333,B,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say
p04334_B,04334,B,i beg your pardon
p04335_B,04335,B,i have i have been through hell
p04336_B,04336,B,paul oh paul s all right we had a line from madeira he ll be at work again by now
p04337_B,04337,B,better have stilton
p04338_B,04338,B,with pleasure
p04339_B,04339,B,come let s be starting how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane
p04340_B,04340,B,mansbridge perhaps not now

p04369_B,04369,B,i mean reasonable comforts of course i shouldn t like to think that you
p04370_B,04370,B,there you are
p04371_B,04371,B,about greece too

p04379_B,04379,B,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too
p04380_B,04380,B,i don t care you ve made two damaging admissions and i m heartily with you in both
p04381_B,04381,B,your mistake is this and it is a very common mistake this young bounder has a life of his own what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life or as you call it grey
p04382_B,04382,B,there s this other point and then i must go back to my hotel and write some letters what s to be done now about the house in ducie street
p04383_B,04383,B,tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that

p04398_B,04398,B,well hurry up and change
p04399_B,04399,B,not exactly in that case let s be starting

p04409_B,04409,B,why did he leave
p04410_B,04410,B,charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others
p04411_B,04411,B,if he sublets i shan t have the same control in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be things may be done for which no money can compensate for instance i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt it hangs margaret we must go and see the old place some time it s pretty in its way we ll motor down and have lunch with charles
p04412_B,04412,B,my income

p04416_B,04416,B,pigs teeth
p04417_B,04417,B,the fact is my dear i hadn t any intention of bothering you with details i only wanted to let you know that well that something must be done for the others and you ve understood me perfectly so let s pass on to the next point
p04418_B,04418,B,shows things are moving good for trade
p04419_B,04419,B,she really did frighten you poor margaret and very naturally uneducated classes are so stupid
p04420_B,04420,B,what to do
p04421_B,04421,B,but my dear which would you rather have alterations or rheumatism
p04422_B,04422,B,my dear you are forgetting yourself
p04423_B,04423,B,no my dear manslaughter manslaughter charles may go to prison i dare not tell him i don t know what to do what to do i m broken i m ended
p04424_B,04424,B,good bye dolly
p04425_B,04425,B,evie i like that miss schlegel expects me to turn house agent for her
p04426_B,04426,B,with your brother
p04427_B,04427,B,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p04428_B,04428,B,yes yes don t interrupt i ve got it it s perfectly easy leave it to me we ll send her down to howards end
p04429_B,04429,B,your socialists don t
p04430_B,04430,B,much the same as when you honoured it last week
p04431_B,04431,B,right the dining room now the entrance hall here we fellows smoke
p04432_B,04432,B,and have quite forgiven me then listen her cab should already have arrived at howards end we re a little late but no matter our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm as if possible one doesn t want a scene before servants a certain gentleman won t drive in but will wait a little short of the front gate behind the laurels have you still the keys of the house
p04433_B,04433,B,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once
p04434_B,04434,B,don t you indeed i do allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan
p04435_B,04435,B,i wish i had written ought i to have written
p04436_B,04436,B,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down
p04437_B,04437,B,how old
p04438_B,04438,B,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you
p04439_B,04439,B,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name
p04440_B,04440,B,good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth
p04441_B,04441,B,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing
p04442_B,04442,B,miss schlegel i have had you up on false pretences i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house could you be induced to share my is it probable
p04443_B,04443,B,so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it
p04444_B,04444,B,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i
p04445_B,04445,B,here s our hostess good morning mrs munt fine rhododendrons good morning frau liesecke we manage to grow flowers in england don t we
p04446_B,04446,B,i am determined and have already written to charles to that effect
p04447_B,04447,B,if possible yes
p04448_B,04448,B,margaret margaret
p04449_B,04449,B,what have you come up determined not to deal
p04450_B,04450,B,you want to see the house though
p04451_B,04451,B,high tide yes and these are the men to whom we give the vote however they have their own lives and interests let s get on a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone
p04452_B,04452,B,i was thinking if you didn t mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle
p04453_B,04453,B,i hardly consider that a fair deduction
p04454_B,04454,B,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact
p04455_B,04455,B,i must say you re a downright young woman what a question to spring on a fellow
p04456_B,04456,B,as you like
p04457_B,04457,B,i am glad very glad there is so much cant talked in would be intellectual circles i am glad you don t share it self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character but i can t stand those people who run down comforts they have usually some axe to grind can you
p04458_B,04458,B,you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen
p04459_B,04459,B,you re a clever little woman but my motto s concentrate
p04460_B,04460,B,and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary
p04461_B,04461,B,is no one to blame for anything
p04462_B,04462,B,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p04463_B,04463,B,isn t the climate of nigeria too horrible
p04464_B,04464,B,good morning mr wilcox
p04465_B,04465,B,a man who had little money has less owing to us under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression
p04466_B,04466,B,is that your point a man who had little money has less that s mine
p04467_B,04467,B,we have told you about the fellow twice already you have even met the fellow he is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile he is capable of better things we we the upper classes thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge and here s the result
p04468_B,04468,B,human nature i suppose
p04469_B,04469,B,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p04470_B,04470,B,in other words mr bast need never have left it
p04471_B,04471,B,the field s cut the big meadow we ve seen to the very end and it ll be such a crop of hay as never
p04472_B,04472,B,i require no more advice
p04473_B,04473,B,do you remember margaret
p04474_B,04474,B,i didn t say
p04475_B,04475,B,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p04476_B,04476,B,oh come come you re not to blame no one s to blame
p04477_B,04477,B,and how does he clean the boots
p04478_B,04478,B,my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed
p04479_B,04479,B,a word of advice don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor see that she doesn t margaret the poor are poor and one s sorry for them but there it is as civilisation moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary it s just the shoe pinching no one can help it and it might easily have been worse by all means subscribe to charities subscribe to them largely but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social question except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be point me out a time when men have been equal
p04480_B,04480,B,we brought the little fellows round
p04481_B,04481,B,yes extremely
p04482_B,04482,B,she rather reminds me of dolly
p04483_B,04483,B,what what s that do you mean that i m responsible
p04484_B,04484,B,some one s got to go england will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices unless we get firm in west africa ger untold complications may follow now tell me all your news
p04485_B,04485,B,i wouldn t say that but you re taking it far too seriously who is this fellow
p04486_B,04486,B,now a word of advice
p04487_B,04487,B,i am really concerned at the way those girls go on they are as clever as you make em but unpractical god bless me one of these days they ll go too far girls like that oughtn t to live alone in london until they marry they ought to have some one to look after them we must look in more often we re better than no one you like them don t you evie
p04488_B,04488,B,no the fellow needn t
p04489_B,04489,B,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p04490_B,04490,B,what s his profession
p04491_B,04491,B,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p04492_B,04492,B,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p04493_B,04493,B,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier no no you can t there always have been rich and poor i m no fatalist heaven forbid but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces and there always will be rich and poor you can t deny it and you can t deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward
p04494_B,04494,B,not at all i don t agree with your sister there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster it would have helped me no end
p04495_B,04495,B,i am grieved for your clerk but it is all in the day s work it s part of the battle of life
p04496_B,04496,B,yes indeed
p04497_B,04497,B,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls
p04498_B,04498,B,what s that father
p04499_B,04499,B,i bred em myself
p04500_B,04500,B,yes indeed father

p04508_B,04508,B,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p04509_B,04509,B,there you hear that most unfair the gentleman says there not content with you can t deny it but as soon as i m useful it s a very different thing oh yes send for him cross question him pick his brains oh yes now take me on the whole i m a quiet fellow i m law abiding i don t wish any unpleasantness but i i

p04514_B,04514,B,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p04515_B,04515,B,oh i dare say
p04516_B,04516,B,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p04517_B,04517,B,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p04518_B,04518,B,you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly you must keep that type at a distance otherwise they forget themselves sad but true they aren t our sort and one must face the fact
p04519_B,04519,B,and you dolly
p04520_B,04520,B,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that

p04536_B,04536,B,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p04537_B,04537,B,i should think it would trust mr wilcox for doing himself proud all those ducie street houses are beautiful in their modern way and i can t think why he doesn t keep on with it but it s really for evie that he went there and now that evie s going to be married
p04538_B,04538,B,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that

p04551_B,04551,B,of course i ve hurt myself
p04552_B,04552,B,you should have thought of that sooner charles
p04553_B,04553,B,what s mr bryce like
p04554_B,04554,B,stopping s no good
p04555_B,04555,B,you ll see it at its worst for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him i never saw such a disgraceful mess it s unbelievable he wasn t in the house a month
p04556_B,04556,B,your hand s bleeding
p04557_B,04557,B,you ve hurt yourself
p04558_B,04558,B,i m in for a frightful row from the pater
p04559_B,04559,B,yes but no woman
p04560_B,04560,B,invalid type couldn t sleep
p04561_B,04561,B,may i ask what
p04562_B,04562,B,i m afraid i cannot what are the facts we are all mad more or less you know in these days
p04563_B,04563,B,it didn t hurt him
p04564_B,04564,B,i can t have this sort of behaviour my boy margaret s too sweet natured to mind but i mind for her is anything wrong with you charles this afternoon
p04565_B,04565,B,i think i ll go round to the police station
p04566_B,04566,B,i think i ll walk
p04567_B,04567,B,but the real cause was heart disease of that you re sure
p04568_B,04568,B,right my dear boy i don t know but you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t then did he just just crumple up as you said
p04569_B,04569,B,perhaps perhaps
p04570_B,04570,B,tell me when she comes in
p04571_B,04571,B,what what man
p04572_B,04572,B,who s we my boy pray who s we
p04573_B,04573,B,why charles
p04574_B,04574,B,it is indeed my boy
p04575_B,04575,B,my god is it possible in your mother s house charles in your mother s house
p04576_B,04576,B,sword what sword whose sword
p04577_B,04577,B,not to night my boy i can t sleep i had better have a talk with you and get it over she will feel differently in the morning but i cannot let this kind of thing continue without comment i am morally certain that she is with her sister at howards end the house is mine and charles it will be yours and when i say that no one is to live there i mean that no one is to live there i won t have it to my mind this question is connected with something far greater the rights of property itself
p04578_B,04578,B,what were you doing with it
p04579_B,04579,B,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce
p04580_B,04580,B,i ve sent a telegram after him and a pretty sharp one too he and he in person is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years
p04581_B,04581,B,eight or earlier say that you are acting as my representative and of course use no violence charles
p04582_B,04582,B,then what
p04583_B,04583,B,she was bound to drive there will be her books
p04584_B,04584,B,you go on as if i didn t know my own mind you young fellows one idea is to get into a motor i tell you i want to walk i m very fond of walking
p04585_B,04585,B,quite right
p04586_B,04586,B,nothing else
p04587_B,04587,B,the whole house is at sixes and sevens we don t want any more mess
p04588_B,04588,B,that or a fit however we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics
p04589_B,04589,B,it s a good half mile the sun s very hot for april shan t i take you up and then perhaps a little spin round by tewin
p04590_B,04590,B,he pulled over the bookcase as i said and fell
p04591_B,04591,B,i promised to tell you with her love that she was going to germany with her sister this evening that was all we had time for because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding for suddenly mrs wilcox screamed out his name i recognised it and i went for him in the hall was i right pater i thought things were going a little too far
p04592_B,04592,B,i ll sit up for her as late as you like but she can hardly be coming isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel
p04593_B,04593,B,no pater but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon
p04594_B,04594,B,it has been pretty horrible they were there and they had the man up there with them too
p04595_B,04595,B,pater we may as well keep howards end out of it
p04596_B,04596,B,it is all very well the pater s saying that he will be just to all but one can t be just indefinitely money isn t elastic what s to happen if evie has a family and come to that so may the pater there ll not be enough to go round for there s none coming in either through dolly or percy it s damnable
p04597_B,04597,B,i expected that i shall naturally be the most important witness there
p04598_B,04598,B,i told you last night his name was bast
p04599_B,04599,B,he caught hold of the bookcase which came down over him so i merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden we all thought he was shamming however he s dead right enough awful business
p04600_B,04600,B,can i do anything for you sir
p04601_B,04601,B,a sword of theirs
p04602_B,04602,B,yes i flung them down
p04603_B,04603,B,the keys are at the farm we wouldn t have the keys
p04604_B,04604,B,then at eight to morrow i may go up in the car
p04605_B,04605,B,well didn t you see pater i had to snatch up the first thing handy i hadn t a riding whip or stick i caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old german sword
p04606_B,04606,B,i am sure i beg your pardon i appear always to be intruding
p04607_B,04607,B,oh all right i m about the house if you want me for anything i thought of not going up to the office to day if that is your wish
p04608_B,04608,B,dolly would have taken them but i was in fortunately
p04609_B,04609,B,i know pater that was what i felt as a matter of fact there is no need to trouble about the man he was in the last stages of heart disease and just before i could show him what i thought of him he went off the police are seeing about it at this moment i got up there oh it couldn t have been more than half past seven the avery woman was lighting a fire for them they were still upstairs i waited in the drawing room we were all moderately civil and collected though i had my suspicions i gave them your message and mrs wilcox said in that way of hers
p04610_B,04610,B,i dare say we didn t explain it has been a mistake and very likely our mistake
p04611_B,04611,B,i don t know i dare say well thank you very much miss avery yes that s all right delightful
p04612_B,04612,B,yes mrs wilcox s house the mother of mr charles
p04613_B,04613,B,we are not coming no not coming never coming it has all been a mistake the furniture must be repacked at once and i am very sorry but i am making other arrangements and must ask you to give me the keys
p04614_B,04614,B,i m afraid this isn t what we meant mr wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched for instance these books are my brother s we are storing them for him and for my sister who is abroad when you kindly undertook to look after things we never expected you to do so much
p04615_B,04615,B,had they no men to help them
p04616_B,04616,B,it is all a mistake a misunderstanding mr wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end
p04617_B,04617,B,no doubt mr wilcox may have induced death but if it wasn t one thing it would have been another as you know
p04618_B,04618,B,they breed and they also work it certainly is a funny world but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it i think it ll never be a bad one never really bad
p04619_B,04619,B,they keep england going it is my opinion
p04620_B,04620,B,it s a beautiful meadow
p04621_B,04621,B,i mrs wilcox i
p04622_B,04622,B,i hope miss avery is not ill
p04623_B,04623,B,whom should she have married
p04624_B,04624,B,we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in sussex and part of this furniture my part will go down there presently
p04625_B,04625,B,am i
p04626_B,04626,B,that remains to be seen we have no intention of doing so for the present we happen to need a much larger house circumstances oblige us to give big parties of course some day one never knows does one
p04627_B,04627,B,until mr wilcox came along
p04628_B,04628,B,well i don t know i really don t know what s to be done
p04629_B,04629,B,oh good night miss avery
p04630_B,04630,B,thank you so much
p04631_B,04631,B,my brother gets hay fever too
p04632_B,04632,B,the house has been empty long enough
p04633_B,04633,B,yes it should be a merry house enough
p04634_B,04634,B,mrs wilcox it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years the house is mrs wilcox s and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer
p04635_B,04635,B,i suppose so but ruth should have married a no disrespect to you to say this for i take it you were intended to get wilcox any way whether she got him first or no
p04636_B,04636,B,come right into the hall first
p04637_B,04637,B,no better n nothing i never saw much of ruth after her grandmother died but we stayed civil it was a very civil family old mrs howard never spoke against anybody nor let any one be turned away without food then it was never trespassers will be prosecuted in their land but would people please not come in mrs howard was never created to run a farm
p04638_B,04638,B,there is still the parlour and the dining room then through here i ve not finished here yet there s still a deal to do the farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs for there is no need to go into expense at hilton
p04639_B,04639,B,certainly mrs wilcox
p04640_B,04640,B,ay they breed like rabbits well well it s a funny world but he who made it knows what he wants in it i suppose if mrs charlie is expecting her fourth it isn t for us to repine
p04641_B,04641,B,this house lies too much on the land for them naturally they were glad enough to slip in at first but wilcoxes are better than nothing as i see you ve found they keep a place going don t they yes it is just that
p04642_B,04642,B,you are living here and have been for the last ten minutes if you ask me the nursery
p04643_B,04643,B,in fancy of course in fancy you had her way of walking good day
p04644_B,04644,B,madge go away this is no moment for your hat
p04645_B,04645,B,things went on until there were no men
p04646_B,04646,B,oh indeed on account of his hay fever
p04647_B,04647,B,some day tcha tcha don t talk about some day you are living here now
p04648_B,04648,B,you think that you won t come back to live here mrs wilcox but you will
p04649_B,04649,B,mistake upon mistake mistake upon mistake
p04650_B,04650,B,a soldier some real soldier but that s all over a better time is coming now though you ve kept me long enough waiting in a couple of weeks i ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening have you ordered in coals
p04651_B,04651,B,yes mrs wilcox of course
p04652_B,04652,B,yes the maidy s well enough for those that is who don t suffer from sneezing i ve seen charlie wilcox go out to my lads in hay time oh they ought to do this they mustn t do that he d learn them to be lads and just then the tickling took him he has it from his father with other things there s not one wilcox that can stand up against a field in june i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth
p04653_B,04653,B,what makes it smell so funny
p04654_B,04654,B,it was a perfectly awful letter charles said it was the letter of a madman in the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck pond
p04655_B,04655,B,we think she meant to be invited to oniton and so climb into society
p04656_B,04656,B,but the present was so expensive
p04657_B,04657,B,hasn t she though what used to be the hall s full of them charles thought for certain you knew of it
p04658_B,04658,B,is she never coming back to england every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t
p04659_B,04659,B,well ask me another margaret oh what was i going to say how s helen
p04660_B,04660,B,just when baby was born then
p04661_B,04661,B,charles has never seen the plans
p04662_B,04662,B,are those the plans does it matter my seeing them
p04663_B,04663,B,but she s only a farm woman
p04664_B,04664,B,oh yes that is it miss avery has been unpacking your packing cases
p04665_B,04665,B,i say she s dotty she was the one that never got married you know oh i say perhaps she thinks your books are wedding presents to herself old maids are taken that way sometimes miss avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust up with evie
p04666_B,04666,B,but hasn t she any address
p04667_B,04667,B,it was far more than an air the floor sounds covered with books charles sent me to know what is to be done for he feels certain you don t know
p04668_B,04668,B,oh mine was old earthenware stuff not worth a halfpenny evie s was quite different you d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it was quite impossible and when four men agree what is a girl to do evie didn t want to upset the old thing so thought a sort of joking letter best and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble
p04669_B,04669,B,did you take her for a spook
p04670_B,04670,B,or miss avery giving me a wedding present but charles said i must try not to mind because she had known his grandmother
p04671_B,04671,B,no don t bother that s eight months she has been away surely
p04672_B,04672,B,still when it costs over five pounds i didn t see it but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop you can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman now can you
p04673_B,04673,B,didn t you know she gave evie a present last august and evie returned it and then oh goloshes you never read such a letter as miss avery wrote
p04674_B,04674,B,and which way up is it
p04675_B,04675,B,that s a notion give every one their due eh well i suppose i ought to be toddling come along mr muff you want a new coat but i don t know who ll give it you i m sure oh yes
p04676_B,04676,B,but lucky you with four courts of your own at midhurst
p04677_B,04677,B,ask another i suppose you ordered her to
p04678_B,04678,B,i suppose the paper
p04679_B,04679,B,but miss avery said
p04680_B,04680,B,did she give any reasons
p04681_B,04681,B,why does that make any difference dolly
p04682_B,04682,B,i am very much obliged to you dolly what can have come over miss avery i must go down about it at once some of the books are my brother s and are quite valuable she had no right to open any of the cases
p04683_B,04683,B,so it is helen is odd awfully she has now been away eight months
p04684_B,04684,B,quite well
p04685_B,04685,B,just so
p04686_B,04686,B,they have only just arrived here is the ground floor no that s rather difficult try the elevation we are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky line
p04687_B,04687,B,of course not
p04688_B,04688,B,i wonder then why he let me ask her to look after the house
p04689_B,04689,B,why has she done that how unnecessary
p04690_B,04690,B,i hadn t heard of that
p04691_B,04691,B,a poste restante somewhere in bavaria is her address do write her a line i will look it up for you
p04692_B,04692,B,books dolly are you serious has she been touching our books
p04693_B,04693,B,you accepted a present from miss avery when you were married
p04694_B,04694,B,not exactly
p04695_B,04695,B,why dolly here s a surprise how are the boys and the baby
p04696_B,04696,B,exactly she left just after evie s wedding it would be eight months
p04697_B,04697,B,but it was wrong of evie to return it it wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing
p04698_B,04698,B,just the ordinary way up that s the sky line and the part that smells strongest is the sky
p04699_B,04699,B,she s rather old for that may she not have given the present to evie in remembrance of her mother
p04700_B,04700,B,it will be very jolly
p04701_B,04701,B,i gave no such orders perhaps she was airing the things she did undertake to light an occasional fire
p04702_B,04702,B,i believe so
p04703_B,04703,B,you re not fit for it let me go alone i know exactly what to do
p04704_B,04704,B,say anything you like all right
p04705_B,04705,B,as usual you ve got the story wrong my good dorothea
p04706_B,04706,B,i wish you d ask whether crane s ended
p04707_B,04707,B,that s not what i was saying
p04708_B,04708,B,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely and let everyone understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise in consequence i leave my wife no money that is her own wish all that she would have had will be divided among you i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me that is her wish too she also is giving away a great deal of money she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew down in the field is all that clear does everyone understand
p04709_B,04709,B,i say howards end howards ended i m rather on the spot this evening eh
p04710_B,04710,B,yes mr wilcox i see
p04711_B,04711,B,what for
p04712_B,04712,B,i meant great grandmother the one who left mrs wilcox the house weren t both of them and miss avery friends when howards end too was a farm then hadn t mrs wilcox a brother or was it an uncle anyhow he popped the question and miss avery she said no just imagine if she d said yes she would have been charles s aunt oh i say that s rather good charlie s aunt i must chaff him about that this evening and the man went out and was killed yes i m certain i ve got it right now tom howard he was the last of them
p04713_B,04713,B,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p04714_B,04714,B,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p04715_B,04715,B,got room in your car for a little un i cut as soon as i saw it wasn t a dog the chauffeurs are tackling the girl miss schlegel pon my word you ve hurt your hand

p04747_B,04747,B,we were saying henry and i were just having the fiercest argument my point being
p04748_B,04748,B,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p04749_B,04749,B,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p04750_B,04750,B,oh yes mrs wilcox quite sure she is here daily
p04751_B,04751,B,have you got the key auntie
p04752_B,04752,B,auntie it s mrs wilcox

p04758_B,04758,B,margaret s point is this our sister may be mad
p04759_B,04759,B,all the same you have not quite seen our point
p04760_B,04760,B,she has never behaved like this before then
p04761_B,04761,B,i don t suppose i ever shall
p04762_B,04762,B,in what sense
p04763_B,04763,B,no one i don t think so
p04764_B,04764,B,in my rooms she mentioned some friends called the basts
p04765_B,04765,B,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p04766_B,04766,B,i mind very much
p04767_B,04767,B,people friends of hers at evie s wedding
p04768_B,04768,B,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish

p04814_B,04814,B,very well does my arrangement suit you evie
p04815_B,04815,B,good bye my boy always take care of yourself
p04816_B,04816,B,don t paul you promised you d take care
p04817_B,04817,B,and i understood that signor carella was a member of the italian nobility
p04818_B,04818,B,remember that it is only by going off the track that you get to know the country see the little towns gubbio pienza cortona san gemignano monteriano and don t let me beg you go with that awful tourist idea that italy s only a museum of antiquities and art love and understand the italians for the people are more marvellous than the land
p04819_B,04819,B,thank you for the information i know everything as i told you before i am also aware of the social position of an italian who pulls teeth in a minute provincial town
p04820_B,04820,B,poor lilia i know it may be painful but i have come to rescue you and book worm though i may be i am not frightened to stand up to a bully he s merely an insolent boy he thinks he can keep you to your word by threats he will be different when he sees he has a man to deal with
p04821_B,04821,B,because we expected her to so i am confident and you in your heart agree that this engagement will not last think of your life at home think of irma and i ll also say think of us for you know lilia that we count you more than a relation i should feel i was losing my own sister if you did this and my mother would lose a daughter
p04822_B,04822,B,the whole thing is like a bad dream so bad that it cannot go on if there was one redeeming feature about the man i might be uneasy as it is i can trust to time for the moment lilia he has taken you in but you will find him out soon it is not possible that you a lady accustomed to ladies and gentlemen will tolerate a man whose position is well not equal to the son of the servants dentist in coronation place i am not blaming you now but i blame the glamour of italy i have felt it myself you know and i greatly blame miss abbott
p04823_B,04823,B,yes and i forbid you to do it you despise me perhaps and think i m feeble but you re mistaken you are ungrateful and impertinent and contemptible but i will save you in order to save irma and our name there is going to be such a row in this town that you and he ll be sorry you came to it i shall shrink from nothing for my blood is up it is unwise of you to laugh i forbid you to marry carella and i shall tell him so now
p04824_B,04824,B,that he is probably a ruffian and certainly a cad
p04825_B,04825,B,i wish i were
p04826_B,04826,B,what kind of lawyer
p04827_B,04827,B,please sit down signor carella mrs herriton is rather agitated but there is no reason we should not be calm might i offer you a cigarette please sit down signor carella i will be frank with you i have come to prevent you marrying mrs herriton because i see you will both be unhappy together she is english you are italian she is accustomed to one thing you to another and pardon me if i say it she is rich and you are poor
p04828_B,04828,B,i should like to see you now please in my room as i have come all the way on business
p04829_B,04829,B,indeed philip you surprise me i understood you went in for equality and so on
p04830_B,04830,B,how i wish you were coming philip
p04831_B,04831,B,caroline why blame her what s all this to do with caroline
p04832_B,04832,B,well we put it like that in the telegram so as not to shock dear mrs herriton but it is true he is a younger branch of course families ramify just as in yours there is your cousin joseph gino s father is courtesy itself and rising rapidly in his profession this very month he leaves monteriano and sets up at poggibonsi and for my own poor part i think what people are is what matters but i don t suppose you ll agree and i should like you to know that gino s uncle is a priest the same as a clergyman at home well his cousin s a lawyer at rome
p04833_B,04833,B,i can t break it off now
p04834_B,04834,B,there are no cads in italy he is the son of a dentist why not
p04835_B,04835,B,good bye dear every one what a whirl good bye darling mind you re always good and do what granny tells you
p04836_B,04836,B,why a lawyer just like you are except that he has lots to do and can never get away
p04837_B,04837,B,for once in my life i ll thank you to leave me alone i ll thank your mother too for twelve years you ve trained me and tortured me and i ll stand it no more do you think i m a fool do you think i never felt ah when i came to your house a poor young bride how you all looked me over never a kind word and discussed me and thought i might just do and your mother corrected me and your sister snubbed me and you said funny things about me to show how clever you were and when charles died i was still to run in strings for the honour of your beastly family and i was to be cooped up at sawston and learn to keep house and all my chances spoilt of marrying again no thank you no thank you bully insolent boy who s that pray but you but thank goodness i can stand up against the world now for i ve found gino and this time i marry for love
p04838_B,04838,B,see for yourself
p04839_B,04839,B,i ll do my best
p04840_B,04840,B,she is sure to be good
p04841_B,04841,B,grandmother dear not granny and we say a boat or a steamer not a ship ships have sails and mother won t go all the way by sea you look at the map of europe and you ll see why harriet take her go with aunt harriet and she ll show you the map
p04842_B,04842,B,really irma is getting too tiresome she forgot poor lilia soon enough
p04843_B,04843,B,caroline my caroline jump in or your chaperon will go off without you
p04844_B,04844,B,handkerchiefs and collars in my inlaid box i ve lent you my inlaid box
p04845_B,04845,B,good old harry
p04846_B,04846,B,oh i am so sorry but you do look so funny oh you all look so funny waving oh pray
p04847_B,04847,B,high spirits to begin so long a journey
p04848_B,04848,B,i wish that mrs charles had gotten the footwarmer these london porters won t take heed to a country chap
p04849_B,04849,B,but you did your best and i think it simply noble of you to have brought mrs theobald all the way here on such a day as this
p04850_B,04850,B,aunt harriet uncle phil grandmamma what do you suppose my little brother is doing now has he begun to play do italian babies talk sooner than us or would he be an english baby born abroad oh i do long to see him and be the first to teach him the ten commandments and the catechism
p04851_B,04851,B,and granny when will the old ship get to italy
p04852_B,04852,B,we will save the peas to the last they are the greatest fun
p04853_B,04853,B,mrs theobald must be told but she doesn t count she is breaking up very quickly she doesn t even see mr kingcroft now he thank goodness i hear has at last consoled himself with someone else
p04854_B,04854,B,that is quite possible he knows that irma will worry us about the baby perhaps he hopes that we shall adopt it to quiet her
p04855_B,04855,B,stop that nonsense philip i will not be disgraced by her i will have the child pay all we ve got for it i will have it
p04856_B,04856,B,yes dear but now it is really a new life because we are all at accord then you were still infatuated with italy it may be full of beautiful pictures and churches but we cannot judge a country by anything but its men
p04857_B,04857,B,on irma why
p04858_B,04858,B,she asked if she could pray for her new father for the italian
p04859_B,04859,B,so one would have supposed but she never cared for her mother and little girls of nine don t reason clearly she looks on it as a long visit and it is important most important that she should not receive a shock all a child s life depends on the ideal it has of its parents destroy that and everything goes morals behaviour everything absolute trust in some one else is the essence of education that is why i have been so careful about talking of poor lilia before her
p04860_B,04860,B,she would go anywhere i and caroline abbott had the greatest difficulty in dissuading her from the riviera
p04861_B,04861,B,mr kingcroft made her i am certain of it he wanted to see lilia again and this was the only way
p04862_B,04862,B,it is something that she is contented but no one could live three months with caroline abbott and not be the better for it
p04863_B,04863,B,i got up without saying anything
p04864_B,04864,B,the later the better every moment she is developing
p04865_B,04865,B,what had you to fence about read the letters we have failed
p04866_B,04866,B,if you don t go she will
p04867_B,04867,B,we can but trust to our influence
p04868_B,04868,B,poor lilia was almost a daughter to me once i know what miss abbott means but now things have altered any initiative would naturally come from mrs theobald
p04869_B,04869,B,caroline has been extremely impertinent yet there may be something in what she says after all ought the child to grow up in that place and with that father let us admit frankly that after all we may have responsibilities
p04870_B,04870,B,i stopped that she is bringing him in everywhere it is most vexatious the other night she asked if she might include him in the people she mentions specially in her prayers
p04871_B,04871,B,now dears don t listen to lilia s letter we love this place and i do not know how i shall ever thank philip for telling me it it is not only so quaint but one sees the italians unspoiled in all their simplicity and charm here the frescoes are wonderful caroline who grows sweeter every day is very busy sketching
p04872_B,04872,B,she did but she has a mind of extraordinary delicacy she saw that i was reticent and she did not press me you see philip i can say to you what i could not say before harriet her ideas are so crude really we do not want it known in sawston that there is a baby all peace and comfort would be lost if people came inquiring after it
p04873_B,04873,B,harriet harriet shall go too harriet now will be invaluable
p04874_B,04874,B,when a man is neither well bred nor well connected nor handsome nor clever nor rich even lilia may discard him in time
p04875_B,04875,B,no it is not that for some perverse reason he will not part with the child i must go and tell poor caroline she will be equally distressed the impudence the cursed impudence oh i m swearing i don t care that beastly woman how dare she interfere i ll philip dear i m sorry it s no good you must go
p04876_B,04876,B,at the same time he has the chance of corrupting the child s morals he entreats her to send the baby one
p04877_B,04877,B,most certainly this is the proper course and why ever should we tell caroline
p04878_B,04878,B,poor child how vulgar it s surprising that she isn t worse but she has got a look of poor charles about her
p04879_B,04879,B,my dear boy if possible she has got worse and worse it was your idea of italian travel that saved us
p04880_B,04880,B,no dear very little poor charles provided for every kind of contingency in his will the money will come to you and harriet as irma s guardians
p04881_B,04881,B,she won t accept won t accept the letter as final you must go to monteriano
p04882_B,04882,B,don t dear and harriet don t be so serious i mean not so serious when you are with irma she will be worse than ever if she thinks we have something to hide
p04883_B,04883,B,he will get all hers but you know what that is
p04884_B,04884,B,dear you re shockingly cynical how would the sum work out
p04885_B,04885,B,but what effect will the letter have on him
p04886_B,04886,B,of course but i think we can still not tell her about lilia s marriage
p04887_B,04887,B,up to i am wondering whether i ought not to adopt the child is that sufficiently plain
p04888_B,04888,B,it is i repeat she has been extremely impertinent none the less she is showing me my duty if i can rescue poor lilia s baby from that horrible man who will bring it up either as papist or infidel who will certainly bring it up to be vicious i shall do it
p04889_B,04889,B,of course i allowed her she has a right to mention any one she chooses but i was annoyed with her this morning and i fear that i showed it
p04890_B,04890,B,as for caroline i was almost frightened she broke down utterly she cried even when she left the house i comforted her as best i could and i kissed her it is something that the breach between her and ourselves is now entirely healed
p04891_B,04891,B,poor silly creature the less she hears about it the better she will be pleased i have come to be very sorry for caroline she if any one has suffered and been penitent she burst into tears when i told her a little only a little of that terrible letter i never saw such genuine remorse we must forgive her and forget let the dead bury their dead we will not trouble her with them
p04892_B,04892,B,isn t it disheartening
p04893_B,04893,B,and why not say if you choose that i talk like irma that child has seen the thing more clearly than any of us she longs for her little brother she shall have him i don t care if i am impulsive
p04894_B,04894,B,i told her not to but we must watch her carefully without of course appearing to be suspicious
p04895_B,04895,B,i mind nothing so long as she has gone and gone with miss abbott it is mortifying to think that a widow of thirty three requires a girl ten years younger to look after her
p04896_B,04896,B,she might do it too
p04897_B,04897,B,on us perhaps we have morals and behaviour also and i don t think this continual secrecy improves them
p04898_B,04898,B,i must say it seems rather hard luck doesn t it
p04899_B,04899,B,i didn t know i was still such an ass why can t i realize that it s merely tricks of expression a bounder s a bounder whether he lives in sawston or monteriano
p04900_B,04900,B,the child must know some time
p04901_B,04901,B,no mother no she was really keen on italy this travel is quite a crisis for her
p04902_B,04902,B,i hope he is satisfied i did not think my sister in law distinguished herself in her farewells
p04903_B,04903,B,they ve stopped there over a week why i shouldn t have done as much myself they must be really keen for the hotel s none too comfortable
p04904_B,04904,B,then let her go let her mess with italy by herself she ll come to grief somehow italy s too dangerous too
p04905_B,04905,B,hopeful indeed
p04906_B,04906,B,i won t i ve been and i ve failed i ll never see the place again i hate italy
p04907_B,04907,B,a living brother is more to her than a dead mother she can knit him socks
p04908_B,04908,B,did you let her
p04909_B,04909,B,it will make a difference in the money surely
p04910_B,04910,B,i don t think that and she must have suspected something by now
p04911_B,04911,B,what did you say
p04912_B,04912,B,that is quite true
p04913_B,04913,B,i will do all i can
p04914_B,04914,B,let her go to italy let her meddle with what she doesn t understand look at this letter the man who wrote it will marry her or murder her or do for her somehow he s a bounder but he s not an english bounder he s mysterious and terrible he s got a country behind him that s upset people from the beginning of the world
p04915_B,04915,B,no i believe she would take any one right up to the last when her boxes were packed she was playing the chinless curate both the curates are chinless but hers had the dampest hands i came on them in the park they were speaking of the pentateuch
p04916_B,04916,B,go where do sit down what s happened
p04917_B,04917,B,you must have felt just as you did when i wanted to pray for the devil
p04918_B,04918,B,she was so mixed up in the affair
p04919_B,04919,B,i don t understand you mother you are turning absolutely round what are you up to
p04920_B,04920,B,the odd part is that she was quite eager always asking me for information and of course i was very glad to give it i admit she is a philistine appallingly ignorant and her taste in art is false still to have any taste at all is something and i do believe that italy really purifies and ennobles all who visit her she is the school as well as the playground of the world it is really to lilia s credit that she wants to go there
p04921_B,04921,B,and this is the result of half a dozen idiocies of miss abbott
p04922_B,04922,B,the sum works out against us or perhaps he is putting up the price
p04923_B,04923,B,do you suppose that he guesses the situation how anxious we are to hush the scandal up
p04924_B,04924,B,good so those are our tactics to tell no one about the baby not even miss abbott
p04925_B,04925,B,you talk like harriet
p04926_B,04926,B,good does the italian get anything
p04927_B,04927,B,and alas alas a look of old mrs theobald what appalling apparition was that i did think the lady was bedridden as well as imbecile why ever did she come
p04928_B,04928,B,but you forget this wretched baby waters and adamson write that there is a baby
p04929_B,04929,B,certainly he will never suppose that
p04930_B,04930,B,when he gets it he will do a sum if it is less expensive in the long run to part with a little money and to be clear of the baby he will part with it if he would lose he will adopt the tone of the loving father
p04931_B,04931,B,and what happened this morning
p04932_B,04932,B,did she ask no questions as to the nature of lilia s death i mean
p04933_B,04933,B,here beginneth the new life then do you remember mother that was what we said when we saw lilia off
p04934_B,04934,B,i don t know i m sure but if you wanted to ensure the baby being posted by return you should have sent a little sum to him oh i m not cynical at least i only go by what i know of him but i am weary of the whole show weary of italy weary weary weary sawston s a kind pitiful place isn t it i will go walk in it and seek comfort
p04935_B,04935,B,who s to watch her at school though she may bubble out any moment
p04936_B,04936,B,i pity miss abbott fortunately one admirer is chained to england mr kingcroft cannot leave the crops or the climate or something i don t think either he improved his chances today he as well as lilia has the knack of being absurd in public
p04937_B,04937,B,swear if you like blaspheme abuse me but understand i m in earnest
p04938_B,04938,B,i do
p04939_B,04939,B,i shouldn t think you could it doesn t seem the best moment to begin your italy mania i thought you were cured of it by now instead will you kindly tell me what you are going to do when you arrive i do beg you will not be taken unawares this time
p04940_B,04940,B,theatres here and at such a moment
p04941_B,04941,B,yes i m sure she needs it anything more unchristian
p04942_B,04942,B,oh he understands he tried to carry the baby
p04943_B,04943,B,he has murdered her the things he did things one can t even mention
p04944_B,04944,B,i don t understand your long words say plainly
p04945_B,04945,B,are you
p04946_B,04946,B,nothing at all it s frightful
p04947_B,04947,B,i shan t
p04948_B,04948,B,if you like but you will not come up till you have seen the italian
p04949_B,04949,B,of course you ve started him again i m certain he was asleep i do wish you wouldn t talk it makes me so nervous
p04950_B,04950,B,to the italian go
p04951_B,04951,B,but do people live inside
p04952_B,04952,B,i cannot understand people what can they be doing all day and there is no church there i suppose
p04953_B,04953,B,yes indeed mother has written me a really beautiful letter she describes how it was that she gradually got to feel that we must rescue the poor baby from its terrible surroundings how she has tried by letter and it is no good nothing but insincere compliments and hypocrisy came back then she says there is nothing like personal influence you and philip will succeed where i have failed she says too that caroline abbott has been wonderful caroline feels it as keenly almost as us that is because she knows the man oh he must be loathsome goodness me i ve forgotten to pack the ammonia it has been a terrible lesson for caroline but i fancy it is her turning point i can t help liking to think that out of all this evil good will come

p04989_B,04989,B,certainly one has so few opportunities of hearing music it is sure to be very bad but it might be better than sitting idle all the evening we have no book and i lost my crochet at florence
p04990_B,04990,B,what about the baby pray you ve said a lot of smart things and whittled away morality and religion and i don t know what but what about the baby you think me a fool but i ve been noticing you all today and you haven t mentioned the baby once you haven t thought about it even you don t care philip i shall not speak to you you are intolerable go
p04991_B,04991,B,oh not all i wanted she went away before i had finished speaking just like those cowardly people into the church
p04992_B,04992,B,it s the supreme test the man who is unchivalrous to a woman
p04993_B,04993,B,he her if you don t look out he ll murder you i wish he would
p04994_B,04994,B,well she isn t

p04999_B,04999,B,poor gino he s no greater than i am after all
p05000_B,05000,B,you will have a lot to tell miss abbott harriet and she may have as much to tell you so i ll pay my call on signor carella as you suggested and see how things stand tear each other s eyes out give it to her harriet teach her to leave us alone give it to her caroline teach her to be grateful to you go it ladies go it
p05001_B,05001,B,keep still let no one move we may tread on it keep still
p05002_B,05002,B,all puckered queerly
p05003_B,05003,B,things aren t so jolly easy
p05004_B,05004,B,i ve not got the baby harriet but at the same time i haven t exactly failed i and signor carella are to have another interview this afternoon at the caffe garibaldi he is perfectly reasonable and pleasant should you be disposed to come with me you would find him quite willing to discuss things he is desperately in want of money and has no prospect of getting any i discovered that at the same time he has a certain affection for the child miss abbott has behaved extraordinarily but at the same time harriet you must listen my dear you must stop crying i have something quite important to say
p05005_B,05005,B,when she s swept back she ll be invaluable for she has made quite an impression on him he thinks her so nice with the baby you know she washed it for him
p05006_B,05006,B,when she got there there was some pretty domestic scene between him and the baby and she has got swept off in a gush of sentimentalism before very long if i know anything about psychology there will be a reaction she ll be swept back
p05007_B,05007,B,harriet don t act or act better
p05008_B,05008,B,i know it is but it s old awfully old
p05009_B,05009,B,go where
p05010_B,05010,B,harriet i am hot to whom do you refer
p05011_B,05011,B,you mustn t accuse her of that though she is exasperating she hasn t come here to betray us
p05012_B,05012,B,but why not gino or perfetta
p05013_B,05013,B,there is a caffe a prison a theatre a church walls a view
p05014_B,05014,B,la signorina si sente male c e il sole
p05015_B,05015,B,remember that miss abbott has done us no harm she said nothing to him about the matter he assumes that she is working with us i gathered that
p05016_B,05016,B,i m damned if i ll go i want my tea
p05017_B,05017,B,oh thanks
p05018_B,05018,B,there is santa deodata one of the most beautiful churches in italy
p05019_B,05019,B,my dear sister i can reassure you firstly the beastly baby is italian secondly it was promptly christened at santa deodata s and a powerful combination of saints watch over
p05020_B,05020,B,then what have you come for pray for ornament
p05021_B,05021,B,i suppose he breathes and all that sort of thing
p05022_B,05022,B,singles or returns
p05023_B,05023,B,mother told you did she
p05024_B,05024,B,harriet are you mad
p05025_B,05025,B,but this is an opera lucia di lammermoor sir walter scott classical you know
p05026_B,05026,B,well hold him up again
p05027_B,05027,B,oh stow it take it to the back kitchen it s no more a supreme test than anything else the italians never were chivalrous from the first if you condemn him for that you ll condemn the whole lot
p05028_B,05028,B,if she goes to a service at santa deodata s she will find more beauty and sincerity than there is in all the back kitchens of europe
p05029_B,05029,B,did mother explain it all to you
p05030_B,05030,B,i m nervous too i wish he d scream it s too uncanny poor gino i m terribly sorry for gino
p05031_B,05031,B,because he s weak like most of us he doesn t know what he wants he doesn t grip on to life but i like that man and i m sorry for him you despise him harriet and you despise me but you do us no good by it we fools want some one to set us on our feet suppose a really decent woman had set up gino i believe caroline abbott might have done it mightn t he have been another man
p05032_B,05032,B,absurd nonsense they talk about the heat supposing we were here for pleasure what could be more pleasurable than this
p05033_B,05033,B,no he s crying hard i thought so before and i m certain now
p05034_B,05034,B,why it is the famous hot lady of the apennines the one who had never never before
p05035_B,05035,B,things which one must mention if one s to talk at all and things which one must keep in their proper place because he was unfaithful to his wife it doesn t follow that in every way he s absolutely vile
p05036_B,05036,B,are you all right
p05037_B,05037,B,of course we must tell irma
p05038_B,05038,B,no harriet he is too vulgar
p05039_B,05039,B,oh i m perfectly right but at the same time i don t know so many things have happened here people have lived so hard and so splendidly i can t explain
p05040_B,05040,B,what s that
p05041_B,05041,B,good miss abbott you are coming too
p05042_B,05042,B,nobody asked you miss you see now lilia was asked by such a nice young gentleman with curls all over his forehead and teeth just as white as father makes them but harriet do you see nothing wonderful or attractive in that place nothing at all
p05043_B,05043,B,i say you haven t hurt it or held it the wrong way or anything it is too uncanny crying and no noise why didn t you get perfetta to carry it to the hotel instead of muddling with the messenger it s a marvel he understood about the note
p05044_B,05044,B,buona sera signora padrona si ritorna volontieri a monteriano vorrei due camere
p05045_B,05045,B,oh certainly harriet i shall make a point of reminding him
p05046_B,05046,B,into santa deodata s
p05047_B,05047,B,his face do you know struck me as all wrong
p05048_B,05048,B,sweet creature how helpful you will be when we come to signor carella
p05049_B,05049,B,please is there an english lady here
p05050_B,05050,B,well i suppose i shall and i shall also have my interview with signor carella but why should you mind do you suppose that i shall have the slightest influence over him
p05051_B,05051,B,my dear sister you can t run on like that you don t buy a pair of gloves in two hours much less a baby
p05052_B,05052,B,i dare say it will be all right but as i told you i thought the man i met on the rocca a strange difficult man
p05053_B,05053,B,and the french as well
p05054_B,05054,B,yes but if you re careful she may be i interpret her behaviour thus she went to see him honestly intending to get the child away in the note she left me she says so and i don t believe she d lie
p05055_B,05055,B,tut tut tutlet you d find a corpse extraordinarily inconvenient i heartily dislike the fellow but we know he didn t murder her in that letter though she said a lot she never said he was physically cruel
p05056_B,05056,B,first harriet i shall settle you at the stella d italia in the comfort that befits your sex and disposition then i shall make myself some tea after tea i shall take a book into santa deodata s and read there it is always fresh and cool
p05057_B,05057,B,whose is it whose is it whose is it
p05058_B,05058,B,no harriet i ll try for the baby but for nothing else i promise to do that tomorrow and to do it in the way you wish but tonight as we re all tired we want a change of topic we want relaxation we want to go to the theatre
p05059_B,05059,B,think of mother and don t straddle across the stairs let the cabman and the landlady come down and let me go up and choose rooms
p05060_B,05060,B,oh harriet is a bad lot
p05061_B,05061,B,did you
p05062_B,05062,B,god help me
p05063_B,05063,B,but it must be sillier than usual look here read it mother i can t make head or tail
p05064_B,05064,B,every one to his taste
p05065_B,05065,B,i don t understand it doesn t make sense
p05066_B,05066,B,your feet grow larger every day
p05067_B,05067,B,oh what is to be done
p05068_B,05068,B,oh what is to be done what is to be done
p05069_B,05069,B,but what a place to go to what nice person too do you meet in a hotel
p05070_B,05070,B,actually old mrs theobald
p05071_B,05071,B,it s a shame mother philip laughs at everything the book club the debating society the progressive whist the bazaars people won t like it we have our reputation a house divided against itself cannot stand
p05072_B,05072,B,the meaning
p05073_B,05073,B,after all she has suffered that letter kept me awake for nights the whole thing is like one of those horrible modern plays where no one is in the right but if we have mourning it will mean telling irma
p05074_B,05074,B,let s finish the peas there won t be any letters
p05075_B,05075,B,let philip say what he likes and he will let us do what we like it s twelve the second post s in run and see if there are any letters
p05076_B,05076,B,what is the difficulty what is it that puzzles you in this letter
p05077_B,05077,B,the meaning is quite clear lilia is engaged to be married don t cry dear please me by not crying don t talk at all it s more than i could bear she is going to marry some one she has met in a hotel take the letter and read for yourself how dare she not tell me direct how dare she write first to yorkshire pray am i to hear through mrs theobald a patronizing insolent letter like this have i no claim at all bear witness dear bear witness that for this i ll never forgive her
p05078_B,05078,B,if there is an office there we might get an answer this evening since philip is back at seven and the eight fifteen catches the midnight boat at dover harriet when you go with this get 100 pounds in 5 pound notes at the bank go dear at once do not talk i see irma coming back go quickly well irma dear and whose team are you in this afternoon miss edith s or miss may s
p05079_B,05079,B,it is too bad it s ridiculous to read dear she s not trying to marry any one in the place some tourist obviously who s stopping in the hotel the place has nothing to do with it at all
p05080_B,05080,B,nice or nasty as i have told you several times before is not the point lilia has insulted our family and she shall suffer for it and when you speak against hotels i think you forget that i met your father at chamounix you can contribute nothing dear at present and i think you had better hold your tongue i am going to the kitchen to speak about the range
p05081_B,05081,B,her letters never did
p05082_B,05082,B,no dear please go i ll sow the peas but you shall cover them up and mind the birds don t see em
p05083_B,05083,B,this first next a telegram for lilia no a telegram for miss caroline abbott she too has something to explain
p05084_B,05084,B,of course there isn t let s keep to the main issue this baby s quite beside the point mrs theobald will do nothing and it s no concern of ours
p05085_B,05085,B,read me the letter my hands are dirty how intolerable the crested paper is
p05086_B,05086,B,a native of the place
p05087_B,05087,B,he has no heart he does not really mind about the child at all
p05088_B,05088,B,you may be right when i tried to pave the way so to speak to hint that he had not behaved as he ought well it was no good at all he couldn t or wouldn t understand
p05089_B,05089,B,we can write at all events
p05090_B,05090,B,an explanation may bore you mr herriton it drags in other topics
p05091_B,05091,B,it is tempting it is tempting not to be mysterious i ve wanted often to tell you and then been afraid i could never tell any one else certainly no woman and i think you re the one man who might understand and not be disgusted
p05092_B,05092,B,and he never mentioned the baby once
p05093_B,05093,B,it is very kind of you mr herriton in some ways i should enjoy it but excuse the suggestion i don t think we ought to go to cheap seats
p05094_B,05094,B,he said he would never be happy again
p05095_B,05095,B,we were mad drunk with rebellion we had no common sense as soon as you came you saw and foresaw everything
p05096_B,05096,B,so i went up in the evening for the sunset i had nothing to do he was in the garden it belongs to a friend of his
p05097_B,05097,B,one would never believe it he looks much older
p05098_B,05098,B,it was a mistake of mrs theobald s
p05099_B,05099,B,certainly please if you will be so very kind
p05100_B,05100,B,and now like most young men he is looking out for something to do
p05101_B,05101,B,spy spy your mother has behaved dishonourably all through she never wanted the child no harm in that but she is too proud to let it come to me she has done all she could to wreck things she did not tell you everything she has told harriet nothing at all she has lied or acted lies everywhere i cannot trust your mother so i have come here alone all across europe no one knows it my father thinks i am in normandy to spy on mrs herriton don t let s argue if you are here to get the child i will help you if you are here to fail i shall get it instead of you
p05102_B,05102,B,of course why not
p05103_B,05103,B,i will indeed
p05104_B,05104,B,oh yes he has he will never give it up
p05105_B,05105,B,what isn t fine here i wish i was harriet
p05106_B,05106,B,surely that isn t an opera bill
p05107_B,05107,B,but what s that to do with it
p05108_B,05108,B,good bye it s been a great pleasure to see you i hope that won t shift at all events
p05109_B,05109,B,poor harriet as if i dare judge harriet or anybody
p05110_B,05110,B,petty unselfishness i had got an idea that every one here spent their lives in making little sacrifices for objects they didn t care for to please people they didn t love that they never learnt to be sincere and what s as bad never learnt how to enjoy themselves that s what i thought what i thought at monteriano
p05111_B,05111,B,i hated sawston you see
p05112_B,05112,B,that i love him
p05113_B,05113,B,i want to finish next morning i found signor carella and said the same to him he well he was willing that s all
p05114_B,05114,B,very good looking all his features are good and he is well built though i dare say english standards would find him too short
p05115_B,05115,B,it will never be settled
p05116_B,05116,B,ah the telegram that was wrong lilia there was more cowardly than i was we should have told the truth it lost me my nerve at all events i came to the station meaning to tell you everything then but we had started with a lie and i got frightened and at the end when you left i got frightened again and came with you
p05117_B,05117,B,but that s why i can talk about it and tell you everything i have always wanted to you thought me stupid and sentimental and wicked and mad but you never really knew how much i was to blame
p05118_B,05118,B,i have never had that experience yet surely i and my life must be where i live
p05119_B,05119,B,i don t go by what i saw of him but by what i know of him
p05120_B,05120,B,yes i was wrong that is so
p05121_B,05121,B,i can do no more but i tell you plainly i have changed sides
p05122_B,05122,B,nothing except the times we have seen each other
p05123_B,05123,B,i know you did lilia saw him several times again and i knew i ought to interfere i called her to my bedroom one night she was very frightened for she knew what it was about and how severe i could be do you love this man i asked yes or no she said yes and i said why don t you marry him if you think you ll be happy
p05124_B,05124,B,harriet may be right i am afraid
p05125_B,05125,B,that s not doing anything you would be doing something if you kidnapped the baby or if you went straight away but that to fail honourably to come out of the thing as well as you can is that all you are after
p05126_B,05126,B,you do understand wonderfully you are the only one of us who has a general view of the muddle so what are you going to do
p05127_B,05127,B,why aren t you angry with me
p05128_B,05128,B,you ve upset me i thought i was past all this you re taking it wrongly i m in love with gino don t pass it off i mean it crudely you know what i mean so laugh at me
p05129_B,05129,B,i should be grateful you see harriet knows nothing
p05130_B,05130,B,oh no not that i never told him that you and harriet were coming you could have taken him by surprise if you liked he only asked for you and wished he hadn t been so rude to you eighteen months ago
p05131_B,05131,B,if i saw him often i might remember what he is like or he might grow old but i dare not risk it so nothing can alter me now
p05132_B,05132,B,because i understand the place there is no need
p05133_B,05133,B,i suppose so there is general conscription he was in the bersaglieri i think isn t that the crack regiment
p05134_B,05134,B,the first evening we got to monteriano lilia went out for a walk alone saw that italian in a picturesque position on a wall and fell in love he was shabbily dressed and she did not even know he was the son of a dentist i must tell you i was used to this sort of thing once or twice before i had had to send people about their business
p05135_B,05135,B,what of
p05136_B,05136,B,it depends
p05137_B,05137,B,what do you mean please please mr herriton don t be mysterious there isn t the time any moment harriet may be down and we shan t have decided how to behave to her sawston was different we had to keep up appearances but here we must speak out and i think i can trust you to do it otherwise we ll never start clear
p05138_B,05138,B,a short time quite a short time
p05139_B,05139,B,i wish something would happen to you my dear friend i wish something would happen to you
p05140_B,05140,B,no position at all he is kicking his heels as my father would say you see he has only just finished his military service
p05141_B,05141,B,thank him please when you write and give him my kindest regards
p05142_B,05142,B,oh you shall know quick enough
p05143_B,05143,B,his father well i don t suppose you ll think it a good match but that s not the point i mean the point is not i mean that social differences love after all not but what i gentlemen sometimes judge hardly but i feel that you and at all events your mother so really good in every sense so really unworldly after all love marriages are made in heaven
p05144_B,05144,B,but is there an opera right up here
p05145_B,05145,B,stop i ll tell you no more
p05146_B,05146,B,it would have suited them lilia needed me and as for him i can t help feeling i might have got influence over him
p05147_B,05147,B,it was very awkward for me but i had to talk he seemed to make me you see he thought i was here as a tourist he thinks so still he intended to be civil and i judged it better to be civil also
p05148_B,05148,B,my interview how do you know of it
p05149_B,05149,B,oh no please not at all i am here my own idea to give all information which you very naturally and to see if somehow please ask anything you like
p05150_B,05150,B,have you told mrs herriton
p05151_B,05151,B,i hated the idleness the stupidity the respectability the petty unselfishness
p05152_B,05152,B,none at all fight as if you think us wrong oh what s the use of your fair mindedness if you never decide for yourself any one gets hold of you and makes you do what they want and you see through them and laugh at them and do it it s not enough to see clearly i m muddle headed and stupid and not worth a quarter of you but i have tried to do what seemed right at the time and you your brain and your insight are splendid but when you see what s right you re too idle to do it you told me once that we shall be judged by our intentions not by our accomplishments i thought it a grand remark but we must intend to accomplish not sit intending on a chair
p05153_B,05153,B,mr herriton don t please mr herriton a dentist his father s a dentist
p05154_B,05154,B,i can t stop here i daren t stop here you will have to take me with you
p05155_B,05155,B,had you ever let her choose i m afraid that s rude
p05156_B,05156,B,as far as i have seen him i do as far as i have seen him i do like him
p05157_B,05157,B,he said he was sorry pleasantly as italians do say such things but he never mentioned the baby once
p05158_B,05158,B,of course we shall meet whenever you come down and i hope that it will mean often
p05159_B,05159,B,can t we go
p05160_B,05160,B,this time the same place the same thing help me
p05161_B,05161,B,close on three weeks
p05162_B,05162,B,i have also seen examples of that in my district
p05163_B,05163,B,it will come to nothing well
p05164_B,05164,B,i hope you see why i have troubled you with this long story women i heard you say the other day are never at ease till they tell their faults out loud lilia is dead and her husband gone to the bad all through me you see mr herriton it makes me specially unhappy it s the only time i ve ever gone into what my father calls real life and look what i ve made of it all that winter i seemed to be waking up to beauty and splendour and i don t know what and when the spring came i wanted to fight against the things i hated mediocrity and dulness and spitefulness and society i actually hated society for a day or two at monteriano i didn t see that all these things are invincible and that if we go against them they will break us to pieces thank you for listening to so much nonsense
p05165_B,05165,B,well i have explained
p05166_B,05166,B,the weather there will be rain he says by tomorrow evening the other towns england myself about you a little and he actually mentioned lilia he was perfectly disgusting he pretended he loved her he offered to show me her grave the grave of the woman he has murdered
p05167_B,05167,B,oh quite young twenty one i believe
p05168_B,05168,B,mr herriton how could you believe her do you suppose that i would have entered that man s house knowing about him all that i do i think you have very odd ideas of what is possible for a lady i hear you wanted harriet to go very properly she refused eighteen months ago i might have done such a thing but i trust i have learnt how to behave by now
p05169_B,05169,B,mr herriton come here look at this
p05170_B,05170,B,all the wonderful things are over that is just where it is
p05171_B,05171,B,when will you see him again
p05172_B,05172,B,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round
p05173_B,05173,B,that he is a thoroughly wicked man
p05174_B,05174,B,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever
p05175_B,05175,B,exactly eleven days
p05176_B,05176,B,most awfully
p05177_B,05177,B,i know what he has done what he says and what he thinks is of very little importance
p05178_B,05178,B,not an interview an accident i am very sorry i meant you to have the chance of seeing him first though it is your fault you are a day late you were due here yesterday so i came yesterday and not finding you went up to the rocca you know that kitchen garden where they let you in and there is a ladder up to a broken tower where you can stand and see all the other towers below you and the plain and all the other hills
p05179_B,05179,B,i suppose you didn t settle anything
p05180_B,05180,B,oh you appreciate me i wish you didn t you appreciate us all see good in all of us and all the time you are dead dead dead look why aren t you angry you are so splendid mr herriton that i can t bear to see you wasted i can t bear she has not been good to you your mother
p05181_B,05181,B,the child came into the world through my negligence it is natural i should take an interest in it
p05182_B,05182,B,i don t but i do expect you to settle what is right and to follow that do you want the child to stop with his father who loves him and will bring him up badly or do you want him to come to sawston where no one loves him but where he will be brought up well there is the question put dispassionately enough even for you settle it settle which side you ll fight on but don t go talking about an honourable failure which means simply not thinking and not acting at all
p05183_B,05183,B,don t talk of faults you re my friend for ever mr herriton i think only don t be charitable and shift or take the blame get over supposing i m refined that s what puzzles you get over that i say again don t be charitable if he had asked me i might have given myself body and soul that would have been the end of my rescue party but all through he took me for a superior being a goddess i who was worshipping every inch of him and every word he spoke and that saved me
p05184_B,05184,B,for a time at all events
p05185_B,05185,B,the wonderful things are over
p05186_B,05186,B,who ever is perfetta
p05187_B,05187,B,now lilia though there were things about her i didn t like had somehow kept the power of enjoying herself with sincerity and gino i thought was splendid and young and strong not only in body and sincere as the day if they wanted to marry why shouldn t they do so why shouldn t she break with the deadening life where she had got into a groove and would go on in it getting more and more worse than unhappy apathetic till she died of course i was wrong she only changed one groove for another a worse groove and as for him well you know more about him than i do i can never trust myself to judge characters again but i still feel he cannot have been quite bad when we first met him lilia that i should dare to say it must have been cowardly he was only a boy just going to turn into something fine i thought and she must have mismanaged him so that is the one time i have gone against what is proper and there are the results you have an explanation now
p05188_B,05188,B,oh certainly i don t want to speak to him again i shan t ever see him again
p05189_B,05189,B,in where
p05190_B,05190,B,she will soon be her old self
p05191_B,05191,B,sawston and work
p05192_B,05192,B,i suppose i do
p05193_B,05193,B,you did not think it a little thing at the time you told me he had assaulted you
p05194_B,05194,B,yes i m terribly lonely or i wouldn t speak i think you must know already
p05195_B,05195,B,no but i can t repeat all that i said in the church you ought never to see him again you ought to bundle harriet into a carriage not this evening but now and drive her straight away
p05196_B,05196,B,i ll tell you not another word
p05197_B,05197,B,i know that
p05198_B,05198,B,but it s so different of course i shall go to sawston you forget my father and even if he wasn t there i ve a hundred ties my district i m neglecting it shamefully my evening classes the st james
p05199_B,05199,B,i think never
p05200_B,05200,B,yes i know but pretty things pack as easily as ugly ones we had no need to come to italy like guys
p05201_B,05201,B,yes pull it to pieces tell me i m a fool or worse that he s a cad say all you said when lilia fell in love with him that s the help i want i dare tell you this because i like you and because you re without passion you look on life as a spectacle you don t enter it you only find it funny or beautiful so i can trust you to cure me mr herriton isn t it funny he s not a gentleman nor a christian nor good in any way he s never flattered me nor honoured me but because he s handsome that s been enough the son of an italian dentist with a pretty face oh mr herriton isn t it funny i love him and i m not ashamed of it i love him and i m going to sawston and if i mayn t speak about him to you sometimes i shall die
p05202_B,05202,B,i understood they met at the hotel
p05203_B,05203,B,no you re wrong he does he is unhappy like the rest of us but he doesn t try to keep up appearances as we do he knows that the things that have made him happy once will probably make him happy again
p05204_B,05204,B,lucia di lammermoor by the master donizetti unique representation this evening
p05205_B,05205,B,in his passion not when he was calm we english say it when we are calm when we do not really believe it any longer gino is not ashamed of inconsistency it is one of the many things i like him for
p05206_B,05206,B,no more do i he was out
p05207_B,05207,B,so did and do i that s splendid go on
p05208_B,05208,B,petty selfishness
p05209_B,05209,B,but i say it s not enough you can t go back to the old life if you wanted to too much has happened
p05210_B,05210,B,that you and he i was going to say whatever have you got in common
p05211_B,05211,B,oh i quite sympathize with what you say it isn t nonsense and a year or two ago i should have been saying it too but i feel differently now and i hope that you also will change society is invincible to a certain degree but your real life is your own and nothing can touch it there is no power on earth that can prevent your criticizing and despising mediocrity nothing that can stop you retreating into splendour and beauty into the thoughts and beliefs that make the real life the real you
p05212_B,05212,B,really miss abbott it is a little late for reticence you have equipped me admirably
p05213_B,05213,B,the view from the rocca small gratuity is finest at sunset
p05214_B,05214,B,would that have suited a newly married pair
p05215_B,05215,B,and is he good looking
p05216_B,05216,B,i also understand that he is a member of the italian nobility may i be told his name
p05217_B,05217,B,then how long has she been engaged
p05218_B,05218,B,one more question and only one more what is his father
p05219_B,05219,B,and please believe that i have not come to scold you i know what has happened
p05220_B,05220,B,i should like to hear though what he said about me is he preparing a warm reception
p05221_B,05221,B,the view from the rocca wasn t it fine
p05222_B,05222,B,is harriet going to be all right
p05223_B,05223,B,if you do no more that is all we want you promise not to prejudice our cause by speaking to signor carella
p05224_B,05224,B,and much of it has been most interesting though i don t understand everything did you never think of the disparity of their social position
p05225_B,05225,B,and you talked
p05226_B,05226,B,it s hard luck on her she is a good person i must do for her anything i can
p05227_B,05227,B,laugh at love
p05228_B,05228,B,my dear miss abbott he is not a murderer i have just been driving that into harriet and when you know the italians as well as i do you will realize that in all that he said to you he was perfectly sincere the italians are essentially dramatic they look on death and love as spectacles i don t doubt that he persuaded himself for the moment that he had behaved admirably both as husband and widower
p05229_B,05229,B,the child is no relation of ours it is therefore scarcely for us to interfere
p05230_B,05230,B,well you are right this affair is being managed by the ladies
p05231_B,05231,B,yes we counted on you
p05232_B,05232,B,you are wonderful
p05233_B,05233,B,but we re here to rescue a child
p05234_B,05234,B,did you really mean to stop
p05235_B,05235,B,may i conclude that you like him
p05236_B,05236,B,i shall never forgive him
p05237_B,05237,B,why yes since we talk openly that is all i am after just now what else is there if i can persuade signor carella to give in so much the better if he won t i must report the failure to my mother and then go home why miss abbott you can t expect me to follow you through all these turns
p05238_B,05238,B,from what you saw of him should you conclude that he would make an affectionate parent
p05239_B,05239,B,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious
p05240_B,05240,B,but before you retire to sawston are you so mighty sure
p05241_B,05241,B,miss abbott don t worry over me some people are born not to do things i m one of them i never did anything at school or at the bar i came out to stop lilia s marriage and it was too late i came out intending to get the baby and i shall return an honourable failure i never expect anything to happen now and so i am never disappointed you would be surprised to know what my great events are going to the theatre yesterday talking to you now i don t suppose i shall ever meet anything greater i seem fated to pass through the world without colliding with it or moving it and i m sure i can t tell you whether the fate s good or evil i don t die i don t fall in love and if other people die or fall in love they always do it when i m just not there you are quite right life to me is just a spectacle which thank god and thank italy and thank you is now more beautiful and heartening than it has ever been before
p05242_B,05242,B,which which times
p05243_B,05243,B,rather i love him too when i can forget how he hurt me that evening though whenever we shake hands
p05244_B,05244,B,let us rather say unhappily expressed
p05245_B,05245,B,as a private
p05246_B,05246,B,it is hopeless to expect you to believe me but i can assert that we are here to get the child even if it costs us all we ve got my mother has fixed no money limit whatever i am here to carry out her instructions i think that you will approve of them as you have practically dictated them i do not approve of them they are absurd harriet also carries out your instructions she however approves of them and does not know that they proceed from you i think miss abbott you had better take entire charge of the rescue party i have asked for an interview with signor carella tomorrow morning do you acquiesce might i ask for details of your interview with him they might be helpful to me
p05247_B,05247,B,yes i can t live at sawston
p05248_B,05248,B,not only pain and sorrow but wonderful things that tower in the sunlight do you remember it and all you said to me the theatre even and the next day in the church and our times with gino
p05249_B,05249,B,why no how could i the fact is well i got taken by surprise but after all what does it matter there s no earthly reason why we shouldn t do the business pleasantly he s a perfectly charming person and so are his friends i m his friend now his long lost brother what s the harm i tell you miss abbott it s one thing for england and another for italy there we plan and get on high moral horses here we find what asses we are for things go off quite easily all by themselves my hat what a night did you ever see a really purple sky and really silver stars before well as i was saying it s absurd to worry he s not a porky father he wants that baby as little as i do he s been ragging my dear mother just as he ragged me eighteen months ago and i ve forgiven him oh but he has a sense of humour
p05250_B,05250,B,she fences well
p05251_B,05251,B,pray let us start clear permit me to begin by asking you a question in which capacity have you come to monteriano spy or traitor
p05252_B,05252,B,it reaches up to heaven and down to the other place is it to be a symbol of the town
p05253_B,05253,B,well if the fancy does pass let me know
p05254_B,05254,B,at present it is still unsettled
p05255_B,05255,B,the men in it must be short and broad they must also be able to walk six miles an hour
p05256_B,05256,B,are you lonely is it anything like that
p05257_B,05257,B,really really you knew lilia all your life apart from everything else as if she could choose what could make her happy
p05258_B,05258,B,yes yes i know the rocca i told you of it
p05259_B,05259,B,silly nonsense you re too good about a thousand times better than i am you can t live in that hole you must go among people who can hope to understand you i mind for myself i want to see you often again and again
p05260_B,05260,B,i wrote from monteriano i tried to explain things but she will never understand me her view will be that the affair is settled sadly settled since the baby is dead still it s over our family circle need be vexed no more she won t even be angry with you you see you have done us no harm in the long run unless of course you talk about harriet and make a scandal so that is my plan london and work what is yours
p05261_B,05261,B,is the young person mad never in my life have i seen such colossal impertinence she ought to be well smacked and sent back to sunday school but don t you see she is practically threatening us you can t put her off with mrs theobald she knows as well as we do that she is a nonentity if we don t do anything she s going to raise a scandal that we neglect our relatives c which is of course a lie still she ll say it oh dear sweet sober caroline abbott has a screw loose we knew it at monteriano i had my suspicions last year one day in the train and here it is again the young person is mad shall i go round at once and give it her well i d really enjoy it
p05262_B,05262,B,do this afternoon i have another interview
p05263_B,05263,B,he was out you find me as ignorant as you have left harriet
p05264_B,05264,B,i should like to know how long if you can remember
p05265_B,05265,B,perhaps i do perhaps i could speak instead but if you will say the word plainly you ll never be sorry i will thank you for it all my life
p05266_B,05266,B,harriet would say he has no sense of sin
p05267_B,05267,B,yes miss abbott i know but i am anxious to hear heaven s choice you arouse my curiosity is my sister in law to marry an angel
p05268_B,05268,B,then how old is he
p05269_B,05269,B,but pardon me miss abbott of most of your conduct you have given a description rather than an explanation
p05270_B,05270,B,why of course you would be going two carriages then two carriages for the evening train harriet whatever are you up to we shall never be ready
p05271_B,05271,B,why miss abbott you should have told me this before think it still i agree with lots of it magnificent
p05272_B,05272,B,help help
p05273_B,05273,B,i cannot think what is in the air if lilia was determined to disgrace us she might have found a less repulsive way a boy of medium height with a pretty face the son of a dentist at monteriano have i put it correctly may i surmise that he has not got one penny may i also surmise that his social position is nil furthermore
p05274_B,05274,B,indeed i never think about it now
p05275_B,05275,B,and the telegram
p05276_B,05276,B,what is he please you haven t told me that what s his position
p05277_B,05277,B,i lost my temper did he really what exactly did he say
p05278_B,05278,B,you ve seen too much you ve seen as much and done more than i have
p05279_B,05279,B,quite nice wasn t he
p05280_B,05280,B,why yes these people know how to live they would sooner have a thing bad than not have it at all that is why they have got to have so much that is good however bad the performance is tonight it will be alive italians don t love music silently like the beastly germans the audience takes its share sometimes more
p05281_B,05281,B,yes rather
p05282_B,05282,B,did you know him before you came
p05283_B,05283,B,yet thoroughly wicked men have loved their children look at rodrigo borgia for example
p05284_B,05284,B,because i understand you all sides i think harriet signor carella even my mother
p05285_B,05285,B,there is another great consolation against invincible mediocrity the meeting a fellow victim i hope that this is only the first of many discussions that we shall have together
p05286_B,05286,B,oh never mind
p05287_B,05287,B,and of what did you talk
p05288_B,05288,B,good lord
p05289_B,05289,B,into signor carella s house
p05290_B,05290,B,because harriet
p05291_B,05291,B,thank you thank you for everything
p05292_B,05292,B,i hope next spring perhaps we shall paint siena red for a day or two with some of the new wife s money it was one of the arguments for marrying her
p05293_B,05293,B,but through my fault he is parted from the child he loves and because my life was in danger you came and saw him and spoke to him again
p05294_B,05294,B,well what do you conclude from that
p05295_B,05295,B,you going
p05296_B,05296,B,how long have you been here
p05297_B,05297,B,oh that ll be all right we ll go as we are and buy the best we can get monteriano is not formal we do all right
p05298_B,05298,B,if so perhaps he isn t sinful
p05299_B,05299,B,i suppose i misunderstood perfetta where did you have your interview then
p05300_B,05300,B,don t you like it at all
p05301_B,05301,B,because i understand the position of signor carella and of you it s no reason that
p05302_B,05302,B,it s not enough it ll only be in the old horrible way each with a dozen relatives round us no miss abbott it s not good enough
p05303_B,05303,B,it is extraordinarily good of you to take this unexpected interest
p05304_B,05304,B,then another if that fails i shall wire home for instructions i dare say we may fail altogether but we shall fail honourably
p05305_B,05305,B,perhaps it is what the books call a passing fancy
p05306_B,05306,B,i am ignorant of these matters but i should have thought that would have increased the difficulty of the situation
p05307_B,05307,B,miss abbott what is the matter with you i thought i understood you and i don t all those two great first days at monteriano i read you as clearly as you read me still i saw why you had come and why you changed sides and afterwards i saw your wonderful courage and pity and now you re frank with me one moment as you used to be and the next moment you shut me up you see i owe too much to you my life and i don t know what besides i won t stand it you ve gone too far to turn mysterious i ll quote what you said to me don t be mysterious there isn t the time i ll quote something else i and my life must be where i live you can t live at sawston
p05308_B,05308,B,from perfetta if it interests you
p05309_B,05309,B,oh i don t think that
p05310_B,05310,B,perhaps not well as i said i know what has happened and i am not here to scold you but i must ask you to withdraw from the thing for the present harriet is furious but she will calm down when she realizes that you have done us no harm and will do none
p05311_B,05311,B,the woman who must have let you in
p05312_B,05312,B,he s much more honest with himself than i am and he is honest without an effort and without pride but you miss abbott what about you will you be in italy next spring
p05313_B,05313,B,for whatever reason
p05314_B,05314,B,perhaps i ought but it isn t a very big ought whatever harriet and i do the issue is the same why i can see the splendour of it even the humour gino sitting up here on the mountain top with his cub we come and ask for it he welcomes us we ask for it again he is equally pleasant i m agreeable to spend the whole week bargaining with him but i know that at the end of it i shall descend empty handed to the plains it might be finer of me to make up my mind but i m not a fine character and nothing hangs on it
p05315_B,05315,B,what a memory the fellow has for little things
p05316_B,05316,B,you will write
p05317_B,05317,B,but why prove to me why i don t do as i am
p05318_B,05318,B,never mind it s all over now let the dead bury their dead it s fallen out of our lives
p05319_B,05319,B,i m clear enough about harriet s future and about parts of my own but i ask again what about yours
p05320_B,05320,B,understand italy
p05321_B,05321,B,indeed i will
p05322_B,05322,B,don t you think it s better than sitting in all the evening and getting nervous
p05323_B,05323,B,i don t believe it at all events not for me the most wonderful things may be to come
p05324_B,05324,B,but may not the fish die they have no air

p05427_B,05427,B,i think you are quite right i shall not bring people to the house any more i do not see why an english wife should be treated differently this is italy
p05428_B,05428,B,one i have seen who may be so she spoke very little but she was a young lady different to most she too was english the companion of my wife here but fra filippo the brother in law took her back with him i saw them start he was very angry i regret though that i toppled him on to the bed a great tall man and when i am really amused i am often impolite
p05429_B,05429,B,it sometimes happens that such things are recollected longest i shall never see him again of course but it is no benefit to me that he should wish me ill and even if he has forgotten i am still sorry that i toppled him on to the bed i want to consult you since you are so kind as to take an interest in my affairs my wife wishes to take solitary walks but i have forbidden her
p05430_B,05430,B,thirty three
p05431_B,05431,B,it pleases me very much if you remember i always desired a blonde
p05432_B,05432,B,she is rich she is generous she is affable she addresses her inferiors without haughtiness
p05433_B,05433,B,certainly not you are in my country
p05434_B,05434,B,most excellent advice and i thank you for it but she wishes to give tea parties men and women together whom she has never seen
p05435_B,05435,B,no compliments i beg
p05436_B,05436,B,what am i to do about it
p05437_B,05437,B,is she simpatica
p05438_B,05438,B,you will never see him again and by now the scene will have passed from his mind
p05439_B,05439,B,you are very wise very wise indeed the more precious a possession the more carefully it should be guarded
p05440_B,05440,B,that is true here you are wiser than i sono poco simpatiche le donne and the time we waste over them is much
p05441_B,05441,B,it is a most important thing
p05442_B,05442,B,i do not accept small sums now it is not worth the risk but the german was another matter but listen my gino for i am older than you and more full of experience the person who understands us at first sight who never irritates us who never bores to whom we can pour forth every thought and wish not only in speech but in silence that is what i mean by simpatico
p05443_B,05443,B,blonde or dark
p05444_B,05444,B,i see i see she needs employment is she a catholic
p05445_B,05445,B,of course not still you might take her at first that is what my brother has done with his wife at bologna and he has joined the free thinkers he took her once or twice himself and now she has acquired the habit and continues to go without him
p05446_B,05446,B,ah well we cannot have everything
p05447_B,05447,B,we all desire one but you gino deserve your good fortune for you are a good son a brave man and a true friend and from the very first moment i saw you i wished you well
p05448_B,05448,B,it is not sufficient one does not define it thus last month a german was smuggling cigars the custom house was dark yet i refused because i did not like him the gifts of such men do not bring happiness non era simpatico he paid for every one and the fine for deception besides
p05449_B,05449,B,if i do come and take tea with you this bill must be my affair
p05450_B,05450,B,oh the english they are always thinking of tea they carry it by the kilogramme in their trunks and they are so clumsy that they always pack it at the top but it is absurd
p05451_B,05451,B,is it not true does not he deserve this wealthy blonde
p05452_B,05452,B,of course i was only joking
p05453_B,05453,B,do nothing or ask me
p05454_B,05454,B,he does deserve her
p05455_B,05455,B,tell me i forgot to ask is she young

p05462_B,05462,B,then is nothing to be done for the child at all
p05463_B,05463,B,of course if mrs theobald decides on any plan that seems at all practicable i must say i don t see any such i shall ask if i may join her in it for irma s sake and share in any possible expenses please would you let me know if she decides on anything i should like to join as well
p05464_B,05464,B,yes i have i came to ask you have any steps been taken
