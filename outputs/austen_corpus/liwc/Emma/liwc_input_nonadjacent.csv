p00000_A,00000,A,they are to be put into mr weston s stable papa you know we have settled all that already we talked it all over with mr weston last night and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you
p00001_A,00001,A,ah poor miss taylor tis a sad business
p00002_A,00002,A,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two
p00003_A,00003,A,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00004_A,00004,A,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00005_A,00005,A,well you want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day
p00006_A,00006,A,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00007_A,00007,A,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00008_A,00008,A,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00009_A,00009,A,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that
p00010_A,00010,A,a straightforward open hearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference
p00011_A,00011,A,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00012_A,00012,A,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00013_A,00013,A,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you
p00014_A,00014,A,oh dear no never
p00015_A,00015,A,by all means we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party
p00016_A,00016,A,miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted the expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes it is the fault of her face that she has them not
p00017_A,00017,A,you have made her too tall emma
p00018_A,00018,A,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed
p00019_A,00019,A,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00020_A,00020,A,but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear
p00021_A,00021,A,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness
p00022_A,00022,A,i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey
p00023_A,00023,A,thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you
p00024_A,00024,A,i do not offer it for miss smith s collection being my friend s i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it
p00025_A,00025,A,take it it is for you take your own
p00026_A,00026,A,oh no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it do as you please
p00027_A,00027,A,ah papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here i am sure she will be pleased with the children we are very proud of the children are not we papa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john
p00028_A,00028,A,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00029_A,00029,A,well i cannot understand it
p00030_A,00030,A,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life
p00031_A,00031,A,oh dear yes
p00032_A,00032,A,oh yes sir how you must miss her and dear emma too what a dreadful loss to you both i have been so grieved for you i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her it is a sad change indeed but i hope she is pretty well sir
p00033_A,00033,A,pretty well my dear i hope pretty well i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably
p00034_A,00034,A,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00035_A,00035,A,very much to the honour of both
p00036_A,00036,A,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00037_A,00037,A,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00038_A,00038,A,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00039_A,00039,A,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00040_A,00040,A,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00041_A,00041,A,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00042_A,00042,A,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00043_A,00043,A,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not
p00044_A,00044,A,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes
p00045_A,00045,A,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly
p00046_A,00046,A,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00047_A,00047,A,ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me
p00048_A,00048,A,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing
p00049_A,00049,A,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once
p00050_A,00050,A,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00051_A,00051,A,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august
p00052_A,00052,A,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to
p00053_A,00053,A,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00054_A,00054,A,middling my dear i cannot compliment you i think mr john knightley very far from looking well
p00055_A,00055,A,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00056_A,00056,A,my dear isabella pray do not concern yourself about my looks be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse
p00057_A,00057,A,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00058_A,00058,A,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty
p00059_A,00059,A,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure
p00060_A,00060,A,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion
p00061_A,00061,A,very cold certainly very cold
p00062_A,00062,A,you do quite right we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston
p00063_A,00063,A,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day
p00064_A,00064,A,indeed i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment
p00065_A,00065,A,my son frank my son
p00066_A,00066,A,yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper
p00067_A,00067,A,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00068_A,00068,A,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him
p00069_A,00069,A,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them
p00070_A,00070,A,this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow
p00071_A,00071,A,i admired your resolution very much sir in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon every body must have seen the snow coming on i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight
p00072_A,00072,A,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00073_A,00073,A,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses
p00074_A,00074,A,shall i ring the bell
p00075_A,00075,A,never madam never i assure you i think seriously of miss smith miss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object to every body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith no madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received
p00076_A,00076,A,mr elton is so good to the poor
p00077_A,00077,A,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00078_A,00078,A,thank you you are so kind oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here you are extremely kind you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting
p00079_A,00079,A,and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following as you will find from jane s letter so sudden you may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that i always make a point of reading jane s letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began to day with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her
p00080_A,00080,A,a very pleasant evening particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma you left nothing undone i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmother s it must have been a real indulgence
p00081_A,00081,A,i am happy you approved but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield
p00082_A,00082,A,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00083_A,00083,A,oh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained
p00084_A,00084,A,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00085_A,00085,A,true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax
p00086_A,00086,A,my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter i knew you would wish it there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like
p00087_A,00087,A,that s right my dear very right i had not thought of it before but that is the best way they must not over salt the leg and then if it is not over salted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome
p00088_A,00088,A,i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago he had just read elton s letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly
p00089_A,00089,A,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00090_A,00090,A,oh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us we may well say that well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well
p00091_A,00091,A,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00092_A,00092,A,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00093_A,00093,A,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00094_A,00094,A,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00095_A,00095,A,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00096_A,00096,A,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00097_A,00097,A,as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her nothing i suppose can be known one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance he has been gone only four weeks you are silent miss fairfax but i hope you mean to take an interest in this news you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins
p00098_A,00098,A,well my dear jane i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed i shall just go round by mrs cole s but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing good morning to you my dear sir oh mr knightley is coming too well that is so very i am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins good morning to you
p00099_A,00099,A,think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock
p00100_A,00100,A,four o clock depend upon it he will be here by three
p00101_A,00101,A,i told you yesterday i told you all that he would be here before the time named i remembered what i used to do myself one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs
p00102_A,00102,A,it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing
p00103_A,00103,A,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00104_A,00104,A,there is no necessity for my calling this morning another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which
p00105_A,00105,A,if you were never particularly struck by her manners before i think you will to day you will see her to advantage see her and hear her no i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue
p00106_A,00106,A,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00107_A,00107,A,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street
p00108_A,00108,A,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00109_A,00109,A,you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be
p00110_A,00110,A,yes i believe i do
p00111_A,00111,A,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00112_A,00112,A,it is a most repulsive quality indeed oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing there is safety in reserve but no attraction one cannot love a reserved person
p00113_A,00113,A,of course it must be declined
p00114_A,00114,A,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00115_A,00115,A,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00116_A,00116,A,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years
p00117_A,00117,A,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends
p00118_A,00118,A,nonsensical girl
p00119_A,00119,A,one can suppose nothing else and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening
p00120_A,00120,A,thank you for rousing me i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours
p00121_A,00121,A,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner
p00122_A,00122,A,this present from the campbells this pianoforte is very kindly given
p00123_A,00123,A,i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second
p00124_A,00124,A,perhaps it is as well i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours
p00125_A,00125,A,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased
p00126_A,00126,A,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood
p00127_A,00127,A,should i send it to mrs goddard s ma am
p00128_A,00128,A,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00129_A,00129,A,no trouble in the world ma am
p00130_A,00130,A,aye that will be much best i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddard s
p00131_A,00131,A,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00132_A,00132,A,what was i talking of i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill said he which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could said he i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some said he directly that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock said he so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning
p00133_A,00133,A,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00134_A,00134,A,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture
p00135_A,00135,A,what is the matter now
p00136_A,00136,A,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing
p00137_A,00137,A,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00138_A,00138,A,oh no it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man
p00139_A,00139,A,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room
p00140_A,00140,A,there is no denying it i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well
p00141_A,00141,A,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement
p00142_A,00142,A,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done
p00143_A,00143,A,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited
p00144_A,00144,A,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00145_A,00145,A,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00146_A,00146,A,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00147_A,00147,A,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00148_A,00148,A,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs
p00149_A,00149,A,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00150_A,00150,A,well if you please if you think she will be of any use
p00151_A,00151,A,oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure
p00152_A,00152,A,it was time to go
p00153_A,00153,A,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck
p00154_A,00154,A,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been
p00155_A,00155,A,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful
p00156_A,00156,A,and who do you think came in while we were there knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man
p00157_A,00157,A,we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to
p00158_A,00158,A,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her
p00159_A,00159,A,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00160_A,00160,A,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00161_A,00161,A,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond
p00162_A,00162,A,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me
p00163_A,00163,A,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have
p00164_A,00164,A,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again
p00165_A,00165,A,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder
p00166_A,00166,A,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart
p00167_A,00167,A,yes there is a likeness i know what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest
p00168_A,00168,A,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00169_A,00169,A,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00170_A,00170,A,he chose to say he was employed
p00171_A,00171,A,must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way
p00172_A,00172,A,read it read it it will give you pleasure only a few lines will not take you long read it to emma well he is coming you see good news i think well what do you say to it i always told you he would be here again soon did not i anne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe me in town next week you see at the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there to morrow or saturday as to her illness all nothing of course but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us this is precisely what i wanted well pretty good news is not it have you finished it has emma read it all put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way
p00173_A,00173,A,difference no indeed i am not
p00174_A,00174,A,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home
p00175_A,00175,A,but miss bates and miss fairfax we thought you were to bring them
p00176_A,00176,A,i will see that there are umbrellas sir miss bates must not be forgotten
p00177_A,00177,A,so very obliging of you no rain at all nothing to signify i do not care for myself quite thick shoes and jane declares well well this is brilliant indeed this is admirable excellently contrived upon my word nothing wanting could not have imagined it so well lighted up jane jane look did you ever see any thing oh mr weston you must really have had aladdin s lamp good mrs stokes would not know her own room again i saw her as i came in she was standing in the entrance said i but i had not time for more very well i thank you ma am i hope you are quite well very happy to hear it so afraid you might have a headache seeing you pass by so often and knowing how much trouble you must have delighted to hear it indeed ah dear mrs elton so obliged to you for the carriage excellent time jane and i quite ready did not keep the horses a moment most comfortable carriage oh and i am sure our thanks are due to you mrs weston on that score mrs elton had most kindly sent jane a note or we should have been but two such offers in one day never were such neighbours i said to my mother thank you my mother is remarkably well gone to mr woodhouse s i made her take her shawl for the evenings are not warm her large new shawl mrs dixon s wedding present so kind of her to think of my mother bought at weymouth you know mr dixon s choice there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time colonel campbell rather preferred an olive my dear jane are you sure you did not wet your feet it was but a drop or two but i am so afraid but mr frank churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon i shall never forget his extreme politeness oh mr frank churchill i must tell you my mother s spectacles have never been in fault since the rivet never came out again my mother often talks of your good nature does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill ah here s miss woodhouse dear miss woodhouse how do you do very well i thank you quite well this is meeting quite in fairy land such a transformation must not compliment i know that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look how do you like jane s hair you are a judge she did it all herself quite wonderful how she does her hair no hairdresser from london i think could ah dr hughes i declare and mrs hughes must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for a moment how do you do how do you do very well i thank you this is delightful is not it where s dear mr richard oh there he is don t disturb him much better employed talking to the young ladies how do you do mr richard i saw you the other day as you rode through the town mrs otway i protest and good mr otway and miss otway and miss caroline such a host of friends and mr george and mr arthur how do you do how do you all do quite well i am much obliged to you never better don t i hear another carriage who can this be very likely the worthy coles upon my word this is charming to be standing about among such friends and such a noble fire i am quite roasted no coffee i thank you for me never take coffee a little tea if you please sir by and bye no hurry oh here it comes every thing so good
p00178_A,00178,A,jane jane my dear jane where are you here is your tippet mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been done one door nailed up quantities of matting my dear jane indeed you must mr churchill oh you are too obliging how well you put it on so gratified excellent dancing indeed yes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed me i set off without saying a word just as i told you grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammon tea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners said i my dear sir you are too obliging is there nobody you would not rather i am not helpless sir you are most kind upon my word jane on one arm and me on the other stop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looks beautiful lace now we all follow in her train quite the queen of the evening well here we are at the passage two steps jane take care of the two steps oh no there is but one well i was persuaded there were two how very odd i was convinced there were two and there is but one i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style candles everywhere i was telling you of your grandmama jane there was a little disappointment the baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concerned well this is brilliant i am all amazement could not have supposed any thing such elegance and profusion i have seen nothing like it since well where shall we sit where shall we sit anywhere so that jane is not in a draught where i sit is of no consequence oh do you recommend this side well i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please what you direct in this house cannot be wrong dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama soup too bless me i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning
p00179_A,00179,A,and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself harriet smith has some first rate qualities which mrs elton is totally without an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton i found harriet more conversable than i expected
p00180_A,00180,A,come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing come emma set your companions the example every body is lazy every body is asleep
p00181_A,00181,A,brother and sister no indeed
p00182_A,00182,A,and had you really some at hand yourself i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally
p00183_A,00183,A,and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake
p00184_A,00184,A,upon my word i never heard of it till this moment
p00185_A,00185,A,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry
p00186_A,00186,A,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think
p00187_A,00187,A,i did not know that proper names were allowed
p00188_A,00188,A,aye very true my dear i was just going to say the same thing it is time for us to be going indeed the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too obliging we really must wish you good night
p00189_A,00189,A,you will not find either between donwell and highbury donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry come on a donkey however if you prefer it you can borrow mrs cole s i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible
p00190_A,00190,A,the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade
p00191_A,00191,A,i am i am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me miss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits mine i confess are exhausted the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary oh miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone
p00192_A,00192,A,these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself chuse your own degree of crossness i shall press you no more
p00193_A,00193,A,well if you wish me to stay and join the party i will
p00194_A,00194,A,three o clock yesterday that is your date i thought i had seen you first in february
p00195_A,00195,A,your gallantry is really unanswerable but
p00196_A,00196,A,nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people
p00197_A,00197,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of
p00198_A,00198,A,is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of
p00199_A,00199,A,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00200_A,00200,A,ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all
p00201_A,00201,A,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00202_A,00202,A,ah well to be sure yes i see what she means and i will try to hold my tongue i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend
p00203_A,00203,A,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00204_A,00204,A,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00205_A,00205,A,what two letters express perfection i am sure i do not know
p00206_A,00206,A,ah you will never guess you i am certain will never guess i will tell you m and a em ma do you understand
p00207_A,00207,A,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00208_A,00208,A,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00209_A,00209,A,with all my heart i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot come jane take my other arm
p00210_A,00210,A,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever
p00211_A,00211,A,very well i undertake the commission you shall have a charming wife
p00212_A,00212,A,she must be very lively and have hazle eyes i care for nothing else i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife remember
p00213_A,00213,A,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p00214_A,00214,A,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p00215_A,00215,A,i am afraid jane is not very well but i do not know they tell me she is well i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse i hope you find a chair i wish hetty had not gone i am very little able have you a chair ma am do you sit where you like i am sure she will be here presently
p00216_A,00216,A,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s
p00217_A,00217,A,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p00218_A,00218,A,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time
p00219_A,00219,A,has your son been with you then
p00220_A,00220,A,well my dear i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me
p00221_A,00221,A,i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea
p00222_A,00222,A,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady
p00223_A,00223,A,true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe
p00224_A,00224,A,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error
p00225_A,00225,A,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful
p00226_A,00226,A,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come are you well my emma
p00227_A,00227,A,what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged
p00228_A,00228,A,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday
p00229_A,00229,A,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children
p00230_A,00230,A,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it
p00231_A,00231,A,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose
p00232_A,00232,A,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for
p00233_A,00233,A,it is frank and miss fairfax i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope
p00234_A,00234,A,very beautiful indeed
p00000_B,00000,B,it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk
p00001_B,00001,B,especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature that is what you have in your head i know and what you would certainly say if my father were not by
p00002_B,00002,B,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
p00003_B,00003,B,emma knows i never flatter her but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be a gainer
p00004_B,00004,B,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
p00005_B,00005,B,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married
p00006_B,00006,B,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing
p00007_B,00007,B,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches
p00008_B,00008,B,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said
p00009_B,00009,B,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously
p00010_B,00010,B,only one more papa only for mr elton poor mr elton you like mr elton papa i must look about for a wife for him there is nobody in highbury who deserves him and he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longer and i thought when he was joining their hands to day he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service
p00011_B,00011,B,with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife depend upon it a man of six or seven and twenty can take care of himself
p00012_B,00012,B,mrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome serle understands boiling an egg better than any body i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit ours are all apple tarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here i do not advise the custard mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine a small half glass put into a tumbler of water i do not think it could disagree with you
p00013_B,00013,B,well done mrs martin you know what you are about
p00014_B,00014,B,let me entreat you it would indeed be a delight let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend i know what your drawings are how could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls
p00015_B,00015,B,do you think so i cannot agree with you it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature i never saw such a likeness in my life we must allow for the effect of shade you know
p00016_B,00016,B,you have made her too tall emma
p00017_B,00017,B,it is very pretty so prettily done just as your drawings always are my dear i do not know any body who draws so well as you do the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shoulders and it makes one think she must catch cold
p00018_B,00018,B,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree
p00019_B,00019,B,you sir may say any thing but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit any other situation would have been much less in character the naivete of miss smith s manners and altogether oh it is most admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it i never saw such a likeness
p00020_B,00020,B,what a precious deposit
p00021_B,00021,B,upon my word the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking he will connect himself well if he can
p00022_B,00022,B,i cannot rate her beauty as you do but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman
p00023_B,00023,B,i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting
p00024_B,00024,B,very well mr elton very well indeed i have read worse charades courtship a very good hint i give you credit for it this is feeling your way this is saying very plainly pray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance harriet exactly soft is the very word for her eye of all epithets the justest that could be given humph harriet s ready wit all the better a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so ah mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken an excellent charade indeed and very much to the purpose things must come to a crisis soon now
p00025_B,00025,B,what can it be miss woodhouse what can it be i have not an idea i cannot guess it in the least what can it possibly be do try to find it out miss woodhouse do help me i never saw any thing so hard is it kingdom i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady do you think it is a good one can it be woman can it be neptune or a trident or a mermaid or a shark oh no shark is only one syllable it must be very clever or he would not have brought it oh miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out
p00026_B,00026,B,yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh a piece of paper was found on the table this morning dropt we suppose by a fairy containing a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in
p00027_B,00027,B,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not
p00028_B,00028,B,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him
p00029_B,00029,B,oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry
p00030_B,00030,B,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much
p00031_B,00031,B,part of my lace is gone and i do not know how i am to contrive i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so ill equipped mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on
p00032_B,00032,B,oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret
p00033_B,00033,B,very much to the honour of both
p00034_B,00034,B,and do you see her sir tolerably often
p00035_B,00035,B,not near so often my dear as i could wish
p00036_B,00036,B,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth
p00037_B,00037,B,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied
p00038_B,00038,B,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again
p00039_B,00039,B,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston
p00040_B,00040,B,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can
p00041_B,00041,B,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor
p00042_B,00042,B,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately
p00043_B,00043,B,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps
p00044_B,00044,B,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else
p00045_B,00045,B,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords
p00046_B,00046,B,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree
p00047_B,00047,B,john how are you
p00048_B,00048,B,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you
p00049_B,00049,B,oh good mr perry how is he sir
p00050_B,00050,B,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where
p00051_B,00051,B,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them
p00052_B,00052,B,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir
p00053_B,00053,B,why pretty well my dear upon the whole but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago
p00054_B,00054,B,i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking well but i hope it is only from being a little fatigued i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home
p00055_B,00055,B,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong
p00056_B,00056,B,that sweet amiable jane fairfax it is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all she would be such a delightful companion for emma
p00057_B,00057,B,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet
p00058_B,00058,B,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself
p00059_B,00059,B,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion
p00060_B,00060,B,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night
p00061_B,00061,B,well this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her
p00062_B,00062,B,i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works
p00063_B,00063,B,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it
p00064_B,00064,B,can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable
p00065_B,00065,B,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself
p00066_B,00066,B,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world
p00067_B,00067,B,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him
p00068_B,00068,B,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better
p00069_B,00069,B,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine
p00070_B,00070,B,what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done
p00071_B,00071,B,you had better order the carriage directly my love i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk i am not at all afraid i should not mind walking half the way i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold
p00072_B,00072,B,indeed then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold walk home you are prettily shod for walking home i dare say it will be bad enough for the horses
p00073_B,00073,B,i am ready if the others are
p00074_B,00074,B,i am very much astonished mr elton this to me you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please
p00075_B,00075,B,if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet here have i actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him oh that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin there i was quite right that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her william coxe oh no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer
p00076_B,00076,B,have you heard from miss fairfax so lately i am extremely happy i hope she is well
p00077_B,00077,B,my mother s deafness is very trifling you see just nothing at all by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me jane speaks so distinct however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mother s time of life and it really is full two years you know since she was here we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now
p00078_B,00078,B,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon
p00079_B,00079,B,she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome
p00080_B,00080,B,no my dear that i am sure you are not there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are if any thing you are too attentive the muffin last night if it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough
p00081_B,00081,B,no you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension i think you understand me therefore
p00082_B,00082,B,miss fairfax is reserved
p00083_B,00083,B,i hope every body had a pleasant evening i had once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me miss bates was very chatty and good humoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very well behaved young lady indeed she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma
p00084_B,00084,B,she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart
p00085_B,00085,B,it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined a great pity indeed and i have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small trifling presents of any thing uncommon now we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicate hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast pork i think we had better send the leg do not you think so my dear
p00086_B,00086,B,emma i have a piece of news for you you like news and i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you
p00087_B,00087,B,news oh yes i always like news what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls
p00088_B,00088,B,we consider our hartfield pork indeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than
p00089_B,00089,B,it was short merely to announce but cheerful exulting of course he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled
p00090_B,00090,B,mr elton going to be married he will have every body s wishes for his happiness
p00091_B,00091,B,he is very young to settle he had better not be in a hurry he seemed to me very well off as he was we were always glad to see him at hartfield
p00092_B,00092,B,a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him
p00093_B,00093,B,no i have never seen mr elton is he is he a tall man
p00094_B,00094,B,who shall answer that question my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind
p00095_B,00095,B,very true miss woodhouse so she will he is the very best young man but my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman his extreme attention to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you know it is not much but she does not hear quite quick jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf he fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she says it did him no lasting benefit colonel campbell you know is quite our angel and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry i say sir i think there are few places with such society as highbury i always say we are quite blessed in our neighbours my dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork a roast loin of pork
p00096_B,00096,B,when i have seen mr elton i dare say i shall be interested but i believe it requires that with me and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off
p00097_B,00097,B,yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse four weeks yesterday a miss hawkins well i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i ever mrs cole once whispered to me but i immediately said in short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries i do not pretend to it what is before me i see at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspired miss woodhouse lets me chatter on so good humouredly she knows i would not offend for the world how does miss smith do she seems quite recovered now have you heard from mrs john knightley lately oh those dear little children jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley i mean in person tall and with that sort of look and not very talkative
p00098_B,00098,B,it might be distressing for the moment but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is over and may never can never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it
p00099_B,00099,B,will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford
p00100_B,00100,B,my dear dear anxious friend always overcareful for every body s comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here i am sure they will bring him soon
p00101_B,00101,B,elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably well looking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston
p00102_B,00102,B,you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
p00103_B,00103,B,as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper name i should rather say barnes or bates do you know any family of that name
p00104_B,00104,B,i have heard her speak of the acquaintance she is a very elegant young woman
p00105_B,00105,B,my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me
p00106_B,00106,B,my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs bates s he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump
p00107_B,00107,B,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before
p00108_B,00108,B,and how did you think miss fairfax looking
p00109_B,00109,B,you get upon delicate subjects emma remember that i am here mr frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax s situation in life i will move a little farther off
p00110_B,00110,B,i certainly do forget to think of her as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend
p00111_B,00111,B,did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play
p00112_B,00112,B,all young people would have their little whims all young people would have their little whims
p00113_B,00113,B,well sir as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it
p00114_B,00114,B,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa
p00115_B,00115,B,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party
p00116_B,00116,B,oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up
p00117_B,00117,B,i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly
p00118_B,00118,B,why do you smile
p00119_B,00119,B,nay why do you
p00120_B,00120,B,how they were invited were not they
p00121_B,00121,B,i often feel concern that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose
p00122_B,00122,B,that will do you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet
p00123_B,00123,B,miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her
p00124_B,00124,B,don t class us together harriet my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine
p00125_B,00125,B,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument
p00126_B,00126,B,do come with me if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it
p00127_B,00127,B,it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels
p00128_B,00128,B,no trouble in the world ma am
p00129_B,00129,B,that you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please mrs ford
p00130_B,00130,B,i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
p00131_B,00131,B,how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon i did not see you before i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town jane came back delighted yesterday thank ye the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in
p00132_B,00132,B,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate
p00133_B,00133,B,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her
p00134_B,00134,B,you speak too plain she must understand you
p00135_B,00135,B,i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing
p00136_B,00136,B,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room
p00137_B,00137,B,is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing
p00138_B,00138,B,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well
p00139_B,00139,B,well miss woodhouse your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn
p00140_B,00140,B,the crown
p00141_B,00141,B,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house
p00142_B,00142,B,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable
p00143_B,00143,B,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight
p00144_B,00144,B,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
p00145_B,00145,B,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her
p00146_B,00146,B,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry
p00147_B,00147,B,my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you
p00148_B,00148,B,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
p00149_B,00149,B,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates
p00150_B,00150,B,but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know
p00151_B,00151,B,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls
p00152_B,00152,B,i certainly must this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes
p00153_B,00153,B,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me
p00154_B,00154,B,elegantly dressed and very pleasing
p00155_B,00155,B,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties
p00156_B,00156,B,well my dear considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane
p00157_B,00157,B,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting
p00158_B,00158,B,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change
p00159_B,00159,B,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness
p00160_B,00160,B,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax
p00161_B,00161,B,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me
p00162_B,00162,B,this is very true at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done
p00163_B,00163,B,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me
p00164_B,00164,B,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before
p00165_B,00165,B,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart
p00166_B,00166,B,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston
p00167_B,00167,B,i never saw any gentleman s handwriting mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw
p00168_B,00168,B,i do not admire it it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing
p00169_B,00169,B,he chose to say he was employed
p00170_B,00170,B,oh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best
p00171_B,00171,B,but i have never fixed on june or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general
p00172_B,00172,B,oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage
p00173_B,00173,B,yes it is randalls that does it all
p00174_B,00174,B,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts
p00175_B,00175,B,a very fine young man indeed mr weston you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me i never compliment i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them they were never tolerated at maple grove neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better
p00176_B,00176,B,i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious i believe we drive faster than any body what a pleasure it is to send one s carriage for a friend i understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary you may be very sure i shall always take care of them
p00177_B,00177,B,oh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion i was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us
p00178_B,00178,B,i did and they cannot forgive me
p00179_B,00179,B,i am ready whenever i am wanted
p00180_B,00180,B,whom are you going to dance with
p00181_B,00181,B,yes i hope i do
p00182_B,00182,B,lord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court plaister that frank churchill had been pulling about i never was equal to this
p00183_B,00183,B,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment
p00184_B,00184,B,what is this what is this about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you
p00185_B,00185,B,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed
p00186_B,00186,B,miss woodhouse have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again
p00187_B,00187,B,pray emma may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other
p00188_B,00188,B,oh it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves
p00189_B,00189,B,the best fruit in england every body s favourite always wholesome these the finest beds and finest sorts delightful to gather for one s self the only way of really enjoying them morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in london abundance about bristol maple grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade
p00190_B,00190,B,certainly if you wish it but you are not going to walk to highbury alone
p00191_B,00191,B,you will soon be cooler if you sit still
p00192_B,00192,B,how much i am obliged to you for telling me to come to day if it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again
p00193_B,00193,B,yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a kinder friend than you deserved but you were humble you begged hard to be commanded to come
p00194_B,00194,B,nobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people
p00195_B,00195,B,i say nothing of which i am ashamed i saw you first in february let every body on the hill hear me if they can let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other i saw you first in february
p00196_B,00196,B,our companions are excessively stupid what shall we do to rouse them any nonsense will serve they shall talk
p00197_B,00197,B,oh no no upon no account in the world it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of i will not say quite all there are one or two perhaps whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing
p00198_B,00198,B,it is a sort of thing which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into though perhaps as the chaperon of the party i never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women
p00199_B,00199,B,very true my love very true exactly so indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing better pass it off as a joke every body knows what is due to you
p00200_B,00200,B,ah ma am but there may be a difficulty pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once
p00201_B,00201,B,i like your plan agreed agreed i will do my best i am making a conundrum how will a conundrum reckon
p00202_B,00202,B,low i am afraid sir very low but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way
p00203_B,00203,B,no no it will not reckon low a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour come sir pray let me hear it
p00204_B,00204,B,i doubt its being very clever myself it is too much a matter of fact but here it is what two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection
p00205_B,00205,B,this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else perfection should not have come quite so soon
p00206_B,00206,B,oh for myself i protest i must be excused i really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with i knew who it came from an abominable puppy you know who i mean these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer miss woodhouse must excuse me i am not one of those who have witty things at every body s service i do not pretend to be a wit i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue pass us if you please mr churchill pass mr e knightley jane and myself we have nothing clever to say not one of us
p00207_B,00207,B,yes yes pray pass me i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady an old married man quite good for nothing shall we walk augusta
p00208_B,00208,B,happy couple how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath peculiarly lucky for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that bath or any public place can give it is all nothing there can be no knowledge it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment short of that it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life
p00209_B,00209,B,such things do occur undoubtedly
p00210_B,00210,B,and make her like myself
p00211_B,00211,B,now ma am shall we join mrs elton
p00212_B,00212,B,if you please my dear with all my heart i am quite ready i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well we shall soon overtake her there she is no that s somebody else that s one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her well i declare
p00213_B,00213,B,emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation emma i had not thought it possible
p00214_B,00214,B,nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me
p00215_B,00215,B,where may i ask is miss fairfax going
p00216_B,00216,B,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme
p00217_B,00217,B,well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them
p00218_B,00218,B,i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long
p00219_B,00219,B,well my dear i have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better i shall leave you together there is no use in delay i shall not be far off if you want me
p00220_B,00220,B,what is it my dear friend something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurred do let me know directly what it is i have been walking all this way in complete suspense we both abhor suspense do not let mine continue longer it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be
p00221_B,00221,B,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear
p00222_B,00222,B,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error
p00223_B,00223,B,much indeed if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter
p00224_B,00224,B,harriet poor harriet but with common sense i am afraid i have had little to do
p00225_B,00225,B,oh god that i had never seen her
p00226_B,00226,B,you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you
p00227_B,00227,B,a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable
p00228_B,00228,B,your parish there was small
p00229_B,00229,B,very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted
p00230_B,00230,B,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent
p00231_B,00231,B,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend
p00232_B,00232,B,she has had the advantage you know of practising on me like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan
p00233_B,00233,B,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person
p00234_B,00234,B,perry my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage such an extraordinary dream of mine i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others
