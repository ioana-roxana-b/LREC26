p00717_A,00717,A,on your side my love it was very innocently done but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in was that of making her unreasonable the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear said she she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself,1,80.25,70.7,24.2,17.83,3.18,0.64,3.82,10.19,0,6.37,5.1,14.65,12.74,5.1,6.37,1.27,3.82

p01165_A,01165,A,my dear madam nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton when frank left us it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this day s news doubly welcome it has been completely unexpected that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding how could he contrive to come and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forth i always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next,1,81.25,65.63,23.13,13.13,5,1.88,1.88,3.75,0.63,10,2.5,5.63,14.38,11.88,8.13,1.88,4.38
p01166_A,01166,A,you were mentioning may may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombe in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended now will be the time this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to day or to morrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house i think it is so i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy mrs weston s partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me she thinks nobody equal to him,1,79.84,64.52,14.11,9.68,2.42,2.02,2.02,3.23,0,4.44,6.45,13.31,13.31,7.26,8.06,2.82,6.45
p01167_A,01167,A,i hope i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her she was the instigator frank s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wife s his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has out churchill d them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart,1,77.61,67.16,20.4,16.92,4.48,0.5,1,10.45,0.5,3.48,5.47,13.43,14.43,2.99,8.96,3.98,2.99

p01169_A,01169,A,and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it of you,1,75,64.06,28.13,20.31,7.81,3.13,7.81,1.56,0,7.81,1.56,9.38,12.5,4.69,4.69,3.13,1.56

p01175_A,01175,A,aye like maple grove i dare say nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove such an immense plantation all round it you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life i always say a woman cannot have too many resources and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society,1,72.73,63.64,12.12,8.08,5.05,0,1.01,2.02,0,4.04,5.05,15.15,9.09,7.07,7.07,4.04,8.08

p01178_A,01178,A,and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchill at the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer,1,75,65,27.5,20,11.25,0,3.75,2.5,1.25,7.5,1.25,13.75,11.25,5,6.25,2.5,3.75
