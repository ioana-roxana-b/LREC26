Mr. Knightley,Mr. Woodhouse,16,18,poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence at any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two,i believe it is very true my dear indeed i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma

Mr. Woodhouse,Emma,22,24,dear emma bears every thing so well but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for,and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me and a very considerable one that i made the match myself i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing,Emma; Mr. Knightley,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Mr. Woodhouse,23,25,it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. Knightley,25,27,ah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass pray do not make any more matches,i do not understand what you mean by success success supposes endeavour your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage a worthy employment for a young lady s mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where is your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said,Emma; Mr. Knightley,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,28,30,and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck there is always some talent in it and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a third a something between the do nothing and the do all if i had not promoted mr weston s visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that,emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up one s family circle grievously,Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma

Mr. Elton,Emma,120,122,oh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know proportions fore shortening oh no it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smith s exactly so indeed,but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer look at the tree,Emma; Harriet Smith; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Harriet Smith,Emma,244,246,i dare say they are sir i am sure i do not know who is not,he appears rough to you because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate father certainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father the children are all fond of him,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Emma,249,251,well i cannot understand it,oh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smith s collection your friend will not take it amiss i hope of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two he may be sure of every woman s approbation while he writes with such gallantry,Emma; Harriet Smith,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Elton,Harriet Smith,252,254,i have no hesitation in saying i have no hesitation in saying at least if my friend feels at all as i do i have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life,oh what a sweet house how very beautiful there are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much,Emma; Harriet Smith,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Isabella,Emma,283,285,and do you see her sir tolerably often,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. John Knightley,284,286,not near so often my dear as i could wish,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied,Emma; Isabella; Mr. John Knightley,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,285,287,oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose isabella most frequently here they are very very kind in their visits mr weston is really as kind as herself papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. John Knightley,Emma,286,288,just as it should be and just as i hoped it was from your letters her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emma s account i hope you will be satisfied,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston,Emma; Isabella; Mr. Woodhouse,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. John Knightley,287,289,why to be sure yes certainly i cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often but then she is always obliged to go away again,i think indeed that mr weston has some little claim you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,Emma; Isabella; Mr. John Knightley,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Isabella,288,290,it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr weston,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Isabella,Emma,290,292,me my love are you talking about me i am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve i believe he is one of the very best tempered men that ever existed excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper i shall never forget his flying henry s kite for him that very windy day last easter and ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve o clock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence if any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor,he has not been here yet there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. John Knightley,Mr. Woodhouse,291,293,where is the young man has he been here on this occasion or has he not,but you should tell them of the letter my dear he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was she shewed it to me i thought it very well done of him indeed whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell he is but young and his uncle perhaps,Emma; Isabella; Mr. Woodhouse,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Isabella,294,296,my dear papa he is three and twenty you forget how time passes,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. John Knightley,295,297,three and twenty is he indeed well i could not have thought it and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother well time does fly indeed and my memory is very bad however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept 28th and began but i forget how it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill i remember that perfectly,nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john mr weston is rather an easy cheerful tempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords,Emma; Isabella; Mr. John Knightley,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Isabella,Emma,296,298,how very pleasing and proper of him i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father there is something so shocking in a child s being taken away from his parents and natural home i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him to give up one s child i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else,what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Knightley,308,310,ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me,john how are you,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,Emma
Isabella,Emma,312,314,mr wingfield most strenuously recommended it sir or we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat both sea air and bathing,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Isabella,313,315,ah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body i am sure it almost killed me once,oh good mr perry how is he sir,Emma; Isabella,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,314,316,come come i must beg you not to talk of the sea it makes me envious and miserable i who have never seen it south end is prohibited if you please my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you,why pretty well but not quite well poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not time to take care of himself which is very sad but he is always wanted all round the country i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere but then there is not so clever a man any where,Isabella; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Isabella,Emma,319,321,oh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfield s which we have been applying at times ever since august,you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates i have not heard one inquiry after them,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Isabella,320,322,it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to,oh the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters i hope they are quite well good old mrs bates i will call upon her to morrow and take my children they are always so pleased to see my children and that excellent miss bates such thorough worthy people how are they sir,Emma; Isabella,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma

Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,335,337,i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother about your friend mr graham s intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate what will it answer will not the old prejudice be too strong,our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person you will like harriet emma could not have a better companion than harriet,Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Isabella,Mr. John Knightley,344,346,but my dear sir the difference of the journey only consider how great it would have been an hundred miles perhaps instead of forty,mr perry would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another i may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry i want his directions no more than his drugs if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself,Emma; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. Knightley,345,347,ah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred better not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air this is just what perry said it seemed to him a very ill judged measure,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion,Emma; Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Emma,347,349,true true very true that s a consideration indeed but john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps i shall see you at the abbey to morrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion,it is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to morrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to night,Emma; Isabella; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,F,major,Emma
Mr. Elton,Emma,350,352,very cold certainly very cold,well this is most strange after i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behind most strange indeed but there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked what a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her,Emma; Mr. John Knightley,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. John Knightley,351,353,you do quite right we will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston,i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works,Mr. Elton; Mr. John Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. John Knightley,366,368,he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day,yes and i think we shall have a good deal of it,Mr. Elton; Mr. John Knightley,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Elton,Emma,373,375,indeed i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment,can it really be as my brother imagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable,Emma; Mr. John Knightley,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Weston,Emma,376,378,my son frank my son,what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself,Emma; Isabella; Mr. Elton; Mr. John Knightley; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Weston,Emma,381,383,yes i have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my life she is an odd woman but i never allow myself to speak ill of her on frank s account for i do believe her to be very fond of him i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her way allowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world,Emma,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mrs. Weston,383,385,yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill humour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him,Mrs. Weston,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,385,387,you must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks it depends entirely upon his aunt s spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper to you to my two daughters i may venture on the truth mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very odd tempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him,and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain i am sorry for it the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better,Emma; Isabella,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Isabella,Mrs. Weston,386,388,oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion to be constantly living with an ill tempered person must be dreadful it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery what a blessing that she never had any children poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them,yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves there is jealousy they are jealous even of his regard for his father in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine,Emma; Mrs. Weston,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma

Miss Bates,Emma,448,450,thank you you are so kind oh here it is i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her a letter from jane that she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswife and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letter only two pages you see hardly two and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well she often says when the letter is first opened don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word and indeed though my mother s eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god with the help of spectacles it is such a blessing my mother s are really very good indeed jane often says when she is here you are extremely kind you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself i am sure there is nobody s praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouse s my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know ma am do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting,are you expecting miss fairfax here soon,Emma; Harriet Smith; Mrs. Bates,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. Frank Churchill,535,537,but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street,yes oh yes i was just going to mention it a very successful visit i saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Weston,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma

Emma,Mr. Weston,577,579,but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa,but my dear sir if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party,Mr. Weston; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Weston,Emma,581,583,but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence they are good natured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any body s hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouse s doing it would be more thought of than any other person s in the room you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years,oh yes papa i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account i am only afraid of your sitting up for me i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort you must promise me not to sit up,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Emma,582,584,no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain i know what worthy people they are perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor you would not think it to look at him but he is bilious mr cole is very bilious no i would not be the means of giving them any pain my dear emma we must consider this i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish you will not regard being tired you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends,i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always folly it depends upon the character of those who handle it mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man if he were he would have done this differently he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly,Emma; Mr. Weston; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Emma,588,590,nonsensical girl,why do you smile,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Cole,Mr. Frank Churchill,589,591,one can suppose nothing else and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present they might chuse to surprize her i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction it always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing room while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening,nay why do you,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Weston; Mrs. Weston,F,minor,M,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,617,619,thank you for rousing me i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that i cannot keep my eyes from her i never saw any thing so outree those curls this must be a fancy of her own i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion shall i yes i will i declare i will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours,how they were invited were not they,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,642,644,there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have a very strong notion that it comes from him i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner,i often feel concern that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should put to for such a purpose,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Mrs. Weston,Emma,671,673,i thought you meant to go with me they would be very much pleased,i am here on no business of my own i am only waiting for my friend she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Mrs. Weston,674,676,well if you advise it but if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall i say i shall be no support to mrs weston she might do very well by herself a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood,do come with me if it be not very disagreeable to you it need not detain us long we will go to hartfield afterwards we will follow them to hartfield i really wish you to call with me it will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you meant it,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,intermediate,Emma

Miss Bates,Mrs. Weston,689,691,what was i talking of i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of oh my mother s spectacles so very obliging of mr frank churchill said he which you know shewed him to be so very indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly he seems every thing the fondest parent could said he i never shall forget his manner and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some said he directly that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwell some of mr knightley s most liberal supply he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees i believe there is two of them my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days but i was really quite shocked the other day for mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock said he so i begged he would not for really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with me no i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them all and now his master had not one left to bake or boil william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple tart this spring he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world he would be so very i wanted to keep it from jane s knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish miss smith pray take care miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot miss smith the step at the turning,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate,Emma; Harriet Smith; Mrs. Weston,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,691,693,what have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate,it is not fair mine was a random guess do not distress her,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Emma,695,697,till i have a letter from colonel campbell i can imagine nothing with any confidence it must be all conjecture,you speak too plain she must understand you,Emma; Harriet Smith; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Miss Bates,719,721,what is the matter now,i have not been able to succeed mr knightley cannot stop he is going to kingston he asked me if he could do any thing,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Mr. Frank Churchill,722,724,yes we heard his kind offers we heard every thing,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,Emma; Harriet Smith; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Weston,F,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Mr. Woodhouse,724,726,you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley yes that will be quite enough for pleasure you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room,is very thoughtless do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately he does not think of the draught i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing,Emma; Mr. Weston; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Mr. Frank Churchill,725,727,oh no it would be the extreme of imprudence i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong she would catch a dreadful cold so would poor little harriet so you would all mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing pray do not let them talk of it that young man,we were too magnificent we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Weston; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,730,732,no no you are quite unreasonable it would be dreadful to be standing so close nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room,well miss woodhouse your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father s little rooms i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Weston; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,731,733,there is no denying it i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words exquisite quite exquisite still however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up it would be a disappointment to my father and altogether i do not know that i am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well,the crown,Emma; Mr. Weston; Mr. Woodhouse; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,735,737,it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happy it seems the only improvement that could be papa do you not think it an excellent improvement,sir you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Emma,741,743,have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Mr. Woodhouse,742,744,but unfortunately sir my time is so limited,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,743,745,oh there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over there is no hurry at all if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses they will be so near their own stable,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,major,Emma
Mr. Woodhouse,Emma,744,746,so they will my dear that is a great thing not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is mrs stokes to be trusted i doubt it i do not know her even by sight,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Mr. Woodhouse,745,747,i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs weston s care mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,aye very true mr perry did say so i shall never forget it poor little emma you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very good sort which was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint i hope whenever poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,746,748,there papa now you must be satisfied our own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her,my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment examining the capabilities of the house i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot i was desired to say so from both it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there they can do nothing satisfactorily without you,Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,major,Emma
Mr. Weston,Mr. Frank Churchill,752,754,you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Emma,754,756,yes very true very true you want your neighbours opinions i do not wonder at you if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance they are not far off shall i call upon them or miss bates she is still nearer and i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body i think we do want a larger council suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us,you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing she will not even listen to your questions i see no advantage in consulting miss bates,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Mr. Frank Churchill,755,757,well if you please if you think she will be of any use,but she is so amusing so extremely amusing i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk and i need not bring the whole family you know,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill,F,intermediate,M,major,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Emma,764,766,oh miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball what a disappointment it would be i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure,but you will come again this will not be your only visit to randalls,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Weston,Emma,778,780,it was time to go,i certainly must this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least well evil to some is always good to others i shall have many fellow mourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes,Emma; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Woodhouse,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Emma,781,783,you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck,your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten it i assure you deceived myself i did very miserably deceive you and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of self command in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity these are the motives which i have been pressing on you they are very important and sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration i want you to save yourself from greater pain perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was due or rather what would be kind by me,Emma,M,major,F,major,Emma
Harriet Smith,Emma,784,786,you who have been the best friend i ever had in my life want gratitude to you nobody is equal to you i care for nobody as i do for you oh miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been,elegantly dressed and very pleasing,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma
Harriet Smith,Emma,795,797,yes and well she might nobody could ever have a better well i wish them happy with all my heart and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again he is just as superior as ever but being married you know it is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort she does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves happy creature he called her augusta how delightful,when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Elton,Mr. Woodhouse,814,816,and who do you think came in while we were there knightley knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr e s i had a great curiosity my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend knightley is quite the gentleman i like him very much decidedly i think a very gentleman like man,well my dear considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too quick a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor however she seems a very obliging pretty behaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife though i think he had better not have married i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane,Emma; Mr. Elton; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,830,832,we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting,Emma; Mr. Knightley,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Mrs. Weston,831,833,you are right mrs weston miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her but she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mr. Knightley,832,834,such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax mrs elton s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting,another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before we feel things differently and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness,Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,F,major,M,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,833,835,i should not wonder if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunt s eagerness in accepting mrs elton s civilities for her poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change,i know how highly you think of jane fairfax,Emma; Mr. Knightley,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Mrs. Weston,846,848,jane fairfax has feeling i do not accuse her of want of feeling her sensibilities i suspect are strong and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience self control but it wants openness she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me,Emma; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,848,850,why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me,this is very true at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now i have neglected her too long but i will shew her greater attention than i have done,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. John Knightley,Jane Fairfax,861,863,when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings i consider one as including the other time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle but that is not the change i had in view for you as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have,yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me,Jane Fairfax,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Jane Fairfax,867,869,my advice i certainly do feel tempted to give miss fairfax you must not run such risks liable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year the spring i always think requires more than common care better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again now do not you feel that you had yes i am sure you are much too reasonable you look as if you would not do such a thing again,you are extremely kind but i cannot give up my early walk i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before,Jane Fairfax; Mrs. Elton,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Mr. John Knightley,875,877,so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrong and not one in a million i suppose actually lost and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart,Mr. John Knightley,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. John Knightley,Mr. Woodhouse,877,879,i have heard it asserted that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get isabella and emma i think do write very much alike i have not always known their writing apart,isabella and emma both write beautifully and always did and so does poor mrs weston,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma

Mr. John Knightley,Emma,942,944,very well and as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way and if they are i only beg you to send them home,upon my word you amuse me i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys these amazing engagements of mine what have they been dining once with the coles and having a ball talked of which never took place i can understand you your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed but you who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one and who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts,Emma; Mr. Knightley,M,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Emma,Harriet Smith,990,992,and so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake,here here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the court plaister never did this was really his do not you remember one morning no i dare say you do not but one morning i forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket book it was about spruce beer mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce beer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Mr. Weston,1017,1019,upon my word i never heard of it till this moment,what is this what is this about perry and a carriage is perry going to set up his carriage frank i am glad he can afford it you had it from himself had you,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Weston,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Frank Churchill,Miss Bates,1020,1022,no sir i seem to have had it from nobody very odd i really was persuaded of mrs weston s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particulars but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream i am a great dreamer i dream of every body at highbury when i am away and when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry,why to own the truth if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might have i do not mean to say that he did not dream it i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed jane don t you remember grandmama s telling us of it when we got home i forget where we had been walking to very likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls mrs perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed i do not know who is not and she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not i am not like jane i wish i were i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Weston; Mrs. Weston,M,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Weston,Mr. Frank Churchill,1021,1023,it is odd though that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage and his wife s persuading him to it out of care for his health just what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream and at others what a heap of absurdities it is well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent emma you are a great dreamer i think,miss woodhouse have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again,Emma; Harriet Smith; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Knightley; Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,M,major,Emma

Jane Fairfax,Emma,1124,1126,i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever,and make her like myself,Emma; Harriet Smith; Miss Bates; Mr. Frank Churchill; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Weston,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma

Miss Bates,Emma,1157,1159,yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it it was before tea stay no it could not be before tea because we were just going to cards and yet it was before tea because i remember thinking oh no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdy s son wanted to speak with him poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all and poor john s son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond that was what happened before tea it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte what is to become of that very true poor dear jane was talking of it just now said she said she and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,Emma; Mrs. Bates,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Woodhouse,1159,1161,nothing at all but is not this a sudden scheme,well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before she is always so attentive to them,Harriet Smith; Mr. Knightley; Mr. Woodhouse,F,major,M,intermediate,Emma
Mr. Knightley,Mr. Woodhouse,1160,1162,yes rather i have been thinking of it some little time,i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled mrs elton is very good natured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylor s always was with me you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long,Emma; Harriet Smith; Mr. Woodhouse,M,major,M,intermediate,Emma

Mr. Weston,Mrs. Weston,1182,1184,i have been as good as my word she has not the least idea,have you indeed no idea cannot you my dear emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear,Mrs. Weston,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Mrs. Weston,1209,1211,you are in luck your only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error,Mrs. Weston,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,1210,1212,true but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe,much indeed if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing but you really frightened me i thought you had lost half your property at least and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulation i congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,1211,1213,now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match let us make the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for and still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right and how much may be said in her situation for even that error,harriet poor harriet but with common sense i am afraid i have had little to do,Emma; Mr. Weston,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Harriet Smith,Emma,1236,1238,mr martin no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it i never should have presumed to think of it at first but for you you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mine and so i have but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful,oh god that i had never seen her,Emma,F,major,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,1247,1249,we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come are you well my emma,you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Miss Bates,Mrs. Elton,1291,1293,what are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton that will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr elton s time is so engaged,a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Elton,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Emma,Jane Fairfax,1297,1299,have not you mistaken the day i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to morrow mr knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday,your parish there was small,Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Elton,F,major,F,intermediate,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Mrs. Elton,1301,1303,but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than five and twenty children,very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come but you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared here have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience for who can say you know how soon it may be wanted,Emma; Miss Bates; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Elton,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Mrs. Elton,Emma,1307,1309,i cannot imagine i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world the very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten my dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he must not even knightley could be so very eccentric and his servants forgot it depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it,it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct i feel that i should certainly have been impertinent,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mr. Elton; Mrs. Bates,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mr. Elton,Jane Fairfax,1308,1310,i met william larkins as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe him william seemed rather out of humour he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him i have nothing to do with william s wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley to day and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose,oh there would have been no danger the danger would have been of my wearying you you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest indeed miss woodhouse with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as to i have not time for half that i could wish to say i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself i feel it so very due but unfortunately in short if your compassion does not stand my friend,Emma; Jane Fairfax; Miss Bates; Mrs. Bates; Mrs. Elton,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,Emma
Jane Fairfax,Emma,1318,1320,you are very right it has been thought of and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for,she has had the advantage you know of practising on me like la baronne d almane on la comtesse d ostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan,Emma,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Mrs. Weston,Emma,1369,1371,it is frank and miss fairfax i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning he stays till to morrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us they are coming in i hope,no indeed not in the least i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you and to give you joy in person,Emma; Mr. Woodhouse,F,intermediate,F,major,Emma
Emma,Mr. Frank Churchill,1385,1387,very beautiful indeed,perry my friend mr perry what are they saying about mr perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage such an extraordinary dream of mine i can never think of it without laughing she hears us she hears us miss woodhouse i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown look at her do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye that the whole blunder is spread before her that she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others,Mr. Frank Churchill,F,major,M,major,Emma
Lady Bertram,Sir Thomas,0,2,i think we cannot do better let us send for the child,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting,Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Sir Thomas,Lady Bertram,2,4,there is a great deal of truth in what you say and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each i only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in and that to make it really serviceable to mrs price and creditable to ourselves we must secure to the child or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter as circumstances may arise the provision of a gentlewoman if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine in expecting,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us,Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Norris,Sir Thomas,3,5,i thoroughly understand you you are everything that is generous and considerate and i am sure we shall never disagree on this point whatever i can do as you well know i am always ready enough to do for the good of those i love and though i could never feel for this little girl the hundredth part of the regard i bear your own dear children nor consider her in any respect so much my own i should hate myself if i were capable of neglecting her is not she a sister s child and could i bear to see her want while i had a bit of bread to give her my dear sir thomas with all my faults i have a warm heart and poor as i am would rather deny myself the necessaries of life than do an ungenerous thing so if you are not against it i will write to my poor sister tomorrow and make the proposal and as soon as matters are settled i will engage to get the child to mansfield you shall have no trouble about it my own trouble you know i never regard i will send nanny to london on purpose and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler s and the child be appointed to meet her there they may easily get her from portsmouth to town by the coach under the care of any creditable person that may chance to be going i dare say there is always some reputable tradesman s wife or other going up,yes let her home be in this house we will endeavour to do our duty by her and she will at least have the advantage of companions of her own age and of a regular instructress,Lady Bertram; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Mrs. Norris,4,6,where shall the child come to first sister to you or to us then she had better come to us,very true which are both very important considerations and it will be just the same to miss lee whether she has three girls to teach or only two there can be no difference i only wish i could be more useful but you see i do all in my power i am not one of those that spare their own trouble and nanny shall fetch her however it may put me to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for three days i suppose sister you will put the child in the little white attic near the old nurseries it will be much the best place for her so near miss lee and not far from the girls and close by the housemaids who could either of them help to dress her you know and take care of her clothes for i suppose you would not think it fair to expect ellis to wait on her as well as the others indeed i do not see that you could possibly place her anywhere else i hope she will prove a well disposed girl and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends,Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Sir Thomas,Lady Bertram,7,9,should her disposition be really bad we must not for our own children s sake continue her in the family but there is no reason to expect so great an evil we shall probably see much to wish altered in her and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance some meanness of opinions and very distressing vulgarity of manner but these are not incurable faults nor i trust can they be dangerous for her associates had my daughters been younger than herself i should have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very serious moment but as it is i hope there can be nothing to fear for them and everything to hope for her from the association,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone,Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Norris,Sir Thomas,8,10,that is exactly what i think and what i was saying to my husband this morning it will be an education for the child said i only being with her cousins if miss lee taught her nothing she would learn to be good and clever from them,there will be some difficulty in our way mrs norris as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as they grow up how to preserve in the minds of my daughters the consciousness of what they are without making them think too lowly of their cousin and how without depressing her spirits too far to make her remember that she is not a miss bertram i should wish to see them very good friends and would on no account authorise in my girls the smallest degree of arrogance towards their relation but still they cannot be equals their rank fortune rights and expectations will always be different it is a point of great delicacy and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of conduct,Lady Bertram; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Mrs. Norris,9,11,i hope she will not tease my poor pug i have but just got julia to leave it alone,this is not a very promising beginning after all that i said to her as we came along i thought she would have behaved better i told her how much might depend upon her acquitting herself well at first i wish there may not be a little sulkiness of temper her poor mother had a good deal but we must make allowances for such a child and i do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is really against her for with all its faults it was her home and she cannot as yet understand how much she has changed for the better but then there is moderation in all things,Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
_unknowable,Mrs. Norris,25,27,fanny was good natured enough,my dear it is very bad but you must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself,Edmund; Julia Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mrs. Norris,M,minor,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Norris,Lady Bertram,31,33,to be sure my dear that is very stupid indeed and shows a great want of genius and emulation but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference,so fanny you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it,Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,84,86,my dear sister if you can persuade him into anything of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever and i shall only regret that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a frenchwoman all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have three very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason coax or trick him into marrying is inconceivable he is the most horrible flirt that can be imagined if your miss bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke let them avoid henry,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift,Dr. Grant; Henry Crawford; Mrs. Grant,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Grant,Mary Crawford,85,87,my dear brother i will not believe this of you,there mrs grant you see how he dwells on one word and only look at his smile i assure you he is very detestable the admiral s lessons have quite spoiled him,Dr. Grant; Henry Crawford; Mary Crawford,F,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark
Henry Crawford,Mrs. Grant,86,88,no i am sure you are too good you will be kinder than mary you will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience i am of a cautious temper and unwilling to risk my happiness in a hurry nobody can think more highly of the matrimonial state than myself i consider the blessing of a wife as most justly described in those discreet lines of the poet heaven s last best gift,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person,Dr. Grant; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Grant,Henry Crawford,88,90,i pay very little regard to what any young person says on the subject of marriage if they profess a disinclination for it i only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person,i like your miss bertrams exceedingly sister they are very elegant agreeable girls,Dr. Grant; Henry Crawford; Mary Crawford,F,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Mrs. Grant,89,91,oh yes i am not at all ashamed of it i would have everybody marry if they can do it properly i do not like to have people throw themselves away but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it to advantage,so they are indeed and i am delighted to hear you say it but you like julia best,Dr. Grant; Henry Crawford; Mrs. Grant,F,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,100,102,but miss bertram does not care three straws for him that is your opinion of your intimate friend i do not subscribe to it i am sure miss bertram is very much attached to mr rushworth i could see it in her eyes when he was mentioned i think too well of miss bertram to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart,we must leave him to himself i believe talking does no good he will be taken in at last,Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Tom Bertram,113,115,i believe i know what you mean but i will not undertake to answer the question my cousin is grown up she has the age and sense of a woman but the outs and not outs are beyond me,i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are quizzing me and miss anderson,Mary Crawford; Tom Bertram,M,major,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Edmund,118,120,and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss anderson it is too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong,the error is plain enough such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the beginning they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour before they appear in public than afterwards,Edmund; Tom Bertram,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Tom Bertram,Mary Crawford,119,121,those who are showing the world what female manners should be are doing a great deal to set them right,i do not know yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the modestest part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than anything quite disgusting,Edmund; Mary Crawford,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark

Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,357,359,it is fortunate that your inclination and your father s convenience should accord so well there is a very good living kept for you i understand hereabouts,but that i am sure it has not,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Mary Crawford,360,362,thank you for your good word fanny but it is more than i would affirm myself on the contrary the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me nor can i think it wrong that it should there was no natural disinclination to be overcome and i see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life i was in safe hands i hope i should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way and i am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it i have no doubt that i was biased but i think it was blamelessly,no my dear miss price and for reasons good the profession either navy or army is its own justification it has everything in its favour heroism danger bustle fashion soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Edmund,361,363,it is the same sort of thing as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear,but the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected you think to be justified in your eyes he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,368,370,i speak what appears to me the general opinion and where an opinion is general it is usually correct though i have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Mary Crawford,369,371,where any one body of educated men of whatever denomination are condemned indiscriminately there must be a deficiency of information or smiling of something else your uncle and his brother admirals perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom good or bad they were always wishing away,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Edmund,370,372,poor william he has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the antwerp,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,371,373,i have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle that i can hardly suppose and since you push me so hard i must observe that i am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are being at this present time the guest of my own brother dr grant and though dr grant is most kind and obliging to me and though he is really a gentleman and i dare say a good scholar and clever and often preaches good sermons and is very respectable i see him to be an indolent selfish bon vivant who must have his palate consulted in everything who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one and who moreover if the cook makes a blunder is out of humour with his excellent wife to own the truth henry and i were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose which he could not get the better of my poor sister was forced to stay and bear it,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Mary Crawford,372,374,i do not wonder at your disapprobation upon my word it is a great defect of temper made worse by a very faulty habit of self indulgence and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours fanny it goes against us we cannot attempt to defend dr grant,we cannot prove to the contrary to be sure but i wish you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons for though he may preach himself into a good humour every sunday it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from monday morning till saturday night,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Edmund,373,375,no but we need not give up his profession for all that because whatever profession dr grant had chosen he would have taken a not a good temper into it and as he must either in the navy or army have had a great many more people under his command than he has now i think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman besides i cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in dr grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession where he would have had less time and obligation where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself the frequency at least of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now a man a sensible man like dr grant cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week cannot go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman,i think the man who could often quarrel with fanny must be beyond the reach of any sermons,Edmund; Mary Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,376,378,i fancy miss price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it,here s harmony here s repose here s what may leave all painting and all music behind and what poetry only can attempt to describe here s what may tranquillise every care and lift the heart to rapture when i look out on such a night as this i feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of nature were more attended to and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene,Edmund; Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark

Mr. Rushworth,Edmund,574,576,i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eight or he will be expecting a well looking man if i must say what i think in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we are a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing,we have all been more or less to blame every one of us excepting fanny fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from first to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you you will find fanny everything you could wish,Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mr. Yates; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; Tom Bertram,M,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Sir Thomas,Mrs. Norris,575,577,i am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not feel is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for everybody connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such weight,if i had not been active and made a point of being introduced to his mother and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit i am as certain as i sit here that nothing would have come of it for mr rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we had been idle but i left no stone unturned i was ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister and at last i did persuade her you know the distance to sotherton it was in the middle of winter and the roads almost impassable but i did persuade her,Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mr. Rushworth; Mr. Yates; Mrs. Norris; Tom Bertram,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark

Henry Crawford,Edmund,586,588,i may perhaps get as far as banbury to day,but they have a claim they seem to belong to us they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a twelvemonth when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly the sort of people he would like we are sometimes a little in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would enliven us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father,Dr. Grant; Edmund; Fanny Price; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; Tom Bertram,M,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Tom Bertram,Fanny Price,587,589,whose stables do you use at bath,do you think so in my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he values the very quietness you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be i mean before my uncle went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is any difference it is not more i think than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first there must be a sort of shyness but i cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry except when my uncle was in town no young people s are i suppose when those they look up to are at home,Dr. Grant; Edmund; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Julia Bertram; Lady Bertram; Maria Bertram; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark

Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,614,616,how differently we feel to me the sound of mr bertram is so cold and nothing meaning so entirely without warmth or character it just stands for a gentleman and that s all but there is nobleness in the name of edmund it is a name of heroism and renown of kings princes and knights and seems to breathe the spirit of chivalry and warm affections,well and do you not scold us for our imprudence what do you think we have been sitting down for but to be talked to about it and entreated and supplicated never to do so again,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark

Edmund,Mrs. Grant,619,621,and really the day is so mild that your sitting down for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent our weather must not always be judged by the calendar we may sometimes take greater liberties in november than in may,do not flatter yourself my dearest mary you have not the smallest chance of moving me i have my alarms but they are quite in a different quarter and if i could have altered the weather you would have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time for here are some of my plants which robert will leave out because the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking everybody at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because i know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the fatigues of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like grievances and make me think the weather most unseasonably close,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark

Sir Thomas,Edmund,652,654,she will be late but what is your difficulty,but is it not very natural that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister,Edmund; Lady Bertram,M,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Sir Thomas,653,655,so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her,nothing can be more natural nor were there no sister in the case could anything in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s shewing civility to miss price to lady bertram s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence,Edmund; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,MansfieldPark

Henry Crawford,Mary Crawford,714,716,the farmyard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that side where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the living i suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas,there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not born to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it shall not be from not striving for it,Dr. Grant; Edmund; Fanny Price; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; William Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Henry Crawford,715,717,and i have two or three ideas also and one of them is that very little of your plan for thornton lacey will ever be put in practice i must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty i think the house and premises may be made comfortable and given the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me,my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of excuse me your ladyship must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it bertram you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farmyard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere parsonage house above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a scrambling collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square farmhouse it is a solid roomy mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in have you ever seen the place the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do anything but it is capable of much more let me see mary lady bertram bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady bertram does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to proceed upon my plan though by the bye i doubt anybody s striking out a better you may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modern manners good connexions all this may be stamped on it and that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s house to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to enhance the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours it will certainly be yours,Dr. Grant; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Grant; Mrs. Norris; Sir Thomas; William Price,M,major,M,major,MansfieldPark

Sir Thomas,Fanny Price,745,747,my daughters have their pleasures at brighton and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at mansfield will be for their cousins could we be all assembled our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to debar the others of amusement,when i wear this necklace i shall always think of you and feel how very kind you were,Edmund; Fanny Price; Lady Bertram; Mrs. Norris; William Price,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,748,750,you must think of somebody else too when you wear that necklace you must think of henry for it was his choice in the first place he gave it to me and with the necklace i make over to you all the duty of remembering the original giver it is to be a family remembrancer the sister is not to be in your mind without bringing the brother too my dear child what are you afraid of do you think henry will claim the necklace as mine and fancy you did not come honestly by it or are you imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat an ornament which his money purchased three years ago before he knew there was such a throat in the world or perhaps you suspect a confederacy between us and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire well then to convince me that you suspect no trick and are as unsuspicious of compliment as i have always found you take the necklace and say no more about it its being a gift of my brother s need not make the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure you it makes none in my willingness to part with it he is always giving me something or other i have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite impossible for me to value or for him to remember half and as for this necklace i do not suppose i have worn it six times it is very pretty but i never think of it and though you would be most heartily welcome to any other in my trinket box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words,oh cousin stop a moment pray stop i cannot attempt to thank you thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Mary Crawford,776,778,yes she does look very well chapman helped her to dress i sent chapman to her,perhaps you can tell me why my brother goes to town to morrow he says he has business there but will not tell me what the first time he ever denied me his confidence but this is what we all come to all are supplanted sooner or later now i must apply to you for information pray what is henry going for well then i must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother and of talking of you by the way,Fanny Price; Mary Crawford; Mrs. Norris,F,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark

Lady Bertram,Fanny Price,796,798,and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at sotherton now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there and i am sure she is better off here and besides i cannot do without her,i do not know yes i had not particularly expected it,Fanny Price; Sir Thomas,F,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,814,816,no i do not,my dear henry where can you have been all this time sitting with them an hour and a half,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Mary Crawford,Henry Crawford,838,840,nay henry not by all not forgotten by all not friendless or forgotten her cousin edmund never forgets her,i must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them i will not talk of my own happiness great as it is for i think only of yours compared with you who has a right to be happy i have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known before all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this morning but there has not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the subject i will not attempt to describe how severely mortified how cruelly disappointed in not having it finished while i was in london i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from mansfield but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands i left the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pass before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him i would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of a friend as this day does prove it now i may say that even i could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation than were most voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed together,Henry Crawford,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Mrs. Norris,Henry Crawford,846,848,it is amazing how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they little think how much it comes to or what their parents or their uncles and aunts pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them all together i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what i do for them,have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line,Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram,F,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Fanny Price,847,849,very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little difference to sir thomas fanny william must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for anything else that is worth having i wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two shawls fanny,oh yes certainly i will write directly,Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Mrs. Norris,F,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark
Baddeley,Fanny Price,885,887,no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price,indeed sir i am very sorry that mr crawford should continue to i know that it is paying me a very great compliment and i feel most undeservedly honoured but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told him so that it never will be in my power,Fanny Price; Mrs. Norris,M,minor,F,major,MansfieldPark
Sir Thomas,Fanny Price,888,890,my dear there is no occasion for this your feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing more to be said or done from this hour the subject is never to be revived between us you will have nothing to fear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you to marry against your inclinations your happiness and advantage are all that i have in view and nothing is required of you but to bear with mr crawford s endeavours to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his he proceeds at his own risk you are on safe ground i have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred you will see him with the rest of us in the same manner and as much as you can dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant he leaves northamptonshire so soon that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded the future must be very uncertain and now my dear fanny this subject is closed between us,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that,Fanny Price,M,intermediate,F,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Lady Bertram,890,892,my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps,Lady Bertram,F,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Edmund,892,894,we have not been so silent all the time fanny has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s what s his name fanny when we heard your footsteps,that play must be a favourite with you you read as if you knew it well,Edmund; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford,F,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Lady Bertram,896,898,no doubt one is familiar with shakespeare in a degree from one s earliest years his celebrated passages are quoted by everybody they are in half the books we open and we all talk shakespeare use his similes and describe with his descriptions but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you gave it to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk,Fanny Price; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram,M,major,F,intermediate,MansfieldPark
Lady Bertram,Edmund,898,900,it was really like being at a play i wish sir thomas had been here you have a great turn for acting i am sure mr crawford and i will tell you what i think you will have a theatre some time or other at your house in norfolk i mean when you are settled there i do indeed i think you will fit up a theatre at your house in norfolk,even in my profession how little the art of reading has been studied how little a clear manner and good delivery have been attended to i speak rather of the past however than the present there is now a spirit of improvement abroad but among those who were ordained twenty thirty forty years ago the larger number to judge by their performance must have thought reading was reading and preaching was preaching it is different now the subject is more justly considered it is felt that distinctness and energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths and besides there is more general observation and taste a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly in every congregation there is a larger proportion who know a little of the matter and who can judge and criticise,Edmund; Fanny Price; Henry Crawford,F,intermediate,M,major,MansfieldPark
Fanny Price,Henry Crawford,904,906,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing,what did that shake of the head mean what was it meant to express disapprobation i fear but of what what had i been saying to displease you did you think me speaking improperly lightly irreverently on the subject only tell me if i was only tell me if i was wrong i want to be set right nay nay i entreat you for one moment put down your work what did that shake of the head mean,Edmund; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram,F,major,M,major,MansfieldPark
Henry Crawford,Fanny Price,905,907,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy,how can you sir you quite astonish me i wonder how you can,Edmund; Fanny Price; Lady Bertram,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Edmund,Fanny Price,952,954,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major,MansfieldPark
Sam Price,William Price,968,970,you are just in time we have been looking for you this half hour the thrush went out of harbour this morning i saw her it was a beautiful sight and they think she will have her orders in a day or two and mr campbell was here at four o clock to ask for you he has got one of the thrush s boats and is going off to her at six and hoped you would be here in time to go with him,to be sure i had much rather she had stayed in harbour that i might have sat a few hours with you in comfort but as there is a boat ashore i had better go off at once and there is no help for it whereabouts does the thrush lay at spithead near the canopus but no matter here s fanny in the parlour and why should we stay in the passage come mother you have hardly looked at your own dear fanny yet,Fanny Price; Rebecca; William Price,M,minor,M,minor,MansfieldPark

Catherine Morland,Mrs. Allen,401,403,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself,Mr. Allen; Mrs. Allen,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Mr. Allen,Catherine Morland,404,406,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Allen,M,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Mrs. Allen,Mr. Allen,407,409,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more,Catherine Morland; Mr. Allen,F,intermediate,M,minor,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Mrs. Allen,408,410,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade,that is just what i was going to say,Mr. Allen; Mrs. Allen,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Mrs. Allen,Catherine Morland,410,412,that is just what i was going to say,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france,Catherine Morland; Mr. Allen,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,416,418,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Catherine Morland,418,420,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,422,424,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,423,425,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Henry Tilney,424,426,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,425,427,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,426,428,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,to say the truth i do not much like any other,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Henry Tilney,433,435,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Eleanor Tilney,437,439,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,indeed and of what nature,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,442,444,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,444,446,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit,riot what riot,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Henry Tilney,445,447,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,446,448,riot what riot,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Catherine Morland,456,458,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Maria Thorpe,Catherine Morland,460,462,she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james,Catherine Morland,F,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey

Mrs. Thorpe,Catherine Morland,473,475,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria,shall not you be late at devizes,Catherine Morland; Isabella Thorpe; John Thorpe; Maria Thorpe; Miss Anne,F,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
John Thorpe,Catherine Morland,492,494,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil,Catherine Morland,M,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,523,525,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour,then why did not you,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Isabella Thorpe,527,529,he is very handsome indeed,it is very charming indeed,Isabella Thorpe,F,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Mrs. Thorpe,Catherine Morland,532,534,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford,Catherine Morland; Isabella Thorpe,F,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Mrs. Thorpe,534,536,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection,Isabella Thorpe; Mrs. Thorpe,F,major,F,minor,NorthangerAbbey
Isabella Thorpe,Catherine Morland,535,537,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living,by the end of another week,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Thorpe,F,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Catherine Morland,542,544,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not,Catherine Morland; General Tilney,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Catherine Morland,545,547,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,600,602,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month,but how can that be are not you with her,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Catherine Morland,619,621,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way,how much better is this how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one,Catherine Morland,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,627,629,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction,is it a pretty place,Catherine Morland,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,629,631,is it a pretty place,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day,Eleanor Tilney; General Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Catherine Morland,630,632,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,634,636,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp,Eleanor Tilney; General Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Eleanor Tilney,635,637,he is a happy man but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,minor,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Catherine Morland,636,638,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it her death must have been a great affliction,Catherine Morland; General Tilney,F,intermediate,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Catherine Morland,644,646,our friends from fullerton,it remains as it was i suppose,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Henry Tilney,678,680,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Eleanor Tilney,688,690,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,what was her father,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,693,695,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,695,697,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Eleanor Tilney,Henry Tilney,696,698,such a sister in law henry i should delight in,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,F,intermediate,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,703,705,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,704,706,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves,but he will tell only half of it,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Henry Tilney,706,708,but he will tell only half of it,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days,Henry Tilney,F,major,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Catherine Morland,709,711,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us,go away and why,Catherine Morland; Henry Tilney,M,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,716,718,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
General Tilney,Henry Tilney,721,723,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains,it will soon be as if you never had,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,M,minor,M,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Eleanor Tilney,730,732,it is very right that you should stand by your brother,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long,Eleanor Tilney; Henry Tilney,F,major,F,intermediate,NorthangerAbbey
Henry Tilney,Catherine Morland,731,733,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again,Catherine Morland; Eleanor Tilney,M,major,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Sarah,Mrs. Morland,753,755,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping,Catherine Morland; Mrs. Morland,F,minor,F,minor,NorthangerAbbey
Mrs. Morland,Catherine Morland,754,756,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor,Catherine Morland; Sarah,F,minor,F,major,NorthangerAbbey
Catherine Morland,Mrs. Morland,756,758,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself,Mrs. Morland,F,major,F,minor,NorthangerAbbey

Mr Shepherd,Mrs Clay,6,8,i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,F,minor,Persuasion
Mrs Clay,Mr Shepherd,8,10,they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected,in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Sir Walter Elliot,F,minor,M,minor,Persuasion
Sir Walter Elliot,Anne Elliot,9,11,as to all that supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier,the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Mrs Clay,M,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion
Mr Shepherd,Sir Walter Elliot,12,14,very true very true what miss anne says is very true,the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,M,intermediate,Persuasion
Mrs Clay,Anne Elliot,17,19,nay sir walter this is being severe indeed have a little mercy on the poor men we are not all born to be handsome the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural effect of time the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman and even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Sir Walter Elliot,F,minor,F,major,Persuasion
Anne Elliot,Mr Shepherd,19,21,he is a rear admiral of the white he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years,and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford bless me what was his name at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs croft s brother,Mr Shepherd; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,F,major,M,minor,Persuasion
Sir Walter Elliot,Mrs Clay,20,22,then i take it for granted that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Mrs Clay,M,intermediate,F,minor,Persuasion
Mrs Clay,Anne Elliot,22,24,i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent,you mean mr wentworth i suppose,Anne Elliot; Mr Shepherd; Sir Walter Elliot,F,minor,F,major,Persuasion
Anne Elliot,Sir Walter Elliot,24,26,you mean mr wentworth i suppose,wentworth oh ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford you misled me by the term gentleman i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common,Mr Shepherd; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,F,major,M,intermediate,Persuasion
Mr Shepherd,Anne Elliot,25,27,wentworth was the very name mr wentworth was the very man he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years came there about the year 5 i take it you remember him i am sure,a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,F,major,Persuasion
Mary,Elizabeth,29,31,i cannot possibly do without anne,mrs clay never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times that tooth of her s and those freckles freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles,Elizabeth,,,F,minor,Persuasion
Elizabeth,Anne Elliot,33,35,i think very differently an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me,i am sorry to find you unwell you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday,Anne Elliot,F,minor,F,major,Persuasion
Louisa Musgrove,Mary,63,65,and i will tell you our reason and all about it i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte i will tell you why she is out of spirits when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things,oh no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away only think if anything should happen,Mary,F,minor,,,Persuasion

William Walter Elliot,Sir Walter Elliot,206,208,the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view,my dear madam this must not be as yet you have seen nothing of bath you have been here only to be useful you must not run away from us now you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification,Anne Elliot; Elizabeth; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,M,minor,M,intermediate,Persuasion

Lady Russell,William Walter Elliot,215,217,it was an acquaintance worth having,you are mistaken that is not good company that is the best good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well my cousin anne shakes her head she is not satisfied she is fastidious my dear cousin you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer will it make you happy will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for,Anne Elliot; William Walter Elliot,F,minor,M,minor,Persuasion
William Walter Elliot,Anne Elliot,221,223,i love your indignation it is very natural but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different in one point i am sure my dear cousin in one point i am sure we must feel alike we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him,i can easily believe it women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes,Anne Elliot; Lady Russell,M,minor,F,major,Persuasion
Mrs Smith,Anne Elliot,224,226,yes sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now,no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged,Anne Elliot,F,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion

Elizabeth,Sir Walter Elliot,227,229,but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance,westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland mrs smith such a name,Anne Elliot; Mrs Clay; Sir Walter Elliot,F,minor,M,intermediate,Persuasion

Captain Wentworth,Anne Elliot,270,272,indeed i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust,this is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language i am a very poor italian scholar,Anne Elliot,M,major,F,major,Persuasion

Sir Walter Elliot,Anne Elliot,357,359,and mine kindest regards and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon make a civil message but i shall only leave my card morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately,i am extremely glad indeed particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both,Anne Elliot; Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,Persuasion

Anne Elliot,Captain Harville,399,401,your feelings may be the strongest but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship your home country friends all quitted neither time nor health nor life to be called your own it would be hard indeed if woman s feelings were to be added to all this,have you finished your letter,Captain Harville,F,major,M,intermediate,Persuasion

A Young Lucas,Charlotte Lucas,84,86,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,minor,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Elizabeth,85,87,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice

Elizabeth,Mr. Bingley,255,257,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,258,260,i see your design bingley you dislike an argument and want to silence this,what you ask is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bingley,Mr. Darcy,259,261,perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me,do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Miss Bingley,Mr. Darcy,268,270,i did not know that you intended to walk,this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue,Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Hurst,Elizabeth,269,271,you used us abominably ill in running away without telling us that you were coming out,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy,F,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Miss Bingley,271,273,no no stay where you are you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye,how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure,Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Hurst,Mr. Bingley,272,274,very glad,if you mean darcy he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,M,minor,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bingley,Elizabeth,276,278,much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Miss Bingley,Mr. Darcy,277,279,miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire,Elizabeth; Jane; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Miss Bingley,278,280,not at all but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it,oh shocking i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech,Miss Bingley,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,279,281,i have not the smallest objection to explaining them you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire,nothing so easy if you have but the inclination we can all plague and punish one another teaze him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Miss Bingley,Mr. Darcy,282,284,but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself,miss bingley has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke,Elizabeth; Jane; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Miss Bingley,287,289,such as vanity and pride,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result,Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,288,290,yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation,i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise,Elizabeth; Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Miss Bingley,Mr. Darcy,289,291,your examination of mr darcy is over i presume and pray what is the result,no i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever,Elizabeth; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Miss Bingley,294,296,and your defect is a propensity to hate every body,do let us have a little music louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst,Jane; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Jane,305,307,why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear there mrs bennet at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Elizabeth,306,308,there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Bennet,F,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Jane,Mr. Bennet,307,309,though it is difficult to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Bennet; Mrs. Bennet,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mary,308,310,he must be an oddity i think i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir,in point of composition his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed,Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Bennet; Mrs. Bennet,F,major,F,minor,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,309,311,no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him,you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Bennet,321,323,has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Bennet; Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Lydia,323,325,you judge very properly and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Lydia,Mrs. Bennet,325,327,do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town,as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged,Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Mary; Mr. Bennet; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennet,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,George Wickham,328,330,i know little of the game at present but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life,yes his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy,Elizabeth; George Wickham; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Philips; Mrs. Philips,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
George Wickham,Elizabeth,360,362,probably not but mr darcy can please where he chuses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure,lady catherine de bourgh has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,George Wickham,361,363,i know very well madam that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters,you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy,Elizabeth; George Wickham; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Philips,M,intermediate,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
George Wickham,Elizabeth,367,369,i believe her to be both in a great degree i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class,very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Denney,Elizabeth,376,378,i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here,heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil,Elizabeth; Lydia,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Charlotte Lucas,Elizabeth,377,379,i dare say you will find him very agreeable,it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,387,389,he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life,sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of,Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Sir William Lucas,Elizabeth,388,390,i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me,i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine,Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,M,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,407,409,i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself,Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Miss Bingley,Elizabeth,410,412,i beg your pardon excuse my interference it was kindly meant,i want to know what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,420,422,you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him,Charlotte Lucas; Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,422,424,i have no reason i assure you to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him,for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Lydia,Mrs. Bennet,427,429,lord how tired i am,oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs,Elizabeth; Kitty; Mary; Mr. Bennet; Mr. Collins; Mr. Darcy; Mrs. Bennet,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,428,430,may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself,Elizabeth; Kitty; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,430,432,dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself,believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married,Kitty; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennet,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Elizabeth,431,433,no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins,you are too hasty sir you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without farther loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them,Elizabeth; Kitty; Mr. Collins,F,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,Mrs. Bennet,444,446,pardon me for interrupting you madam but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity,oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her,Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Bennet,450,452,speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him,come here child i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true very well and this offer of marriage you have refused,Mr. Bennet,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mrs. Bennet,453,455,i have sir,yes or i will never see her again,Mr. Bennet; Mrs. Bennet,F,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Mrs. Bennet,458,460,my dear i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be,pray do my dear miss lucas for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves,Elizabeth; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Mr. Collins,462,464,now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together,my dear madam let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
George Wickham,Elizabeth,465,467,i found as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself,it is unlucky that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Elizabeth,485,487,you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence,engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mr. Collins; Mrs. Bennet,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Jane,Elizabeth,513,515,beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood,thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mrs. Bennet,Elizabeth,517,519,i do not blame jane for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves,an excellent consolation in its way but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before,Elizabeth; Kitty; Lydia; Mary; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Charlotte Lucas,Elizabeth,539,541,i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford my father and maria are to come to me in march and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them,pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary,Elizabeth,F,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice

Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,556,558,very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference,and is this all i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Maria,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,565,567,do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved,a little,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Charlotte Lucas,586,588,you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age,i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Maria; Miss De Bourgh; Mrs. Jenkinson,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice

Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,593,595,i assure you madam that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly,you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me,Charlotte Lucas; Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth; Lady Catherine De Bourgh,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Mr. Darcy,594,596,so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house,i shall not say that you are mistaken because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own,Charlotte Lucas; Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Colonel Fitzwilliam,597,599,your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,598,600,i am not afraid of you,you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Colonel Fitzwilliam,Mr. Darcy,599,601,pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of i should like to know how he behaves among strangers,i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party,Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,M,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Colonel Fitzwilliam,603,605,perhaps i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,604,606,shall we ask your cousin the reason of this shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers,i certainly have not the talent which some people possess of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Mr. Darcy,F,major,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Colonel Fitzwilliam,Elizabeth,605,607,i can answer your question without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble,my fingers do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution,Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Darcy,Elizabeth,608,610,you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers,how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth,M,major,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Lady Catherine De Bourgh,Mr. Darcy,609,611,miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn,perfectly so i thank you,Colonel Fitzwilliam; Elizabeth; Mr. Darcy,F,intermediate,M,major,PrideAndPrejudice

Colonel Fitzwilliam,Elizabeth,636,638,our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money,and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Elizabeth,Mr. Collins,678,680,my uncle is to send a servant for us,i know not miss elizabeth whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other,Anne De Bourgh; Charlotte Lucas; Lady Catherine De Bourgh; Mr. Collins,F,major,M,intermediate,PrideAndPrejudice

Kitty,Elizabeth,730,732,i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older,if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair,Elizabeth; Jane,F,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice
Mr. Bennet,Elizabeth,735,737,do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life,nearly three weeks,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice

Mrs. Reynolds,Elizabeth,774,776,and this is always the way with him whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her,what will be his surprise when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,minor,F,major,PrideAndPrejudice

Mrs. Gardiner,Mr. Gardiner,801,803,that is all settled,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,M,minor,PrideAndPrejudice

Mrs. Dashwood,Edward Ferrars,268,270,i should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself if my children were all to be rich without my help,what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london in such an event what a happy day for booksellers music sellers and print shops you miss dashwood would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for marianne i know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough in london to content her and books thomson cowper scott she would buy them all over and over again she would buy up every copy i believe to prevent their falling into unworthy hands and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree should not you marianne forgive me if i am very saucy but i was willing to show you that i had not forgot our old disputes,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Margaret; Marianne,F,intermediate,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Elinor,Edward Ferrars,298,300,i suspect that to avoid one kind of affectation edward here falls into another because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel and is disgusted with such pretensions he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own,i am convinced that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel but in return your sister must allow me to feel no more than i profess i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees i admire them much more if they are tall straight and flourishing i do not like ruined tattered cottages i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms i have more pleasure in a snug farm house than a watch tower and a troop of tidy happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world,Edward Ferrars; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Anne Steele,Elinor,460,462,oh i dare say lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as miss dashwood s,i should always be happy to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary he is brother to mrs john dashwood that must be recommendation enough to her husband,Elinor; Lady Middleton; Lucy Steele; Marianne; Mrs. Jennings,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
John Middleton,Marianne,475,477,i have a notion that miss marianne would not object to such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it it is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood does not wish it so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle,Elinor; Marianne; Mrs. Jennings,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Elinor,477,479,i thank you ma am sincerely thank you your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever and it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest happiness i am capable of to be able to accept it but my mother my dearest kindest mother i feel the justice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence oh no nothing should tempt me to leave her it should not must not be a struggle,though with your usual anxiety for our happiness you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion cannot be so easily removed,Elinor; John Middleton; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Marianne,481,483,my objection is this though i think very well of mrs jennings s heart she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure or whose protection will give us consequence,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Elinor,483,485,if elinor is frightened away by her dislike of mrs jennings at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,484,486,i will have you both go these objections are nonsensical you will have much pleasure in being in london and especially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family,i am writing home marianne had not you better defer your letter for a day or two,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Marianne,485,487,i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not,i am not going to write to my mother oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Charlotte,Elinor,494,496,mr palmer will be so happy to see you what do you think he said when he heard of your coming with mama i forget what it was now but it was something so droll,how odd indeed if she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to combe magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write oh my dear mother you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young a man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful so mysterious a manner i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,497,499,if this open weather holds much longer sir john will not like leaving barton next week tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure poor souls i always pity them when they do they seem to take it so much to heart,at any rate i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Mrs. Jennings,498,500,that is true i had not thought of that this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country it is charming weather for them indeed how much they must enjoy it but it cannot be expected to last long at this time of the year and after such a series of rain we shall certainly have very little more of it frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity in another day or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay perhaps it may freeze tonight,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way,Elinor; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Jennings,Marianne,500,502,ay my dear i ll warrant you we do mary always has her own way,don t you find it colder than it was in the morning elinor there seems to me a very decided difference i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff it was not so yesterday i think the clouds seem parting too the sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a clear afternoon good god he has been here while we were out,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility

Colonel Brandon,Elinor,524,526,by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sister s writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,pray pray be composed and do not betray what you feel to every body present perhaps he has not observed you yet,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility

Marianne,Elinor,533,535,no elinor ask nothing you will soon know all,and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby i thought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems to imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceive yourself any longer i do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,571,573,how do you do my dear how is she miss dashwood poor thing she looks very bad no wonder ay it is but too true he is to be married very soon a good for nothing fellow i have no patience with him mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was said i and so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it i have no notion of men s going on in this way and if ever i meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day but there is one comfort my dear miss marianne he is not the only young man in the world worth having and with your pretty face you will never want admirers well poor thing i won t disturb her any longer for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with the parrys and sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her,the lady then miss grey i think you called her is very rich,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility

Marianne,Elinor,607,609,i will not trust to that a man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others,i understand you you have something to tell me of mr willoughby that will open his character farther your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown marianne my gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end and hers must be gained by it in time pray pray let me hear it,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Lucy Steele,Anne Steele,624,626,i should have been quite disappointed if i had not found you here still but i always thought i should i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month but i thought at the time that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point it would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came and now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word,not in the stage i assure you we came post all the way and had a very smart beau to attend us dr davies was coming to town and so we thought we d join him in a post chaise and he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did,Anne Steele; Elinor; Mrs. Jennings,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Mrs. Jennings,Lucy Steele,675,677,ah poor dear,my dear friend i come to talk to you of my happiness could anything be so flattering as mrs ferrars s way of treating me yesterday so exceeding affable as she was you know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her but the very moment i was introduced there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say she had quite took a fancy to me now was not it so you saw it all and was not you quite struck with it,Anne Steele; Colonel Brandon; Elinor; Fanny; John Dashwood; John Middleton; Lady Middleton; Lucy Steele; Marianne; Mrs. Ferrars,F,intermediate,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Lucy Steele,Marianne,689,691,perhaps miss marianne you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have no mind to keep them little as well as great,what can bring her here so often could not she see that we wanted her gone how teazing to edward,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Elinor,690,692,not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street and i really believe he has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous in performing every engagement however minute and however it may make against his interest or pleasure he is the most fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfish of any body i ever saw edward it is so and i will say it what are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation going so soon my dear edward this must not be,why so we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest known to him of any it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves,Edward Ferrars; Elinor; Lucy Steele,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,702,704,that is exactly what i said my dear says i so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this mr edward ferrars the very young man i used to joke with you about but however as it turns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin lucy there s for you my dear and not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter except nancy could you have believed such a thing possible there is no great wonder in their liking one another but that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobody suspect it that is strange i never happened to see them together or i am sure i should have found it out directly well and so this was kept a great secret for fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter till this very morning poor nancy who you know is a well meaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out thinks she to herself and so away she went to your sister who was sitting all alone at her carpet work little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother only five minutes before that she thought to make a match between edward and some lord s daughter or other i forget who so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams as reached your brother s ears as he was sitting in his own dressing room down stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place for lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on poor soul i pity her and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit nancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly and your brother he walked about the room and said he did not know what to do mrs dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes then she fell into hysterics again and he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan and mr donavan found the house in all this uproar the carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away and they were just stepping in as he came off poor lucy in such a condition he says she could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her lord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he hears of it to have his love used so scornfully for they say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same he and i had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is that he is gone back again to harley street that he may be within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too and so she may for what i care i have no pity for either of them i have no notion of people s making such a to do about money and greatness there is no reason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry for i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well by her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only allow him five hundred a year she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight lord how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids and two men and i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my betty has a sister out of place that would fit them exactly,i have known it these four months when lucy first came to barton park last november she told me in confidence of her engagement,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Marianne,712,714,i understand you you do not suppose that i have ever felt much for four months marianne i have had all this hanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least it was told me it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me as i thought with triumph this person s suspicions therefore i have had to oppose by endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most deeply interested and it has not been only once i have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again i have known myself to be divided from edward for ever without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection nothing has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to me i have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages and all this has been going on at a time when as you know too well it has not been my only unhappiness if you can think me capable of ever feeling surely you may suppose that i have suffered now the composure of mind with which i have brought myself at present to consider the matter the consolation that i have been willing to admit have been the effect of constant and painful exertion they did not spring up of themselves they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first no marianne then if i had not been bound to silence perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what i owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that i was very unhappy,yes ma am,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Mrs. Jennings,716,718,gracious god can this be possible,then he has acted like an honest man i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had done otherwise i should have thought him a rascal i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband,Elinor; John Dashwood; Mrs. Jennings,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Colonel Brandon,Elinor,752,754,this little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars comfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry i am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive if however by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther i must think very differently of him from what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful to him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present what i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal his only object of happiness his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon,thank you ma am it is a matter of great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel brandon most sensibly there are not many men who would act as he has done few people who have so compassionate a heart i never was more astonished in my life,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Jennings,Elinor,789,791,the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less take my word for it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shan t go if lucy an t there,it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
John Dashwood,Elinor,804,806,certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other of one thing my dear sister i may assure you and i will do it because i know it must gratify you i have good reason to think indeed i have it from the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it but i have it from the very best authority not that i ever precisely heard mrs ferrars say it herself but her daughter did and i have it from her that in short whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection you understand me it would have been far preferable to her it would not have given her half the vexation that this does i was exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all she said and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse but however all that is quite out of the question not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know it never could be all that is gone by but i thought i would just tell you of this because i knew how much it must please you not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor there is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well quite as well or better perhaps all things considered has colonel brandon been with you lately,have you ever seen the lady,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Robert Ferrars,Elinor,807,809,yes once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly just the kind of girl i should suppose likely to captivate poor edward i offered immediately as soon as my mother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade him from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place when it was not for me you know to interfere but had i been informed of it a few hours earlier i think it is most probable that something might have been hit on i certainly should have represented it to edward in a very strong light my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing you are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot help thinking in short that means might have been found but now it is all too late he must be starved you know that is certain absolutely starved,not yet but she will be here i hope before it is long it is a great way you know from hence to barton,Elinor,M,minor,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Elinor,810,812,but she must not go round by london i shall never see her if she goes by london,no sir i shall not stay your business cannot be with me the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house,Elinor,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mr. Willoughby,Elinor,869,871,but she will be gained by some one else and if that some one should be the very he whom of all others i could least bear but i will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill by showing that where i have most injured i can least forgive good bye god bless you,colonel brandon s character as an excellent man is well established,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,876,878,no he thinks marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time and even supposing her heart again free is too diffident of himself to believe that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her there however he is quite mistaken his age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage as to make his character and principles fixed and his disposition i am well convinced is exactly the very one to make your sister happy and his person his manners too are all in his favour my partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so handsome as willoughby but at the same time there is something much more pleasing in his countenance there was always a something if you remember in willoughby s eyes at times which i did not like and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne their gentleness their genuine attention to other people and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition than the liveliness often artificial and often ill timed of the other i am very sure myself that had willoughby turned out as really amiable as he has proved himself the contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with colonel brandon at delaford she will be within an easy distance of me even if i remain at barton and in all probability for i hear it is a large village indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by that would suit us quite as well as our present situation his fortune too for at my time of life you know everybody cares about that and though i neither know nor desire to know what it really is i am sure it must be a good one,if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Marianne,884,886,our situations have borne little resemblance,i wish to assure you both that i see every thing as you can desire me to do it is a great relief to me what elinor told me this morning i have now heard exactly what i wished to hear i am now perfectly satisfied i wish for no change i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem nothing could have done it away to my feelings,Marianne,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,887,889,i know it i know it happy with a man of libertine practices with one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men no my marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man her conscience her sensitive conscience would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt,you consider the matter exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain had you married you must have been always poor his expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares that self denial is a word hardly understood by him his demands and your inexperience together on a small very small income must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before your sense of honour and honesty would have led you i know when aware of your situation to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and perhaps as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort you might have been suffered to practice it but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage beyond that had you endeavoured however reasonably to abridge his enjoyments is it not to be feared that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it you would have lessened your own influence on his heart and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties,Elinor; Marianne,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,893,895,at present he regrets what he has done and why does he regret it because he finds it has not answered towards himself it has not made him happy his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself but does it follow that had he married you he would have been happy the inconveniences would have been different he would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which because they are removed he now reckons as nothing he would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint but he would have been always necessitous always poor and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance even to domestic happiness than the mere temper of a wife,rather say your mother s imprudence my child she must be answerable,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility
Marianne,Elinor,894,896,i have not a doubt of it and i have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents,Elinor; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Mrs. Dashwood,896,898,one observation may i think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to eliza williams that crime has been the origin of every lesser one and of all his present discontents,who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas,Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,F,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility

Mrs. Dashwood,Elinor,915,917,i wrote to him my love last week and rather expect to see than to hear from him again i earnestly pressed his coming to us and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day,is mrs ferrars at longstaple,Elinor,F,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Edward Ferrars,919,921,i meant to enquire for mrs edward ferrars,it was a foolish idle inclination on my side the consequence of ignorance of the world and want of employment had my mother given me some active profession when i was removed at eighteen from the care of mr pratt i think nay i am sure it would never have happened for though i left longstaple with what i thought at the time a most unconquerable preference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months i should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing more with the world as in such case i must have done but instead of having any thing to do instead of having any profession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself i returned home to be completely idle and for the first twelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment which belonging to the university would have given me for i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen i had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable as i had no friend no companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance it was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple where i always felt myself at home and was always sure of a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects considering everything therefore i hope foolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since in every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly that was exactly like robert and that might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began and lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour other designs might afterward arise i will not ask your opinion of it as a composition for worlds would not i have had a letter of hers seen by you in former days in a sister it is bad enough but in a wife how i have blushed over the pages of her writing and i believe i may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter i ever received from her of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style,Edward Ferrars; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,920,922,perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars perhaps you do not know you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to miss lucy steele yes they were married last week and are now at dawlish,however it may have come about they are certainly married and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment the independence she settled on robert through resentment against you has put it in his power to make his own choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a year to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,Elinor; Margaret; Marianne; Mrs. Dashwood,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Elinor,Edward Ferrars,924,926,no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour that your own family might in time relent and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions the connection was certainly a respectable one and probably gained her consideration among her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it would be better for her to marry you than be single your behaviour was certainly very wrong because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you were then situated could never be,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,Edward Ferrars,F,major,M,intermediate,SenseAndSensibility
Edward Ferrars,Elinor,925,927,i was simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted to another there could be no danger in my being with you and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour i felt that i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship and till i began to make comparisons between yourself and lucy i did not know how far i was got after that i suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better than these the danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself which at present after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering,you may certainly ask to be forgiven because you have offended and i should think you might now venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger and when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first,Elinor,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
Edward Ferrars,Marianne,926,928,a letter of proper submission would they have me beg my mother s pardon for robert s ingratitude to her and breach of honour to me i can make no submission i am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed i am grown very happy but that would not interest i know of no submission that is proper for me to make,and if they really do interest themselves in bringing about a reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirely without merit,Elinor; Marianne,M,intermediate,F,major,SenseAndSensibility
