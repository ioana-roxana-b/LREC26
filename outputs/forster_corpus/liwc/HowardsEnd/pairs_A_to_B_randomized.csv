Margaret,Aunt Juley,22,21,i shall ask no questions i have it in helen s writing that she and a man are in love there is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that all the rest isn t worth a straw a long engagement if you like but inquiries questions plans lines of action no aunt juley no if helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk,i do understand i go down in no spirit of interference but to make inquiries inquiries are necessary now i am going to be rude you would say the wrong thing to a certainty you would in your anxiety for helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions not that one minds offending them,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,24,327,or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for carter paterson i should have said the same though in the case of carter paterson i should want it to be a very long engagement indeed i must say,there they go there goes fraulein mosebach really for a german she does dress charmingly oh,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,26,17,but you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off,on the contrary,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,28,25,can you break an engagement off slowly what s an engagement made of do you suppose i think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap but can t break it is different to the other ties of life they stretch or bend they admit of degree they re different,i should think so and indeed i can scarcely follow you now just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the wilcoxes i understand it but most good people would think you mad imagine how disconcerting for helen what is wanted is a person who will go slowly slowly in this business and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,30,317,yes i have changed my mind i do wish that you would go you will remember aunt juley not to be drawn into discussing the engagement give my letter to helen and say whatever you feel yourself but do keep clear of the relatives we have scarcely got their names straight yet and besides that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong,oh margaret most dangerous,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Aunt Juley,131,13,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god,but go with some plan margaret if i may interfere don t be taken by surprise what do you think of the wilcoxes are they our sort are they likely people could they appreciate helen who is to my mind a very special sort of person do they care about literature and art that is most important when you come to think of it literature and art most important how old would the son be she says younger son would he be in a position to marry is he likely to make helen happy did you gather,Aunt Juley; Uncle Ernst,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,195,313,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil,why,Aunt Juley; Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,282,335,oh but helen isn t a girl with no interests she has plenty of other things and other people to think about she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them,for riches,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,284,307,of course she must bow but look here let s do the flowers i was going to say the will to be interested in him has died and what else matters i look on that disastrous episode over which you were so kind as the killing of a nerve in helen it s dead and she ll never be troubled with it again the only things that matter are the things that interest one bowing even calling and leaving cards even a dinner party we can do all those things to the wilcoxes if they find it agreeable but the other thing the one important thing never again don t you see i also have the honour to inform you that the wilcoxes are bored with us i didn t tell you at the time it might have made you angry and you had enough to worry you but i wrote a letter to mrs w and apologised for the trouble that helen had given them she didn t answer it,she minds i knew she d mind and i m sure a girl ought to such an experience such awful coarse grained people i know more about them than you do which you forget and if charles had taken you that motor drive well you d have reached the house a perfect wreck oh margaret you don t know what you are in for they re all bottled up against the drawing room window there s mrs wilcox i ve seen her there s paul there s evie who is a minx there s charles i saw him to start with and who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper coloured face be,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,286,1055,i wonder or was it sensible,but you won t do anything rash margaret,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,288,31,in either case one can class it as reassuring,so uncivilised,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,290,309,oh certainly fiendishly careful,i knew it and there s mr wilcox,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,299,1824,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack,but she is not really interesting if only you had helen,Aunt Juley; Fraulein Mosebach; Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,306,15,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome,then in that case,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,308,283,mr wilcox possibly,for a clever girl dear how very oddly you do talk helen ll have to have something more to do with them now that they re all opposite she may meet that paul in the street she cannot very well not bow,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,310,1826,it s a shame to call his face copper colour he has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age helen did not take the news quite as i expected but the wilcox nerve is dead in her really so there s no need for plans,no but he has to do his chinese some real companion is what you need really helen is odd,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,312,7,no it s as well not to be prepared,i still feel quite uneasy about this business margaret,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,314,289,because because i d sooner risk it,but you will be careful won t you,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,316,1339,i hope to risk things all my life,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,318,9,but after all there s never any great risk as long as you have money,the germans are too thorough and this is all very well sometimes but at other times it does not do,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,320,33,money pads the edges of things god help those who have none,only with helen,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,322,1820,new for me sensible people have acknowledged it for years you and i and the wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands it is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence it s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means last night when we were talking up here round the fire i began to think that the very soul of the world is economic and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love but the absence of coin,how very odd of helen mr wilcox,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,324,29,so do i but helen and i we ought to remember when we are tempted to criticise others that we are standing on these islands and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea the poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer we rich can imagine the tragedy last june if helen and paul wilcox had been poor people and couldn t invoke railways and motor cars to part them,exactly so but won t you let me just run down to howards house and save you all the discomfort i will really not interfere but i do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,326,1828,call it what you like i call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table i m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves i stand each year upon six hundred pounds and helen upon the same and tibby will stand upon eight and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed from the sea yes from the sea and all our thoughts are the thoughts of six hundred pounders and all our speeches and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes and that what s a joke up here is down there reality,not content with going abroad why does she want to go back there at once,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Aunt Juley,328,300,what is it,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees,Aunt Juley,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Aunt Juley,1064,196,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating,i remember something of the sort now,Aunt Juley; Helen; Tibby,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,1181,1986,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you,not all the books she hasn t unpacked the art books in which she may show her sense and we never used to have the sword here,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,1183,775,i don t intend him or any man or any woman to be all my life good heavens no there are heaps of things in me that he doesn t and shall never understand so with him there are heaps of things in him more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me he has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this if wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in england for thousands of years you and i couldn t sit here without having our throats cut there would be no trains no ships to carry us literary people about in no fields even just savagery no perhaps not even that without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm more and more do i refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it there are times when it seems to me,no,Helen,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,1335,123,why should you put things so bitterly dearie,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that,Helen,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,1509,2054,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better,i know he won t like it but i am going to pass out of their lives what difference will it make in the long run if they say and she even spent the night at howards end,Helen,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,2142,2284,i need never have written them they never shielded henry how hopeless it is to tidy away the past even for others,i hope it will be permanent,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2144,688,looking back that was wrong of me,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do cheers children it s mrs lanoline,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2146,1162,leonard is a better growth than madness i was afraid that you would react against paul until you went over the verge,but it s stupid,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2148,117,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2152,795,oh good night miss avery,walking at night,Helen; Miss Avery,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,2158,2267,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2160,2046,are you serious in asking me helen should i get on with your monica,drink some milk to steady you no i won t tell you yet because you may laugh or be angry let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing then one would see really about my idea couldn t you and i camp out in this house for the night,Helen,F,major,F,major

Margaret,Helen,2250,2012,that child is a wonderful nursemaid,i know no i don t what a detestable boy tibby was,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2252,1485,starting at the ages of six and one,i knew it was our last chance,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2254,2066,it may be a greater thing for baby,go if you like i should have stopped without leave,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2256,672,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while,what i say i was as it were orating my speech annie opens the door like a fool and shows a female straight in on me with my mouth open then we began very civilly no how unjust one is she said whom not what she got it perfectly so i said and she said and there we were,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2258,985,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing,yes it s all right meg poor poor creature,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2260,779,dreadfully that is why i wish dolly had not come too to day still he wanted them all to come it has to be,well,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2262,2286,you d be odd if you didn t,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2264,1494,usen t,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2266,1186,and he likes you because you don t,it makes no difference thinking things out they come to the same,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2268,799,i do not agree i do not,for you,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2273,1950,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him,yes i might have but decided to wait,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2275,1475,perhaps an adventure,he has lost his place he has been turned out of his bank yes he s done for we upper classes have ruined him and i suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life starving his wife is ill starving she fainted in the train,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2277,1160,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet,it s not a thing like that,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2279,218,it will sweeten to morrow,if you smoked too the house might suddenly turn masculine atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go even at queen victoria s dinner party if something had been just a little different perhaps if she d worn a clinging liberty tea gown instead of a magenta satin,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2281,1307,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter,but i think you told us the porphyrion was bad and would smash before christmas,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2283,873,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2285,1956,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own,she has been extraordinarily sensible with me you must not think that we shall never meet i shall always have a room for you when you can be spared and the longer you can be with me the better but you haven t understood yet meg and of course it is very difficult for you this is a shock to you it isn t to me who have been thinking over our futures for many months and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps such as this i cannot live in england,Helen,F,major,F,major
Margaret,Helen,2287,1481,oh take care,kindly take back that word hangers on,Helen,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,113,790,it was over at once,helen come to bed,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,115,1969,i was still happy while i dressed but as i came downstairs i got nervous and when i went into the dining room i knew it was no good there was evie i can t explain managing the tea urn and mr wilcox reading the times,there s nothing to tell,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,117,683,yes and charles was talking to him about stocks and shares and he looked frightened somehow when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful it is all right for us to be frightened or for men of another sort father for instance but for men like that when i saw all the others so placid and paul mad with terror in case i said the wrong thing i felt for a moment that the whole wilcox family was a fraud just a wall of newspapers and motor cars and golf clubs and that if it fell i should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness,her husband may be though,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,119,2015,no i don t really think that but paul was so broad shouldered all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse and i knew that it would never do never i said to him after breakfast when the others were practising strokes and he looked better at once though frightfully ashamed he began a speech about having no money to marry on but it hurt him to make it and i stopped him then he said and i said and then we parted at least until i remembered that i had written straight off to tell you the night before and that frightened him again i asked him to send a telegram for me for he knew you would be coming or something and he tried to get hold of the motor but charles and mr wilcox wanted it to go to the station and charles offered to send the telegram for me and then i had to say that the telegram was of no consequence for paul said charles might read it and though i wrote it out several times he always said people would suspect something he took it himself at last pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges and what with one thing and the other it was not handed in at the post office until too late it was the most terrible morning paul disliked me more and more and evie talked cricket averages till i nearly screamed i cannot think how i stood her all the other days at last charles and his father started for the station and then came your telegram warning me that aunt juley was coming by that train and paul oh rather horrible said that i had muddled it but mrs wilcox knew,i have got it that every morning for three weeks no wonder tibby was wild,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,121,221,everything though we neither of us told her a word and she had known all along i think,how inconceivable it would be if the royal family cared about art,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,123,1480,i suppose so but it seemed wonderful when charles and aunt juley drove up calling each other names mrs wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible ugh but it has been a disgusting business to think that,don t be absurd they aren t starving and you know it now begin from the beginning i won t have such theatrical nonsense how dare you yes how dare you bursting in to evie s wedding in this heartless way my goodness but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy look servants people out of the windows they think it s some vulgar scandal and i must explain oh no it s only my sister screaming and only two hangers on of ours whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,125,2162,oh meg that s what i felt only not so clearly when the wilcoxes were so competent and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes,still no more plans now and no more reminiscences sleep now,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,127,796,i remember paul at breakfast i shall never forget him he had nothing to fall back upon i know that personal relations are the real life for ever and ever,probably,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,183,2053,all right,i feel charles wouldn t like it even our furniture annoyed him and i was going to clear it out when aunt juley s illness prevented me i sympathise with charles he feels it s his mother s house he loves it in rather an untaking way henry i could answer for not charles,Aunt Juley; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,190,2256,whatever have i done,it has to be the hay fever is his chief objection against living here but he thinks it worth while,Aunt Juley; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,296,1181,of course i don t mind it is that you and meg are both so absurdly grave about it when there s nothing to be grave about at all,that s foolish in the first place i disagree about the outer life well we ve often argued that the real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love making and yours yours was romance mine will be prose i m not running it down a very good kind of prose but well considered well thought out for instance i know all mr wilcox s faults he s afraid of emotion he cares too much about success too little about the past his sympathy lacks poetry and so isn t sympathy really i d even say that spiritually he s not as honest as i am doesn t that satisfy you,Aunt Juley; Fraulein Mosebach; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,298,2061,well you look grave doesn t she frieda,i needn t say how much it would mean to me,Aunt Juley; Fraulein Mosebach; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,787,1064,i should like to know how he got hold of your card,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,789,2258,then did the card see the wife,not ill eternally tired he has worked very hard all his life and noticed nothing those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,791,1507,no just a little longer it is so beautiful tell me oh yes did you say money is the warp of the world,let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude i ll do nothing no doubt you re right logically and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about henry only i won t have it so choose if you promise to take them quietly to the george i will speak to henry about them in my own way mind there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice i have no use for justice if it was only a question of money we could do it ourselves but he wants work and that we can t give him but possibly henry can,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,793,754,then what s the woof,yes you must do,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,801,189,why meg they re so much nicer generally i d rather think of that forester s house in pomerania than of the fat herr forstmeister who lived in it,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,870,1167,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once,oh helen stop saying don t it s ignorant it s as if your head wasn t out of the slime don t is probably what mrs bast says all the day to mr bast well,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,882,1511,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper,take them off to the george then and i ll try poor creatures but they look tired i haven t nearly done with you though helen you have been most self indulgent i can t get over it you have less restraint rather than more as you grow older think it over and alter yourself or we shan t have happy lives,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,888,2007,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote,i don t agree in two thousand years they ll know look where tibby spilt the soup,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1059,889,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time,a friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured,Aunt Juley; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1061,630,meg if you start in your honest english vein i shall throw the treacle at you,helen i told you about poor mrs wilcox that sad business,Aunt Juley; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1150,2041,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you,it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1153,778,tibby hurry up through i can t hold this gate indefinitely aunt juley i say aunt juley make the tea will you and frieda we ve got to talk houses and will come on afterwards,i say helen,Aunt Juley; Frieda; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1155,2273,don t don t don t meg don t don t don t do such a thing i tell you not to don t i know don t,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1157,2043,panic and emptiness don t,meaning that i was dead i felt it,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1164,128,all right i ll sit down if you ll sit down,amen,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1166,634,i do mean what i said don t it wouldn t do,yes that is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette don t you think that is extraordinarily generous it has made me like him very much he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future i like mr wilcox he is taking up his work rubber it is a big business i gather he is launching out rather charles is in it too charles is married a pretty little creature but she doesn t seem wise they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1168,2158,tell me about it first and meanwhile perhaps i ll have got my head out of the slime,but tourists who pretend each hotel is their home,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1170,1979,then you love him,the car has gone and here s your cab,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1172,632,but loved him,i have had a correspondence with her son he was winding up the estate and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything i thought it good of him considering i knew her so little i said that she had once spoken of giving me a christmas present but we both forgot about it afterwards,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1174,679,but you will,but how on earth,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1176,114,and have settled to marry him,how helen,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1178,2262,it is ever since paul,you d be odd if you didn t,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1180,780,but he was there they were all there that morning when i came down to breakfast and saw that paul was frightened the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen so that i knew it was impossible because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever and not this outer life of telegrams and anger,are we really going to follow up mr bast,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1182,1991,no it doesn t it makes me feel worse and worse you must be mad,i warehoused that in london why,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1184,750,and to me and to all women so one kissed paul,you ve not been content to dream as we have,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1186,866,it makes no difference thinking things out they come to the same,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1188,2011,one would lose something,then you re right and it must have been soup i was thinking of much later that unsuccessful visit of aunt juley s when she didn t realise that tibby had grown up it was coffee then for he threw it down on purpose there was some rhyme tea coffee coffee tea that she said to him every morning at breakfast wait a minute how did it go,Helen; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1272,782,good morning mr wilcox,i think we won t,Henry; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1305,1965,oh mr wilcox about the porphyrion,the house is dead why worry on about it,Henry; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1311,124,and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary,to think that because you and a young man meet for a moment there must be all these telegrams and anger i ve often thought about it helen it s one of the most interesting things in the world the truth is that there is a great outer life that you and i have never touched a life in which telegrams and anger count personal relations that we think supreme are not supreme there there love means marriage settlements death death duties so far i m clear but here my difficulty this outer life though obviously horrid often seems the real one there s grit in it it does breed character do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end,Henry; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1332,214,but he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion i don t like those men they are scientific themselves and talk of the survival of the fittest and cut down the salaries of their clerks and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort but yet they believe that somehow good it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome and that in some mystical way the mr basts of the future will benefit because the mr brits of today are in pain,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1334,2067,but oh meg what a theory,expect me back before dark i am looking forward to it so much it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1342,984,yes there is a mystery i can t help it it s not my fault it s the way life has been made go on and marry him i think you re splendid and if any one can pull it off you will yes there is and i wasn t up to it with paul i can do only what s easy i can only entice and be enticed i can t and won t attempt difficult relations if i marry it will either be a man who s strong enough to boss me or whom i m strong enough to boss so i shan t ever marry for there aren t such men and heaven help any one whom i do marry for i shall certainly run away from him before you can say jack robinson there because i m uneducated but you you re different you re a heroine,why you re all alone,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1344,1151,you mean to keep proportion and that s heroic it s greek and i don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you go on and fight with him and help him don t ask me for help or even for sympathy henceforward i m going my own way i mean to be thorough because thoroughness is easy i mean to dislike your husband and to tell him so i mean to make no concessions to tibby if tibby wants to live with me he must lump me i mean to love you more than ever yes i do you and i have built up something real because it is purely spiritual there s no veil of mystery over us unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body the popular view is as usual exactly the wrong one our bothers are over tangible things money husbands house hunting but heaven will work of itself,wait one minute,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1471,878,they re starving i found them starving,how do you like your work,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1477,357,perhaps yes if you like i m mad but i ve brought them i ll stand injustice no longer i ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury this talk of impersonal forces this cant about god doing what we re too slack to do ourselves,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1479,798,there was a restaurant car on the train,it seems so,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1485,2248,i knew it was our last chance,i haven t the least notion,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1490,2055,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment,how do you know you ll pass out of their lives we have thought that twice before,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1497,2001,i brought them i did it all,but why has miss avery made them set to partners i shall just,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,1944,1959,i suppose not but one loses faith in everything after this,series of mistakes,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1946,2059,yes i am annoyed my wishes should have been respected i would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary but after aunt juley recovered it was not necessary planning my life as i now have to do,it would be lovely to have you once more alone it may be a chance in a thousand,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,1948,2281,i was just saying that i have stopped living haphazard one can t go through a great deal of without planning one s actions in advance i am going to have a child in june and in the first place conversations discussions excitement are not good for me i will go through them if necessary but only then in the second place i have no right to trouble people i cannot fit in with england as i know it i have done something that the english never pardon it would not be right for them to pardon it so i must live where i am not known,oh we merely settled down you and henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive all through the autumn and the winter,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,2056,1189,because my plans,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2058,1963,then because my life is great and theirs are little i know of things they can t know of and so do you we know that there s poetry we know that there s death they can only take them on hearsay we know this is our house because it feels ours oh they may take the title deeds and the door keys but for this one night we are at home,no one,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2060,1345,yes and we could talk it won t be a very glorious story but under that wych elm honestly i see little happiness ahead cannot i have this one night with you,perhaps,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2062,1482,then let us,very well i too am sorry about them but it beats me why you ve brought them here or why you re here yourself,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Helen,Margaret,2141,2148,one isolates i isolated mr wilcox from the other forces that were pulling leonard downhill consequently i was full of pity and almost of revenge for weeks i had blamed mr wilcox only and so when your letters came,except mrs wilcox dearest no one understands our little movements,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2143,2283,i did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the basts,you were both ill at the time i did the obvious things i had two invalids to nurse here was a house ready furnished and empty it was obvious i didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home no doubt i have done a little towards straightening the tangle but things that i can t phrase have helped me,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2145,687,looking back darling i know that it was right it is right to save the man whom one loves i am less enthusiastic about justice now but we both thought you wrote at his dictation it seemed the last touch of his callousness being very much wrought up by this time and mrs bast was upstairs i had not seen her and had talked for a long time to leonard i had snubbed him for no reason and that should have warned me i was in danger so when the notes came i wanted us to go to you for an explanation he said that he guessed the explanation he knew of it and you mustn t know i pressed him to tell me he said no one must know it was something to do with his wife right up to the end we were mr bast and miss schlegel i was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when i saw his eyes and guessed that mr wilcox had ruined him in two ways not one i drew him to me i made him tell me i felt very lonely myself he is not to blame he would have gone on worshipping me i want never to see him again though it sounds appalling i wanted to give him money and feel finished oh meg the little that is known about these things the little too that is known about growth both times it was loneliness and the night and panic afterwards did leonard grow out of paul,tibby and i have again been wondering where we ll live next september,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2147,1173,i did react until i found poor leonard i am steady now i shan t ever like your henry dearest meg or even speak kindly about him but all that blinding hate is over i shall never rave against wilcoxes any more i understand how you married him and you will now be very happy yes i do at last understand,no,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2149,118,because in death i agree,i don t think that the wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people particularly the wife,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2153,800,why should miss avery work for us,now that we have to leave wickham place i begin to think it s that for mrs wilcox it was certainly howards end it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2155,788,this is not quite our house yet when miss avery called i felt we are only a couple of tourists,but he said something about a concert and an umbrella,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2157,1054,but affectionate tourists,shan t i go up to town to day take the house if it s the least possible and then come down by the afternoon train to morrow and start enjoying myself i shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2159,2266,i can t pretend very long sitting under this tree one forgets but i know that to morrow i shall see the moon rise out of germany not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case unless you will come with me,and he likes you because you don t,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2161,2057,you would not but i am serious in asking you,which you change in a moment,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2245,1161,i haven t any idea do you suppose baby may meg,what s happened to you,Margaret; Tom,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2247,2277,tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay,not for us but for him is it sweetening yet,Margaret; Tom,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2249,2027,now tom baby is not to stand he is not to lie on his face he is not to lie so that his head wags he is not to be teased or tickled and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter will you be as careful as all that,do you oh very well but we ve nothing to put it in and he wants the can,Margaret; Tom,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2251,1509,he is fond of baby that s why he does it they re going to be lifelong friends,nor am i concerned with duty i m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know and how things being as they are things may be made a little better mr wilcox hates being asked favours all business men do but i am going to ask him at the risk of a rebuff because i want to make things a little better,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2253,2150,of course it will be a great thing for tom,not quite i feel that you and i and henry are only fragments of that woman s mind she knows everything she is everything she is the house and the tree that leans over it people have their own deaths as well as their own lives and even if there is nothing beyond death we shall differ in our nothingness i cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine she knew about realities she knew when people were in love though she was not in the room i don t doubt that she knew when henry deceived her,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2255,671,what a time they all are what can they be doing inside i wish henry was out to enjoy this this lovely weather and to be shut up in the house it s very hard,now helen what did really happen,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2257,1148,meg is or isn t he ill i can t make out,not exactly,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2259,784,i suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle,it s no good i think unless you really mean to know people the discussion brought that home to me we got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement but think of rational intercourse we mustn t play at friendship no it s no good,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2261,2285,why does he want them meg may i tell you something i like henry,i think so there are moments when i feel howards end peculiarly our own,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2263,1941,i usen t to,i told you nothing that was true,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2265,1333,i like henry because he does worry,he is such a man in theory but oh helen in theory,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2267,819,about love i mean a woman s love for a man i supposed i should hang my life on to that once and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me but everything is peaceful now i seem cured that herr forstmeister whom frieda keeps writing about must be a noble character but he doesn t see that i shall never marry him or anyone it isn t shame or mistrust of myself i simply couldn t i m ended i used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing but it hasn t been it has been itself a dream do you agree,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2272,1961,baby s not to try and stand there s something wanting in me i see you loving henry and understanding him better daily and i know that death wouldn t part you in the least but i is it some awful appalling criminal defect,all,Margaret; Tom,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2274,1484,yes yes but what has leonard got out of life,yes to morrow,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2276,1171,is that enough,it is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you the mere fact of that grows more tremendous remember i ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2278,217,no only withered,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2280,1343,oh meg you are a person think of the racket and torture this time last year but now i couldn t stop unhappy if i tried what a change and all through you,oh helen am i will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2282,986,yes but who settled us down you you did it all sweetest though you re too stupid to see living here was your plan i wanted you he wanted you and everyone said it was impossible but you knew just think of our lives without you meg i and baby with monica revolting by theory he handed about from dolly to evie but you picked up the pieces and made us a home can t it strike you even for a moment that your life has been heroic can t you remember the two months after charles s arrest when you began to act and did all,come back to the wilcoxes and tell me later mr w much concerned and slightly titillated,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2284,1967,i hope it will be permanent,interested are you very well i must tell you i suppose my husband lent it on condition we but by a mistake all our things were unpacked and miss avery instead of look here i can t go on like this i warn you i won t helen why should you be so miserably unkind to me simply because you hate henry,Margaret,F,major,F,major
Helen,Margaret,2286,1498,all the same london s creeping you see that in surrey and even hampshire now i can see it from the purbeck downs and london is only part of something else i m afraid life s going to be melted down all over the world because a thing is going strong now it need not go strong for ever this craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years it may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement because it will rest on the earth all the signs are against it now but i can t help hoping and very early in the morning in the garden i feel that our house is the future as well as the past,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there,Margaret,F,major,F,major

Charles Wilcox,Mr. Wilcox,616,625,that paul business was pretty scandalous though,in that case i shall let it pass it s not worth while having a row,Dolly; Evie; Mr. Wilcox,M,major,M,major
Charles Wilcox,Mr. Wilcox,622,604,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible,Dolly; Evie; Mr. Wilcox,M,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,695,1599,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially,i suppose that s pretty obvious but jacky never meant to do anybody any harm when things went wrong or i heard things i used to think it was her fault but looking back it s more mine i needn t have married her but as i have i must stick to her and keep her,Leonard; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,697,1597,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back,no oh no miss schlegel no,Leonard; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,703,737,then why,i managed one wood and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill i rather fancy it was those north downs for the road went off into grass and i got into another wood that was awful with gorse bushes i did wish i d never come but suddenly it got light just while i seemed going under one tree then i found a road down to a station and took the first train i could back to london,Leonard; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,705,1619,no inconvenience but i still don t understand i still don t understand when did you say you paid this call,because i see one must have money,Leonard; Margaret; Tibby,F,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,731,1495,did you actually go off the roads,i hate all this,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,734,732,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,736,696,yes but the wood this ere wood how did you get out of it,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,738,712,but was the dawn wonderful,i don t call that fair i know what you mean and it isn t so,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,740,730,just a grey evening turned upside down i know,you ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,744,722,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater,yes but we d been talking it over at the office there s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things the fellows there said one steers by the pole star and i looked it up in the celestial atlas but once out of doors everything gets so mixed,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,747,735,heaven help us if we do,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,758,1613,that s rather a sad view of life surely,don t you worry i can t bear that we shall be all right if i get work if i could only get work something regular to do then it wouldn t be so bad again i don t trouble after books as i used i can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again it stops one thinking,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,873,1621,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all,i wish i was wrong but the clergyman he has money of his own or else he s paid the poet or the musician just the same the tramp he s no different the tramp goes to the workhouse in the end and is paid for with other people s money miss schlegel the real thing s money and all the rest is a dream,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,875,876,oh yes,ladies brighten,Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,912,1629,yes,i must be stupid,Evie; Henry; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,914,720,to help you you silly boy and don t shout,i don t know nor for how long it got too dark to see my watch,Evie; Henry; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1488,1591,you have fainted perhaps the air will do you good,quite so quite so,Jacky; Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1494,909,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1500,741,it s work he wants can t you see,and i was too tired to lift up my head to look at it and so cold too i m glad i did it and yet at the time it bored me more than i can say and besides you can believe me or not as you choose i was very hungry that dinner at wimbledon i meant it to last me all night like other dinners i never thought that walking would make such a difference why when you re walking you want as it were a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well and i d nothing but a packet of woodbines lord i did feel bad looking back it wasn t what you may call enjoyment it was more a case of sticking to it i did stick i i was determined oh hang it all what s the good i mean the good of living in a room for ever there one goes on day after day same old game same up and down to town until you forget there is any other game you ought to see once in a way what s going on outside if it s only nothing particular after all,Jacky; Leonard; Margaret,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1578,1611,mr wilcox is so illogical if we told him it was his duty to take you on he might refuse to do it the fact is he isn t properly educated i don t want to set you against him but you ll find him a trial,i don t think so miss schlegel i hope not,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1580,1623,i believe in personal responsibility don t you and in personal everything i hate i suppose i oughtn t to say that but the wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely or perhaps it isn t their fault perhaps the little thing that says i is missing out of the middle of their heads and then it s a waste of time to blame them there s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says i had you heard that,i wonder,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1582,874,had you thought it then that there are two kinds of people our kind who live straight from the middle of their heads and the other kind who can t because their heads have no middle they can t say i they aren t in fact and so they re supermen pierpont morgan has never said i in his life,the more a lady has to say the better,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1584,1627,oh no that s wrong no superman ever said i want because i want must lead to the question who am i and so to pity and to justice he only says want want europe if he s napoleon want wives if he s bluebeard want botticelli if he s pierpont morgan never the i and if you could pierce through the superman you d find panic and emptiness in the middle,but what is the difference,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1586,706,of course,call what call,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1588,708,of course all presentable people say i,in the afternoon of course,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1590,743,i don t know that it s any good discussing mr wilcox either,curious it should all come about from reading something of richard jefferies,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1592,1603,mrs bast does she ever say i is she very tired,they will not have anything to do with us they had a sort of family council when they heard i was married and cut us off altogether,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1594,1589,shall i sit up with her,but mr wilcox he is not perhaps,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1596,739,mr bast what kind of woman is your wife you ought to know my ways by now does that question offend you,no the dawn was only grey it was nothing to mention,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1598,1617,because i love honesty don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one you and she can have nothing in common,walking is well enough when a man s in work oh i did talk a lot of nonsense once but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you when i saw him fingering my ruskins and stevensons i seemed to see life straight and real and it isn t a pretty sight my books are back again thanks to you but they ll never be the same to me again and i shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1600,911,how long have you been married,you ask me why i turn on you,Leonard,F,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,1608,1581,from this very shropshire yes that is odd my mother s people were lancashire but why do your brother and your sisters object to mrs bast,i get no time for reading,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1610,1583,excuse me you do know i am not a baby i can bear anything you tell me and the more you tell the more i shall be able to help have they heard anything against her i think i have guessed now,i never got on to nietzsche but i always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1612,897,we must be honest even over these things i have guessed i am frightfully dreadfully sorry but it does not make the least difference to me i shall feel just the same to both of you i blame not your wife for these things but men,one can but see as ibsen says things happen,Leonard,F,major,M,major

Helen,Leonard,1620,1593,well you re wrong,it s better she stops in her room,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1622,1585,you re still wrong you ve forgotten death if we lived forever what you say would be true but we have to die we have to leave life presently injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever as it is we must hold to other things because death is coming i love death not morbidly but because he explains he shows me the emptiness of money death and money are the eternal foes not death and life never mind what lies behind death mr bast but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say i am i,may i take it miss schlegel that you and i are both the sort that say i,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1624,1489,we are all in a mist i know but i can help you this far men like the wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any sane sound englishmen building up empires levelling all the world into what they call common sense but mention death to them and they re offended because death s really imperial and he cries out against them for ever,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether,Leonard,F,major,M,major
Helen,Leonard,1626,704,but not of the idea of death,i said to my wife i said to mrs bast and mrs bast said to me while i was gone however she wanted me on important business and thought i had come here owing to the card and so came after me and i beg to tender my apologies and hers as well for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you,Leonard,F,major,M,major

Henry,Margaret,855,1082,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales,horribly hullo parliament s back,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,861,1651,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to,would you ring the bell please,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,863,1869,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other,i suppose so,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,942,1191,you behave much too well to people and then they impose on you i know the world and that type of man and as soon as i entered the room i saw you had not been treating him properly you must keep that type at a distance otherwise they forget themselves sad but true they aren t our sort and one must face the fact,i little thought then certainly did you,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,944,1891,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,946,1854,what did he suspect you of,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,948,1023,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,952,1237,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,954,1286,oh he s one of that writer sort,more right than the porphyrion,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,956,2106,your mistake is this and it is a very common mistake this young bounder has a life of his own what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life or as you call it grey,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,958,1193,one minute you know nothing about him he probably has his own joys and interests wife children snug little home that s where we practical fellows are more tolerant than you intellectuals we live and let live and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs i quite grant i look at the faces of the clerks in my own office and observe them to be dull but i don t know what s going on beneath so by the way with london i have heard you rail against london miss schlegel and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you what do you know about london you only see civilisation from the outside i don t say in your case but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity discontent and socialism,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,960,1704,with you,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,973,1513,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say,you ll never believe me it s all right now but it was my sister,Evie; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,993,1456,i thought i d get round if i could evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table always secure a table first evie don t pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don t miss schlegel come in my side out of pity my goodness but you look tired been worrying round after your young clerks,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous,Evie; Margaret; Mr. Cahill,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,1005,1919,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all,Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,1868,928,i see you have scruples,oh yes,Charles Wilcox; Margaret; Tibby,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1870,1353,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness,why did he go so suddenly,Charles Wilcox; Margaret; Tibby,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1872,1033,you said just now,i could indeed i will when i talked about scrubbing my aura i was only trying to be funny but why do you want this settled,Charles Wilcox; Margaret; Tibby,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,1886,1090,she was bound to drive there will be her books,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that,Dolly; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1890,1045,you re not fit for it let me go alone i know exactly what to do,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice,Dolly; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1892,1078,don t you want to tidy yourself,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things,Dolly; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,1905,1092,and have quite forgiven me then listen her cab should already have arrived at howards end we re a little late but no matter our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm as if possible one doesn t want a scene before servants a certain gentleman won t drive in but will wait a little short of the front gate behind the laurels have you still the keys of the house,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends,Crane; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1907,2128,well they aren t wanted do you remember how the house stands,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry,Crane; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1910,955,i was just saying to my wife mansbridge that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel the house as you know is my property so it should seem quite natural for us to be there the trouble is evidently nervous wouldn t you say so margaret,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both,Crane; Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1914,1463,is the truant all right,the alexandrina,Helen; Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1916,1201,margaret you look upset you might have given me a knock with the gate,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably,Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1918,1249,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment,Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1920,1858,manage what,how will you do that,Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,1922,1207,come this is an odd beginning,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery,Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Margaret,1934,1197,margaret margaret,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby,Mansbridge; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2071,1279,is it what we feared,not a bad business,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2073,1211,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2075,1223,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you,be generous to them bother justice,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2077,1302,would she not tell you,and you chew the bark for toothache,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2079,1559,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you,why does she call you hen has she ever seen you before,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2081,1647,as you like,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2083,2120,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2085,2092,i thought it best to ring up charles,but henry suppose he turned out to be married already one has heard of such cases,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2087,1049,he has at once gone to call on your brother,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2089,972,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2091,1108,if possible yes,oh yes indeed yes,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2093,817,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life,but this is going to be far better than the debate itself,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2095,1659,certainly my dear,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2097,1027,well possibly she is right,gruyere please,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2099,1006,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2101,1076,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2103,1841,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2105,2126,if she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two we shall never get her out of the house perhaps,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2107,1523,do you intend to sleep in a damp house too,shall i,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2109,2104,that s quite impossible madness you must be here to meet charles,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2111,1235,margaret my margaret,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2113,1902,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2115,951,my dear you are forgetting yourself,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2117,1086,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2119,1002,as i have actually been forgiven,perhaps it does make life more human,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2121,1284,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2123,1239,i beg your pardon,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2125,1205,you have not been yourself all day,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2127,1904,the two cases are different,look my hands have stopped trembling,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2230,1860,i prefer to discuss things with you outside,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2232,1031,what about,not even that it may be halfway in the wrong direction i can t explain i don t believe in all these fads and yet i don t like saying that i don t believe in them,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2234,1277,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down,not a bad surely on chelsea embankment,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2236,1225,i have something to tell you,but how much have you got,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2238,1106,where are you going,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2240,860,after the inquest,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2242,1917,have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be,go away,Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Margaret,2313,1209,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i,why not,Margaret,,,F,major
Margaret,Henry,804,1536,what an age it is since i ve seen you mr wilcox i met evie in the tube though lately i hope you have good news of your son,all right i ll see him,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,828,1888,why,finish your coffee dear we must be off,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,830,1291,dear me helen listen to that and he ll have to get another place,what about next wednesday,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,832,2091,rather than wait to make sure,if possible yes,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,834,1874,why s that,margaret margaret no education can teach a woman logic now my dear my time is valuable do you want me to help you or not,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,839,934,not well,i,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,841,1901,then do you really advise us to tell this youth,i was meaning to act for the best,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,848,1107,and how s howards end looking,miss schlegel margaret you don t understand,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,850,1922,really and you wandering homeless in longhaired chelsea how strange are the ways of fate,come this is an odd beginning,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,852,2073,why i thought of you both as anchored there for ever evie never told me,dear girl there is a troublesome business ahead of us and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through i am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched as you know i am not one of your bernard shaws who consider nothing sacred to speak as i must will pain me but there are occasions we are husband and wife not children i am a man of the world and you are a most exceptional woman i see that you feel as i felt when my poor little wife oh be brave just one or two questions and i have done with you was your sister wearing a wedding ring,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,854,1030,as far as the house never,yet there may be something in it all the same,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,856,936,what a change i can t imagine howards end or hilton without you,i hardly consider that a fair deduction,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,858,2117,still but i thought he was still at epsom they were furnishing that christmas one christmas how everything alters i used to admire mrs charles from our windows very often wasn t it epsom,helen commands my sympathy as your husband i shall do all for her that i can and i have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning but i cannot treat her as if nothing has happened i should be false to my position in society if i did,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,860,2099,i manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves when you moved out of howards end i should have moved mr charles wilcox into it i should have kept so remarkable a place in the family,why howards end would she not be more comfortable as i suggested at the hotel,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,862,956,no but none of you are there,your mistake is this and it is a very common mistake this young bounder has a life of his own what right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life or as you call it grey,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,866,1857,do remind evie to come and see us 2 wickham place we shan t be there very long either,yes yes don t interrupt i ve got it it s perfectly easy leave it to me we ll send her down to howards end,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,868,958,next september,one minute you know nothing about him he probably has his own joys and interests wife children snug little home that s where we practical fellows are more tolerant than you intellectuals we live and let live and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs i quite grant i look at the faces of the clerks in my own office and observe them to be dull but i don t know what s going on beneath so by the way with london i have heard you rail against london miss schlegel and it seems a funny thing to say but i was very angry with you what do you know about london you only see civilisation from the outside i don t say in your case but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity discontent and socialism,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,925,2083,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand,next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything i have often noticed your insight dear i only wish my own was as good you may have guessed something even though your sister said nothing the slightest hint would help us,Evie; Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,931,1668,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you,practical you practical,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,933,1514,do you realise that it s all your fault you re responsible,helen here but she refused the invitation i thought hated weddings,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,935,1713,this is the young man whom we were to warn against the porphyrion we warn him and look,but my dear which would you rather have alterations or rheumatism,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,937,1295,obviously unfair i was only thinking how tangled things are it s our fault mostly neither yours nor his,oh that ll be all right i ll speak to her,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,939,946,no,what did he suspect you of,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,943,1528,ye es,how old,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,945,1642,i admit it willingly a gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself,you re referring to last evening i have released you from your engagement i could find excuses but i won t no i won t a thousand times no i m a bad lot and must be left at that,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,947,1105,of wanting to make money out of him,miss schlegel i have had you up on false pretences i want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house could you be induced to share my is it probable,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,949,960,exactly how indeed just horrible corroding suspicion one touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes,with you,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,951,1558,let me explain exactly why we like this man and want to see him again,pray don t apologise,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,953,2129,i do firstly because he cares for physical adventure just as you do yes you go motoring and shooting he would like to go camping out secondly he cares for something special in adventure it is quickest to call that special something poetry,i perceive you are attempting blackmail it is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband my rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats and i can only repeat what i said before i do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at howards end,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,955,1375,no oh no i mean he may be but it would be loathsome stuff his brain is filled with the husks of books culture horrible we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing we want to show him how he may get upsides with life as i said either friends or the country some either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey and to show that it is grey if possible one should have both,no i shall be back before i m gone,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,957,2097,because,well possibly she is right,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,959,1274,his wife is an old bore he never came home last saturday night because he wanted to be alone and she thought he was with us,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,963,1524,naughty when you re married miss wilcox won t you want outside interests,if it isn t a long story,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,968,1232,miss wilcox he was,i,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,970,1654,he said so and about such a thing he wouldn t lie that s where i differ from you men lie about their positions and prospects but not about a thing of that sort,it is no good those things leak out you cannot stop a story once it has started i have known cases of other men i despised them once i thought that i m different i shall never be tempted oh margaret we fellows all come to grief once in our time will you believe that there are moments when the strongest man that s true isn t it if you knew all you would excuse me i was far from good influences far even from england i was very very lonely and longed for a woman s voice that s enough i have told you too much already for you to forgive me now,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,972,1196,i said before he isn t a type he cares about adventures rightly he s certain that our smug existence isn t all he s vulgar and hysterical and bookish but don t think that sums him up there s manhood in him as well yes that s what i m trying to say he s a real man,i was thinking if you didn t mind that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk there will be so much to settle,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,974,1003,i forget,then the fellows know one again especially in the east if you tip they remember you from year s end to year s end,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,978,2121,yes pretty well but i wonder what helen s doing,i seem rather unaccommodating but i have some experience of life and know how one thing leads to another i am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel i have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider i am sorry but see that she leaves my house at once,Evie; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,994,1289,no after houses i m hungry not tired i want to eat heaps,if he sublets i shan t have the same control in theory there should be no more damage done at howards end in practice there will be things may be done for which no money can compensate for instance i shouldn t want that fine wych elm spoilt it hangs margaret we must go and see the old place some time it s pretty in its way we ll motor down and have lunch with charles,Evie; Henry; Mr. Cahill,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,996,1032,fish pie,so you wouldn t give me your word that you don t hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it,Evie; Henry; Mr. Cahill,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,998,1460,go for something for me then,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home,Evie; Henry; Mr. Cahill,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1000,1516,yes,let em all come,Evie; Henry; Mr. Cahill,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1002,1091,perhaps it does make life more human,i am glad very glad there is so much cant talked in would be intellectual circles i am glad you don t share it self denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character but i can t stand those people who run down comforts they have usually some axe to grind can you,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1004,938,have you been in the east,not his,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1006,1208,no i m house hunting mr wilcox as i ve already told you once do you know of any houses,moderately but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1008,2313,well what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house we merely want a small house with large rooms and plenty of them,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1017,2119,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s,as i have actually been forgiven,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1019,1089,no you d hate it it s all proteids and body buildings and people come up to you and beg your pardon but you have such a beautiful aura,i m glad you don t despise the goods of this world,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1021,1117,never heard of an aura oh happy happy man i scrub at mine for hours nor of an astral plane just so luckily it was helen s aura not mine and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses i just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went,there s just one question,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1023,1373,you re bound to have one but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it,that s no good it s locked who s got the key margaret you wait in the dry i ll go down for the key it isn t a hundred yards,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1025,1111,too difficult a question,thank you,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1039,2113,can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us we re nearly demented,as the future owner of howards end i should say that it did concern charles,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1041,840,but i do budge gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses cow them with an eye and up they come trembling ladies can t it s the houses that are mesmerising me i ve no control over the saucy things houses are alive no,there you are,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1043,969,did i i mean i did more or less i talk the same way to every one or try to,m m m m,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1045,979,that s his lookout i don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company one can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food there s no nourishment in it you pass it to the lower classes and they pass it back to you and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything our friends at chelsea don t see this they say one ought to be at all costs intelligible and sacrifice,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1047,1920,every one admits that,manage what,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1049,1541,my socialists do yours mayn t but i strongly suspect yours of being not socialists but ninepins which you have constructed for your own amusement i can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily,i can t fit in your proteges every day business would suffer,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1072,1532,this is awfully kind of you but i m afraid it s not going to do the house has not been built that suits the schlegel family,where was he before,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1074,2089,not exactly,let me explain dear how the matter stands you don t think that i and my son are other than gentlemen it is in helen s interests that we are acting it is still not too late to save her name,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1076,835,presumably it s very beautiful how do you like it crane,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1078,2115,why i know crane i ve been for a drive with evie once i know that you ve got a parlourmaid called milton i know all sorts of things,my dear you are forgetting yourself,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1080,1662,in my absurd way i m lonely too it s heart breaking to leave one s old home i scarcely remember anything before wickham place and helen and tibby were born there helen says,oh ah yes dear would you like one turn in the garden,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1082,1715,horribly hullo parliament s back,what a practical little woman it is what s it been reading theo theo how much,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1084,2240,only some rubbish about furniture helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas just imagine it rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them,after the inquest,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1086,1198,she says yes my brother says no to ducie street it s no fun helping us mr wilcox i assure you,with your brother,Crane; Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1090,1242,heavens no only idiots and prigs do that,how about september for us too,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1092,944,comforts are of two kinds those we can share with others like fire weather or music and those we can t food food for instance it depends,do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman,Crane; Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1098,1200,ye es semi rubbish are those cruikshanks,oh very well,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1100,1218,does all this furniture come from howards end,exactly the girl s madly in love with him a very good sort of fellow but he demands and rightly a suitable provision with her and in the second place you will naturally understand there is charles before leaving town i wrote charles a very careful letter you see he has an increasing family and increasing expenses and the i and w a is nothing particular just now though capable of development,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1102,855,does however i m concerned with the house not the furniture how big is this smoking room,well howards end is one of those converted farms they don t really do spend what you will on them we messed away with a garage all among the wych elm roots and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery evie got rather keen on alpine plants but it didn t do no it didn t do you remember your sister will remember the farm with those abominable guinea fowls and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly so that it all went thin at the bottom and inside the house the beams and the staircase through a door picturesque enough but not a place to live in full tide and the position wasn t right either the neighbourhood s getting suburban either be in london or out of it i say so we ve taken a house in ducie street close to sloane street and a place right down in shropshire oniton grange ever heard of oniton do come and see us right away from everywhere up towards wales,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1104,1876,ah well mr wilcox aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses,answer my question plain question plain answer do,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1106,950,oh mr wilcox i see i see i will write to you afterwards if i may,i come back to my original point you ought to be more careful miss schlegel your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1108,857,oh yes indeed yes,hilton isn t without us charles is there still,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1110,1356,how could i be offended good bye you will have a letter from me i am going back to swanage to morrow,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1116,2123,not at all,i beg your pardon,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1189,1034,do you remember the embankment at chelsea it can t be ten days ago,i don t know,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1191,1936,i little thought then certainly did you,mansbridge perhaps not now,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1193,1371,why was it earlier did you think of me this way earlier how extraordinarily interesting henry tell me i didn t think of it no when you spoke to me in the drawing room that was practically the first it was all so different from what it s supposed to be on the stage or in books a proposal is how shall i put it a full blown affair a kind of bouquet it loses its literal meaning but in life a proposal really is a proposal,we are,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1195,973,a suggestion a seed,miss schlegel you re a pair of dear creatures but you really must be careful in this uncharitable world what does your brother say,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1197,2238,i think so too tell me in the first place how did you get on with tibby,where are you going,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1199,1861,yes during cigarettes,of course you won t tell her you re going when she is there looking at the cases you ll just stroll in if nothing is wrong with her so much the better but there ll be the motor round the corner and we can run her to a specialist in no time,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1201,1457,i am so glad what did you talk about me presumably,why not,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1203,1650,greece was a very good card henry tibby s only a boy still and one has to pick and choose subjects a little well done,i heard of none,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1205,2095,what a delightful thing to have shares in can t we go there for our honeymoon,certainly my dear,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1207,1026,to eat the currants and isn t there marvellous scenery,why s that gruyere or stilton,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1209,1892,why not,don t you want to tidy yourself,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1211,1563,some ladies do without hotels are you aware that helen and i have walked alone over the apennines with our luggage on our backs,don t you indeed i do allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1213,1711,you haven t found time for a talk with helen yet i suppose,i have not yet decided what about norfolk it is now what nearly october let us camp for the winter at ducie street and look out for something in the spring,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1215,2307,do before you go i am so anxious you two should be friends,good bye dolly,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1217,1545,dolly s uncle,she s something else this won t do i can t have her in my garden in this state,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1219,1928,poor fellow,come come margaret this is a terrible business an appalling business it s doctor s orders open the door,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1221,2127,of course not you mean money how stupid i am of course not,the two cases are different,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1223,1903,be generous to them bother justice,certainly dear girl are you all right now,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1225,1705,but how much have you got,my dear girl have you eyes have you a skin how could it be anything but damp in such a situation in the first place the grange is on clay and built where the castle moat must have been then there s that detestable little river steaming all night like a kettle feel the cellar walls look up under the eaves ask sir james or any one those shropshire valleys are notorious the only possible place for a house in shropshire is on a hill but for my part i think the country is too far from london and the scenery nothing special,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1227,1384,how much have you a year i ve six hundred,she really did frighten you poor margaret and very naturally uneducated classes are so stupid,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1229,1001,yes we must begin with how much you have before we can settle how much you can give charles justice and even generosity depend on that,it s a golden rule to tip the carver tip everywhere s my motto,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1231,1648,don t you know your income or don t you want to tell it me,good god no let them gossip my game s up though i thank you for your unselfishness little as my thanks are worth,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1233,1341,that s all right don t tell me i don t want to know i can do the sum just as well by proportion divide your income into ten parts how many parts would you give to evie how many to charles how many to paul,good i did the breaking of the ice,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1235,861,yes we ve settled that go ahead give away all you can bearing in mind that i ve a clear six hundred what a mercy it is to have all this money about one,so it is i haven t sold it and don t mean to,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1237,849,helen wouldn t agree with me here helen daren t slang the rich being rich herself but she would like to there s an odd notion that i haven t yet got hold of running about at the back of her brain that poverty is somehow real she dislikes all organisation and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her cheques do helen is too relentless one can t deal in her high handed manner with the world,it s let,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1239,1894,keep it on at least it depends when do you want to marry me,yes plenty,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1241,1660,the earlier the nicer henry females are not supposed to say such things but the earlier the nicer,what did you say in the notes,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1243,1246,right shall we go into ducie street ourselves in september or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into it that s rather an idea they are so unbusinesslike we could make them do anything by judicious management look here yes we ll do that and we ourselves could live at howards end or shropshire,shows things are moving good for trade,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1245,1905,how sad it s only a few years since they built those pretty houses,and have quite forgiven me then listen her cab should already have arrived at howards end we re a little late but no matter our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm as if possible one doesn t want a scene before servants a certain gentleman won t drive in but will wait a little short of the front gate behind the laurels have you still the keys of the house,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1247,1522,i hate this continual flux of london it is an epitome of us at our worst eternal formlessness all the qualities good bad and indifferent streaming away streaming streaming for ever that s why i dread it so i mistrust rivers even in scenery now the sea,why later on tell me now no time like the present,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1249,1440,but i always do go about alone considering i ve walked over the apennines it s common sense you will make me so angry i don t the least take it as a compliment,well hurry up and change,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1251,1851,can t i look after myself i do wish,well my dear how am i to know,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1268,1918,it isn t frittering away the strength it s enlarging the space in which you may be strong,margaret you look upset again my dear give me the keys what are you doing with helen,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1270,1644,here we all are,no difference no difference when you find that i am not the fellow you thought i am unworthy of you had i been worthy i should not have released you from your engagement i know what i am talking about i can t bear to talk of such things we had better leave it you with your sheltered life and refined pursuits and friends and books you and your sister and women like you i say how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man,Helen; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1273,1543,henry she has had such a nice letter from the queer cross boy do you remember him he had a sad moustache but the back of his head was young,proteges always are your protege has made us late the fussells will just be starting,Helen; Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1284,1872,he has not done that he s going into a bank in camden town he says the salary s much lower but he hopes to manage a branch of dempster s bank is that all right,you said just now,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1365,1077,yes but while they re learning,come let s be starting how on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called crane,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1368,1046,what s happened,lower classes well you do admit that there are rich and poor that s something you do admit that if wealth was divided up equally in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same the hard working man would come to the top the wastrel sink to the bottom,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1370,1204,are we there already,i was telling him i have shares in a currant farm near calamata,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1372,2079,well i never in years ago it seemed so far away,that is singular natural perhaps dear girl that you shouldn t ask but until his name is known nothing can be done sit down how terrible it is to see you so upset i knew you weren t fit for it i wish i hadn t taken you,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1374,2103,mayn t i come too,i don t agree there my dear helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes possibly more than her share for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies wouldn t you and i d raise no objection i could understand it if it was her old home because a home or a house because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred i don t know why associations and so on now helen has no associations with howards end though i and charles and evie have i do not see why she wants to stay the night there she will only catch cold,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1383,1670,not exactly,at all events you mustn t worry this is a man s business on no account mention it to anybody,Dolly; Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1452,1044,nothing,yes i know and how much of it do you suppose he understood,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1454,1859,no i have nothing to say but you may talk if there is this nasty curve couldn t we walk to the church not of course you and evie but the rest of us might very well go on first and that would mean fewer carriages,after her books tell her that she must unpack them herself then you can meet her there,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1456,1018,you men shouldn t be so chivalrous,with pleasure,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1459,1853,we shall never get through it i think it did go off well since i had to jump out of the motor i m thankful i lighted on my left hand i am so very glad about it henry dear i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable you must all remember that we have no practical person among us except my aunt and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale,oh yes she and i have always hit it off together,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1517,1250,my dear henry did you see them,it isn t meant as a compliment my dear i just won t have you going about in the dark such people about too it s dangerous,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1519,2075,the brown bunch was helen but did you catch sight of a sea green and salmon bunch,one point at a time i am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer take your time remember that this is far worse for me than for you,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1521,1095,no business they wanted to see me and later on i want to talk to you about them,right the dining room now the entrance hall here we fellows smoke,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1525,1386,oh not five minutes but there s a sting at the end of it for i want you to find the man some work in your office,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1527,995,i don t know he s a clerk,that s good what ll you have,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1529,952,twenty five perhaps,that s your clever way of talking i shall never believe you like him,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1531,1369,bast,what do you suppose,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1533,1276,dempster s bank,not a bad business that porphyrion,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1535,1709,they reduced their staff,i shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain no sooner did i sign the agreement than she got engaged poor little girl she was so keen on it all and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting afraid it would get snapped up just like all of your sex well no harm s done she has had her country wedding and i ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1538,1192,i should be glad if you took him but i don t know whether he s qualified,i don t know about that i shouldn t like to say,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1540,853,no of course of course,i dare say when you met evie the thing wasn t settled we only moved a week ago paul has rather a feeling for the old place and we held on for him to have his holiday there but really it is impossibly small endless drawbacks i forget whether you ve been up to it,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1542,842,i can promise you he s the last he he s rather a special case,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1544,1556,she s overtired,and pray why,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1546,1636,is she,did you say that your sister is sleeping here after all,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1562,1707,i don t know what it is all about let s come in,i because why have we come to the tyrol if it comes to that one might go on asking such questions indefinitely the truth is i took oniton on account of evie don t let this go any further,Henry; Jacky,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1564,1455,this is helen s plan not mine,one can t have ladies walking through the market square the fussells wouldn t like it they were awfully particular at charles s wedding my she our party was anxious to walk and certainly the church was just round the corner and i shouldn t have minded but the colonel made a great point of it,Henry; Jacky,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1572,1366,so that woman has been your mistress,the motor s come to stay one must get about there s a pretty church oh you aren t sharp enough well look out if the road worries you right outward at the scenery,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1574,1081,when please,you too feel lonely,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1576,833,when please,decidedly,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1633,1190,i have asked helen to sleep she is best here so don t lock the front door,yes and you and your sister were head and ears deep in some quixotic scheme ah well,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1635,1573,at the same time i told the man that we could do nothing for him i don t know about later but now the basts must clearly go,you put it with your usual delicacy,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1643,1547,leave it where you will boy it s not going to trouble us i know what i m talking about and it will make no difference,madam you will be more comfortable at the hotel,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1645,1028,it is difficult for us but if we are worth marrying we do guess,better have stilton,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1647,829,not to me did helen come but that won t do at all at all we don t want her gossiping with mrs bast,this is between friends it ll be in the receiver s hands before christmas it ll smash,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1649,932,didn t she send me a message or anything,oh i didn t mind oughtn t you really to be more careful,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1651,859,would you ring the bell please,yes but they moved eighteen months ago charles the good chap thought i should be lonely i didn t want him to move but he would and took a house at the other end of hilton down by the six hills he had a motor too there they all are a very jolly party he and she and the two grandchildren,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1653,2101,why to inquire i ll go thank you,she values the old furniture for sentimental reasons in fact,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1655,1038,yes that s enough dear,why of course,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1657,1575,i have already forgiven you henry,why,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1659,948,but they have gone separately helen very early the basts just before i arrived they have left no message they have answered neither of my notes i don t like to think what it all means,intolerable brute but how were you to benefit,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1661,1640,i told you last night,far too much screaming there,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1663,1220,i am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the george helen would not have left unless she had heard something i mismanaged that it is wretched i ought to have parted her from that woman at once,charles being the elder son some day charles will have howards end but i am anxious in my own happiness not to be unjust to others,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1665,1646,yes yes henry,cut off from decent society and family ties what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas isolated no one near i know by bitter experience and yet you say it makes no difference,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1667,1005,except for some practical reason never,oh greece and the levant i used to go out for sport and business to cyprus some military society of a sort there a few piastres properly distributed help to keep one s memory green but you of course think this shockingly cynical how s your discussion society getting on any new utopias lately,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1669,1293,yes i m practical,but you can give that up now,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1704,1638,where are we to live i loved the place extraordinarily don t you believe in having a permanent home henry this is news i never heard till this minute that oniton was damp,is she to be shown up to your room,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1706,1224,why did you go there then,i am determined and have already written to charles to that effect,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1708,863,certainly not,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1710,1303,where shall we live then henry i should enjoy living somewhere,what a rum notion of course not,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1712,1466,if possible something permanent i can t be as young as i was for these alterations don t suit me,they re callers it s too late for callers,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1714,1248,i see your point if oniton is really damp it is impossible and must be inhabited by little boys only in the spring let us look before we leap i will take warning by evie and not hurry you remember that you have a free hand this time these endless moves must be bad for the furniture and are certainly expensive,high tide yes and these are the men to whom we give the vote however they have their own lives and interests let s get on a nice beginning if your aunt saw you slip in alone,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1841,1236,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer,we ve none too much i assure you you re marrying a poor man,Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1850,1087,of course not,you are not as unpractical as you pretend i shall never believe it at all events you responded to my telegram promptly,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1852,1934,you know quite well that helen never sins against affection you must have noticed that much in her surely,margaret margaret,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1854,1518,no henry can t you see i don t mean that i was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past one could trace it back to the heart in the long run she behaved oddly because she cared for some one or wanted to help them there s no possible excuse for her now she is grieving us deeply and that is why i am sure that she is not well mad is too terrible a word but she is not well i shall never believe it i shouldn t discuss my sister with you if i thought she was well trouble you about her i mean,i did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman certainly,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1856,2234,for all i know she has seen one already,i am extremely tired i have been walking about all the morning and wish to sit down,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1858,867,how will you do that,you too on the move,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1860,1395,but henry that s just what she won t let me do it s part of her whatever it is never to see me,because if he has had enough tea we ought to go dolly s a good little woman but a little of her goes a long way i couldn t live near her if you paid me,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1862,1842,it s quite impossible,don t ask me i m a plain man of business i live and let live my advice to you both is don t worry margaret you ve got black marks again under your eyes you know that s strictly forbidden first your aunt then your sister no we aren t going to have it are we theobald i ll give you some tea and then you go straight to ducie street i can t have my girl looking as old as her husband,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1867,940,no henry it s sweet of you but i couldn t,miss schlegel you are too kind,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1869,1363,i suppose so,now we ll be off,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1871,1042,i deny it s madness,i m out of my depth didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1873,1526,it s madness when i say it but not when you say it,what are his qualifications,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1875,1097,not in that way,you do like it it s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable isn t it,Charles Wilcox; Henry; Tibby,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1887,1075,i cannot make it out,not exactly in that case let s be starting,Dolly; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1891,1085,oh yes i am fit only most frightfully worried i cannot feel that helen is really alive her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else her voice isn t in them i don t believe your driver really saw her at the station i wish i d never mentioned it i know that charles is vexed yes he is there dolly will forgive me there now we ll be off,your sister always likes her little joke,Dolly; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1893,2242,have i time,have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be,Dolly; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1900,1297,perhaps i was not at lunch but the whole thing is spread clearly before me now,but i ll say a word to her don t you bother,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1902,1539,just lend me your scarf will you this wind takes one s hair so,i ll do what i can but margaret this mustn t be taken as a precedent,Crane; Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1904,1099,look my hands have stopped trembling,gillrays shall we go on upstairs,Crane; Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,1919,1269,oh dearest do go away and i will manage it all,you re a clever little woman but my motto s concentrate,Henry; Mansbridge,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1921,1868,stop that at least,i see you have scruples,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1927,1212,you could but you have not you are therefore not qualified to attend my sister,i wasn t aware and if i can manage it you will never do such a thing again,Henry; Mansbridge,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1929,1222,forgive me but i will not,yes money since you put it so frankly i am determined to be just to all just to you just to them i am determined that my children shall have me,Henry; Mansbridge,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1933,1634,i do not need you in the least no more does my sister who is still many weeks from her confinement,i thought some one had got in,Henry; Mansbridge,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,1935,1202,well henry send your doctor away what possible use is he now it all turns on affection now affection don t you see surely you see i like helen very much you not so much mr mansbridge doesn t know her that s all and affection when reciprocated gives rights put that down in your note book mr mansbridge it s a useful formula you don t know what you want yourselves for one sensible remark i will let you in but you cannot make it you would trouble my sister for no reason i will not permit it i ll stand here all the day sooner,about greece too,Henry; Mansbridge,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2072,1283,it is,a clerk who clears out of any concern good or bad without securing a berth somewhere else first is a fool and i ve no pity for him,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2074,1216,no henry i really came to ask a favour about howards end,your sister and i have always hit it off but we re drifting away from our business let me begin at the beginning you know that evie is going to marry percy cahill,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2076,1228,seducer no i do not know her seducer s name,my income,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2078,1316,i never even asked her who seduced her,you seem to think let me explain the point to you it is like this you seem to assume when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage the porphyrion according to you was bound to say i am trying all i can to get into the tariff ring i am not sure that i shall succeed but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency and i am trying my dear helen,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2080,1565,i like to stand if you don t mind for it gives me a pleasant view of the six hills,i now understand your interest in the basts very well thought out i am amused at your caution margaret you are quite right it was necessary i am a man and have lived a man s past i have the honour to release you from your engagement,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,2084,2125,who is we,you have not been yourself all day,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2086,2093,that was unnecessary this news will give charles disproportionate pain,in that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct and be thrashed within an inch of his life,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2088,1079,that too was unnecessary,evie you won t see her she s gone out with cahill it s no fun i can tell you being left so much alone i ve got my work all day indeed a great deal too much of it but when i come home in the evening i tell you i can t stand the house,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2090,997,are we to make her seducer marry her,fish pie fancy coming for fish pie to simpson s it s not a bit the thing to go for here,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,2098,1036,henry let a lady finish to morrow she goes to night with your permission she would like to sleep at howards end,much the same as when you honoured it last week,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2100,1024,it is an odd request but you know what helen is and what women in her state are she has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good i think she s right being one of those imaginative girls the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her this is a fact it is the end of her girlhood her last words to me were a beautiful ending,tell me though miss schlegel do you really believe in the supernatural and all that,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2102,1083,exactly you have quite understood it is her last hope of being with it,yes they are talking again but you were going to say,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2104,1855,leave it that you don t see call it fancy but realise that fancy is a scientific fact helen is fanciful and wants to,you want to get hold of her that s the problem isn t it she has got to see a doctor,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2106,2232,well and suppose we don t get her out of the house would it matter she would do no one any harm no henry i didn t mean that we will only trouble howards end for this one night i take her to london to morrow,what about,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,2110,1103,i have already told you that your message to charles was unnecessary and i have no desire to meet him,thirty by fifteen no wait a minute fifteen and a half,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2112,2244,what has this business to do with charles if it concerns me little it concerns you less and charles not at all,no my dear manslaughter manslaughter charles may go to prison i dare not tell him i don t know what to do what to do i m broken i m ended,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2114,1464,in what way will helen s condition depreciate the property,it s off curzon street,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2116,1240,i think you yourself recommended plain speaking,i say take care i don t report you to the police evie will probably be married in september we could scarcely think of anything before then,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2118,1907,no let us go back to helen s request it is unreasonable but the request of an unhappy girl tomorrow she will go to germany and trouble society no longer to night she asks to sleep in your empty house a house which you do not care about and which you have not occupied for over a year may she will you give my sister leave will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven and as you have actually been forgiven forgive her for one night only that will be enough,well they aren t wanted do you remember how the house stands,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2120,964,never mind for the moment what i mean by that answer my question,he has apparently got them,Henry,F,major,,

Margaret,Henry,2124,1020,a rare occurrence in reply may i mention mrs bast,a what,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2126,1287,not any more of this you shall see the connection if it kills you henry you have had a mistress i forgave you my sister has a lover you drive her from the house do you see the connection stupid hypocritical cruel oh contemptible a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead a man who ruins a woman for his pleasure and casts her off to ruin other men and gives bad financial advice and then says he is not responsible these men are you you can t recognise them because you cannot connect i ve had enough of your unneeded kindness i ve spoilt you long enough all your life you have been spoiled mrs wilcox spoiled you no one has ever told what you are muddled criminally muddled men like you use repentance as a blind so don t repent only say to yourself what helen has done i ve done,yes yes yes safe as houses safer,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2128,1244,in what way different you have betrayed mrs wilcox helen only herself you remain in society helen can t you have had only pleasure she may die you have the insolence to talk to me of differences henry,heavens how you women do fly round my head s in a whirl point by point margaret howards end s impossible i let it to hamar bryce on a three years agreement last march don t you remember oniton well that is much much too far away to rely on entirely you will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount but we must have a house within easy reach of town only ducie street has huge drawbacks there s a mews behind yes in summer especially the mews is a serious nuisance the smoking room too is an abominable little den the house opposite has been taken by operatic people ducie street s going down it s my private opinion,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2231,1210,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message,no hotels,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2233,1909,i am going to germany with my sister i must tell you now that i shall make it my permanent home our talk last night was more important than you have realised i am unable to forgive you and am leaving you,if we don t find her in the porch we can stroll round into the garden our object,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2235,1870,certainly if you will consent to sit on the grass here are your keys,and sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer you could have got her down to swanage by a word but you had scruples and scruples are all very well i am as scrupulous as any man alive i hope but when it is a case like this when there is a question of madness,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2237,1040,i don t want to hear it my sister is going to be ill my life is going to be with her now we must manage to build up something she and i and her child,let me think i wish i could help you but i thought you wanted to be in town one bit of advice fix your district then fix your price and then don t budge that s how i got both ducie street and oniton i said to myself i mean to be exactly here and i was and oniton s a place in a thousand,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2239,1280,munich we start after the inquest if she is not too ill,no my letter s about howards end bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it i am far from sure that i shall give him permission there was no clause in the agreement in my opinion subletting is a mistake if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement morning schlegel don t you think that s better than subletting,Henry,F,major,,
Margaret,Henry,2241,1230,yes,i must say you re a downright young woman what a question to spring on a fellow,Henry,F,major,,

Henry,Helen,821,870,what s his profession,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Helen,823,1319,what in,a man who had little money has less owing to us under these circumstances i consider the battle of life a happy expression,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Helen,845,1272,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love,good morning mr wilcox,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major

Henry,Helen,1324,846,now a word of advice,human nature i suppose,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Helen,1326,1329,a word of advice don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor see that she doesn t margaret the poor are poor and one s sorry for them but there it is as civilisation moves forward the shoe is bound to pinch in places and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally neither you nor i nor my informant nor the man who informed him nor the directors of the porphyrion are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary it s just the shoe pinching no one can help it and it might easily have been worse by all means subscribe to charities subscribe to them largely but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of social reform i see a good deal behind the scenes and you can take it from me that there is no social question except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase there are just rich and poor as there always have been and always will be point me out a time when men have been equal,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major
Henry,Helen,1328,810,point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier no no you can t there always have been rich and poor i m no fatalist heaven forbid but our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces and there always will be rich and poor you can t deny it and you can t deny that in spite of all the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting,Helen; Margaret,,,F,major

Helen,Henry,813,1322,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs,i wouldn t say that but you re taking it far too seriously who is this fellow,Henry; Margaret,F,major,,
Helen,Henry,815,1310,quickness,no the fellow needn t,Henry; Margaret,F,major,,
Helen,Henry,820,838,but mr wilcox do first light another cigarette it s this we ve just come across a young fellow who s evidently very poor and who seems interest,and how does he clean the boots,Henry; Margaret,F,major,,
Helen,Henry,822,827,clerk,my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed,Henry; Margaret,F,major,,
