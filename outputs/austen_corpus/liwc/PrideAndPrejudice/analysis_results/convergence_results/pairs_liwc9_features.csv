00073,Elizabeth,Mary,82,83,that is very true and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine,pride is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,F,major,F,minor,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00076,Mrs. Bennet,Charlotte Lucas,85,86,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00080,Elizabeth,Charlotte Lucas,89,90,but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out,perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses,Charlotte Lucas,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00401,Mr. Collins,Elizabeth,440,441,you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females,i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart,Elizabeth,M,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00711,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,803,804,i have been thinking it over again elizabeth and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk,do you really think so,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
00712,Elizabeth,Mrs. Gardiner,804,805,do you really think so,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00713,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,805,806,upon my word i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00714,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,806,807,not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
00715,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,807,808,in the first place there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00716,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,808,809,oh but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00717,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,809,810,well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00718,Elizabeth,Mr. Gardiner,810,811,but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,M,minor,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00719,Mr. Gardiner,Elizabeth,811,812,but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,Elizabeth; Mrs. Gardiner,M,minor,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00720,Elizabeth,Mrs. Gardiner,812,813,it does seem and it is most shocking indeed that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00721,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,813,814,but you see that jane does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00722,Elizabeth,Mrs. Gardiner,814,815,of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating,and do you really know all this,Mr. Gardiner; Mrs. Gardiner,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
00723,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,815,816,and do you really know all this,i do indeed i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00725,Mrs. Gardiner,Elizabeth,817,818,but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand,oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts,Elizabeth; Mr. Gardiner,F,intermediate,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
