p00005_A,00005,A,don t let them know they are never to know
p00006_A,00006,A,they do not love any longer if you prefer it put that way
p00007_A,00007,A,i love you
p00008_A,00008,A,do you imply that we germans are stupid uncle ernst
p00009_A,00009,A,you girls are so wonderful in always having oh dear one mustn t talk
p00010_A,00010,A,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p00011_A,00011,A,on the what dear
p00012_A,00012,A,on the drum aunt juley
p00013_A,00013,A,margaret is helen all right
p00014_A,00014,A,oh yes
p00015_A,00015,A,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00016_A,00016,A,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00017_A,00017,A,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00018_A,00018,A,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do
p00019_A,00019,A,it isn t of any consequence
p00020_A,00020,A,but of course it is tibby tibby
p00021_A,00021,A,what what the pomp and circumstance will not be fine
p00022_A,00022,A,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00023_A,00023,A,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00024_A,00024,A,margaret margaret margaret fraulein mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat
p00025_A,00025,A,might i couldn t i
p00026_A,00026,A,oh i would be so grateful
p00027_A,00027,A,but surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low c aunt juley no one could it s unmistakable
p00028_A,00028,A,a specially loud part of course i do not go in for being musical i only care for music a very different thing but still i will say this for myself i do know when i like a thing and when i don t some people are the same about pictures they can go into a picture gallery miss conder can and say straight off what they feel all round the wall i never could do that but music is so different from pictures to my mind when it comes to music i am as safe as houses and i assure you tibby i am by no means pleased by everything there was a thing something about a faun in french which helen went into ecstasies over but i thought it most tinkling and superficial and said so and i held to my opinion too
p00029_A,00029,A,helen you must not be so ramshackly you took this gentleman s umbrella away from queen s hall and he has had the trouble of coming round for it
p00030_A,00030,A,oh i am so sorry i do nothing but steal umbrellas i am so very sorry do come in and choose one is yours a hooky or a nobbly mine s a nobbly at least i think it is
p00031_A,00031,A,don t you see that you ve frightened him away i meant him to stop to tea you oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella i saw his nice eyes getting so miserable no it s not a bit of good now
p00032_A,00032,A,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00033_A,00033,A,aunt juley how can you you make me more and more ashamed i d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that i well i must shut the front door i suppose one more failure for helen
p00034_A,00034,A,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00035_A,00035,A,why he might have stolen the little ricketts picture as well
p00036_A,00036,A,in a way i wish we had a real boy in the house the kind of boy who cares for men it would make entertaining so much easier
p00037_A,00037,A,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p00038_A,00038,A,oh it s no good looking superior i mean what i say
p00039_A,00039,A,leave tibby alone
p00040_A,00040,A,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00041_A,00041,A,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00042_A,00042,A,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00043_A,00043,A,a touch of the w s perhaps
p00044_A,00044,A,who are the w s
p00045_A,00045,A,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00046_A,00046,A,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00047_A,00047,A,that house being the w s house i presume
p00048_A,00048,A,good evening mr bast
p00049_A,00049,A,oh margaret such a most unfortunate thing has happened i could not get you alone coming up no doubt in the hope of getting into london society
p00050_A,00050,A,it is only that a certain family whom we know by name but do not mention as you said yourself last night after the concert have taken the flat opposite from the mathesons where the plants are in the balcony what helen you don t mind them coming do you
p00051_A,00051,A,well you look grave doesn t she frieda
p00052_A,00052,A,i don t feel grave that s all i can say you re going quite on the wrong tack
p00053_A,00053,A,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00054_A,00054,A,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00055_A,00055,A,come helen
p00056_A,00056,A,go helen
p00057_A,00057,A,helen his mother has forgiven you
p00058_A,00058,A,bother the whole family helen stop giggling and pirouetting and go and finish your packing why can t the woman leave us alone
p00059_A,00059,A,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00060_A,00060,A,most certainly her love has died
p00061_A,00061,A,if you are going to germany go and pack if you aren t go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me
p00062_A,00062,A,but meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young o lud who s that coming down the stairs i vow tis my brother o crimini
p00063_A,00063,A,inexperience of course i have everything to learn absolutely everything just as much as helen life s very difficult and full of surprises at all events i ve got as far as that to be humble and kind to go straight ahead to love people rather than pity them to remember the submerged well one can t do all these things at once worse luck because they re so contradictory it s then that proportion comes in to live by proportion don t begin with proportion only prigs do that let proportion come in as a last resource when the better things have failed and a deadlock gracious me i ve started preaching
p00064_A,00064,A,indeed you put the difficulties of life splendidly it is just what i should have liked to say about them myself
p00065_A,00065,A,indeed that sounds like a most beautiful view miss schlegel
p00066_A,00066,A,yes yes the german is always on the lookout for beauty he may miss it through stupidity or misinterpret it but he is always asking beauty to enter his life and i believe that in the end it will come at heidelberg i met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry so easy for me to laugh i who never repeat poetry good or bad and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with my blood boils well i m half german so put it down to patriotism when i listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things teutonic whether they re bocklin or my veterinary surgeon oh bocklin they say he strains after beauty he peoples nature with gods too consciously of course bocklin strains because he wants something beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world so his landscapes don t come off and leader s do
p00067_A,00067,A,i am not sure that i agree do you
p00068_A,00068,A,i have no side but my husband has very little faith in the continent and our children have all taken after him
p00069_A,00069,A,on what grounds do they feel that the continent is in bad form
p00070_A,00070,A,never mind us or her do say
p00071_A,00071,A,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00072_A,00072,A,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00073_A,00073,A,i don t know i don t know
p00074_A,00074,A,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00075_A,00075,A,my husband and our daughter are motoring
p00076_A,00076,A,bertha too oh fancy what a coincidence do you know i ll wait on second thoughts i ll wait there s plenty of time still isn t there and i shall be able to get evie s opinion
p00077_A,00077,A,later on i should love it but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition and we ought to start when we re fresh isn t the house shut up too might i come some other day
p00078_A,00078,A,back to wickham place please
p00079_A,00079,A,no motor smash changed plans father s coming
p00080_A,00080,A,miss schlegel our little outing must be for another day
p00081_A,00081,A,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00082_A,00082,A,but as we ve insured against third party risks it won t so much matter
p00083_A,00083,A,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00084_A,00084,A,i didn t want to henry i might have been wrong and every one hates illnesses
p00085_A,00085,A,father s eaten nothing
p00086_A,00086,A,butter dolly
p00087_A,00087,A,then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded
p00088_A,00088,A,one minute i m busy well crane who s been driving it do you suppose
p00089_A,00089,A,don t know i m sure sir no one s driven it since i ve been back but of course there s the fortnight i ve been away with the other car in yorkshire
p00090_A,00090,A,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00091_A,00091,A,i can t of course say for the time i ve been in yorkshire no more mud now sir
p00092_A,00092,A,she wants howards end
p00093_A,00093,A,no sir
p00094_A,00094,A,howards end
p00095_A,00095,A,dolly go back at once my father s much annoyed with you charles come in at once to father he s had a letter that s too awful
p00096_A,00096,A,oh mr wilcox
p00097_A,00097,A,come evie don t waste time sit down
p00098_A,00098,A,a note in my mother s handwriting in an envelope addressed to my father sealed inside no date no signature forwarded through the matron of that nursing home now the question is
p00099_A,00099,A,why it s only in pencil i said so pencil never counts
p00100_A,00100,A,that she would have that it is a case of undue influence no to my mind the question is the the invalid s condition at the time she wrote
p00101_A,00101,A,why you just said it was
p00102_A,00102,A,never mind if i did and hold your tongue
p00103_A,00103,A,mother believed so in ancestors too it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider who d never appreciate
p00104_A,00104,A,presumably she knows mother will have told her she got twice or three times into the nursing home presumably she is awaiting developments
p00105_A,00105,A,what a horrid woman
p00106_A,00106,A,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00107_A,00107,A,that paul business was pretty scandalous though
p00108_A,00108,A,i want no more of the paul business charles as i said at the time and besides it is quite apart from this business margaret schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week and we have all suffered under her but upon my soul she s honest she s not in collusion with the matron i m absolutely certain of it nor was she with the doctor i m equally certain of that she did not hide anything from us for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are she like ourselves was a dupe you see charles in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions paul would not have left england you would not have gone to italy nor evie and i into yorkshire if only we had known well miss schlegel s position has been equally false take all in all she has not come out of it badly
p00109_A,00109,A,but those chrysanthemums
p00110_A,00110,A,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00111_A,00111,A,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00112_A,00112,A,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00113_A,00113,A,i hope charles took the hint
p00114_A,00114,A,yes that is to say her husband wrote later on and thanked me for being a little kind to her and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette don t you think that is extraordinarily generous it has made me like him very much he hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance but that you and i will go and stop with evie some time in the future i like mr wilcox he is taking up his work rubber it is a big business i gather he is launching out rather charles is in it too charles is married a pretty little creature but she doesn t seem wise they took on the flat but now they have gone off to a house of their own
p00115_A,00115,A,but what an extraordinary
p00116_A,00116,A,i hope you were pleased
p00117_A,00117,A,tibby had better first wonder what he ll do cheers children it s mrs lanoline
p00118_A,00118,A,it was a concert at the queen s hall i think you will recollect when i tell you that it included a performance of the fifth symphony of beethoven
p00119_A,00119,A,we hear the fifth practically every time it s done so i m not sure do you remember helen
p00120_A,00120,A,likely enough for i steal umbrellas even oftener than i hear beethoven did you get it back
p00121_A,00121,A,the lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too and that she could find you
p00122_A,00122,A,this afternoon call
p00123_A,00123,A,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00124_A,00124,A,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00125_A,00125,A,it was good of you to come and explain the rest is naturally no concern of ours
p00126_A,00126,A,don t talk to me about the pole star i know its little ways it goes round and round and you go round after it
p00127_A,00127,A,but not good country there is it
p00128_A,00128,A,did you actually go off the roads
p00129_A,00129,A,oh yes i always meant to go off the roads but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way
p00130_A,00130,A,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00131_A,00131,A,excuse me mr bast but you re wrong there it didn t it came from something far greater
p00132_A,00132,A,then you don t think i was foolish
p00133_A,00133,A,heavens no
p00134_A,00134,A,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00135_A,00135,A,oh bother not to say dash i had forgotten we were dining out but do do come round again and have a talk
p00136_A,00136,A,why better
p00137_A,00137,A,i know but people don t go then perhaps you know best but never forget you re better than jefferies
p00138_A,00138,A,len who s miss schlegel
p00139_A,00139,A,have i i thought i had a million
p00140_A,00140,A,oh we ve had a splendid evening we belong to a kind of club that reads papers margaret and i all women but there is a discussion after this evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money whether to one s family or to the poor and if so how oh most interesting
p00141_A,00141,A,sounds a most original entertainment i wish evie would go to that sort of thing but she hasn t the time she s taken to breeding aberdeen terriers jolly little dogs
p00142_A,00142,A,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00143_A,00143,A,yes quickness in argument time after time i ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and i haven t oh i believe in these discussions oh yes it doesn t much matter what subject you take
p00144_A,00144,A,about mr bast yes do he ll be more lenient to a special case
p00145_A,00145,A,what in
p00146_A,00146,A,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00147_A,00147,A,naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance is in a stronger position that the man who isn t it looks as if he s worth something i know by myself this is letting you into the state secrets it affects an employer greatly human nature i m afraid
p00148_A,00148,A,i hadn t thought of that
p00149_A,00149,A,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00150_A,00150,A,i advise nothing i oughtn t to have spoken but i happen to know being more or less behind the scenes the porphyrion s a bad bad concern now don t say i said so it s outside the tariff ring
p00151_A,00151,A,certainly i won t say in fact i don t know what that means
p00152_A,00152,A,human nature i suppose
p00153_A,00153,A,oh we ve got a splendid tenant hamar bryce an invalid if charles ever wanted it but he won t dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences no we have all decided against howards end we like it in a way but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other one must have one thing or the other
p00154_A,00154,A,and mine
p00155_A,00155,A,next september
p00156_A,00156,A,every one moving good bye
p00157_A,00157,A,do yes that s worth doing let us
p00158_A,00158,A,ladies brighten
p00159_A,00159,A,yes i know the darlings are regular sunbeams let me give you a plate
p00160_A,00160,A,your company is the porphyrion isn t it
p00161_A,00161,A,yes that s so it s funny how things get round
p00162_A,00162,A,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00163_A,00163,A,i couldn t say some would tell you one thing and others another for my own part i only believe half i hear not that even it s safer those clever ones come to the worse grief i ve often noticed ah you can t be too careful
p00164_A,00164,A,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00165_A,00165,A,i mean i wouldn t say he s right altogether
p00166_A,00166,A,then he is right partly mr bast i don t understand business and i dare say my questions are stupid but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong our friend who is also a business man was so positive he said before christmas
p00167_A,00167,A,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00168_A,00168,A,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00169_A,00169,A,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00170_A,00170,A,we brought the little fellows round
p00171_A,00171,A,i bred em myself
p00172_A,00172,A,i ve got to be going now
p00173_A,00173,A,but play with puppies a little first
p00174_A,00174,A,this is ahab that s jezebel
p00175_A,00175,A,i ve got to be going
p00176_A,00176,A,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p00177_A,00177,A,to help you you silly boy and don t shout
p00178_A,00178,A,highly unfair

p00180_A,00180,A,of course if there s been any misunderstanding all i can do is to go but i beg to state you were picking my brain for official information i can prove it i
p00181_A,00181,A,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand

p00183_A,00183,A,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p00184_A,00184,A,oh yes
p00185_A,00185,A,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me

p00193_A,00193,A,he s very clever isn t he
p00194_A,00194,A,he s gone with my blessing and now for puppies
p00195_A,00195,A,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls

p00203_A,00203,A,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00204_A,00204,A,there s nothing rash to do
p00205_A,00205,A,who are the wilcoxes
p00206_A,00206,A,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00207_A,00207,A,it will be as easy as eating
p00208_A,00208,A,i was thinking of father how could he settle to leave germany as he did when he had fought for it as a young man and all his feelings and friends were prussian how could he break loose with patriotism and begin aiming at something else it would have killed me when he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals and we at our age can t change houses it s humiliating
p00209_A,00209,A,bungle my dear you are too little to recollect in fact you weren t there but the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for wickham place was signed and emily took train with baby who was margaret then and the smaller luggage for london without so much as knowing where her new home would be getting away from that house may be hard but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it
p00210_A,00210,A,and that s the man who beat the austrians and the danes and the french and who beat the germans that were inside himself and we re like him
p00211_A,00211,A,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00212_A,00212,A,no frau liesecke but that is because they are fresh water and different salt water ought to have tides and go up and down a great deal or else it smells look for instance at an aquarium
p00213_A,00213,A,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00214_A,00214,A,yes that is so
p00215_A,00215,A,i hope she hasn t been hasty
p00216_A,00216,A,but sister to that paul
p00217_A,00217,A,i had too much to do dear to look at it i had everything to settle and explain and charles wilcox to keep in his place besides it isn t likely i should remember much i just remember having lunch in your bedroom
p00218_A,00218,A,the great wilcox peril will never return if i m certain of anything it s of that
p00219_A,00219,A,one is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions
p00220_A,00220,A,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p00221_A,00221,A,not exactly
p00222_A,00222,A,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00223_A,00223,A,wait one minute
p00224_A,00224,A,but you ve never conceivably you ve never
p00225_A,00225,A,panic and emptiness don t

p00228_A,00228,A,good morning mr wilcox
p00229_A,00229,A,not a bad business
p00230_A,00230,A,no my letter s about howards end bryce has been ordered abroad and wants to sublet it i am far from sure that i shall give him permission there was no clause in the agreement in my opinion subletting is a mistake if he can find me another tenant whom i consider suitable i may cancel the agreement morning schlegel don t you think that s better than subletting
p00231_A,00231,A,it s all right dempster s bank s better
p00232_A,00232,A,no the fellow needn t
p00233_A,00233,A,he only says reduced
p00234_A,00234,A,with a man so poor every reduction must be great i consider it a deplorable misfortune
p00235_A,00235,A,you re ridiculous helen
p00236_A,00236,A,owing to god i suppose you grab the dollars god does the rest
p00237_A,00237,A,because i m an old maid i can t think why i go on like this myself
p00238_A,00238,A,but going away without taking the weymouth trip or even the lulworth without going once more up nine barrows down
p00239_A,00239,A,good i did the breaking of the ice
p00240_A,00240,A,one minute
p00241_A,00241,A,i shall enjoy seeing it
p00242_A,00242,A,you ll see it at its worst for bryce decamped abroad last monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him i never saw such a disgraceful mess it s unbelievable he wasn t in the house a month
p00243_A,00243,A,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce
p00244_A,00244,A,invalid type couldn t sleep
p00245_A,00245,A,poor fellow
p00246_A,00246,A,quite right
p00247_A,00247,A,dolly would have taken them but i was in fortunately
p00248_A,00248,A,what s mr bryce like
p00249_A,00249,A,now we ll be off
p00250_A,00250,A,yes but while they re learning
p00251_A,00251,A,the motor s come to stay one must get about there s a pretty church oh you aren t sharp enough well look out if the road worries you right outward at the scenery
p00252_A,00252,A,in fancy of course in fancy you had her way of walking good day
p00253_A,00253,A,it gave her quite a turn none of you girls have any nerves really of course a word from me put it all right but silly old miss avery she frightened you didn t she margaret there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds she might have said something instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on i passed her as i came in enough to make the car shy i believe miss avery goes in for being a character some old maids do it is their last resource heaven knows what she was doing in the place but that s bryce s business not mine
p00254_A,00254,A,did you take her for a spook
p00255_A,00255,A,she s just one of the crew at the farm people like that always assume things she assumed you d know who she was she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby and assumed that you d seen them as you came in that you d lock up the house when you d done and would bring them on down to her and there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm lack of education makes people very casual hilton was full of women like miss avery once
p00256_A,00256,A,i shouldn t have disliked it perhaps
p00257_A,00257,A,i say howards end howards ended i m rather on the spot this evening eh
p00258_A,00258,A,oh mr wilcox how can you

p00264_A,00264,A,i expect a little of will be more to the point than one of us
p00265_A,00265,A,you should have thought of that sooner charles
p00266_A,00266,A,there it s only a rotten cat
p00267_A,00267,A,yes madam the girl will receive compensation for it
p00268_A,00268,A,she was a very ruda girla
p00269_A,00269,A,wouldn t you have been rude
p00270_A,00270,A,oh henry i have been so naughty we ran over a cat charles told me not to jump out but i would and look your poor meg went such a flop
p00271_A,00271,A,thinking it was a dog

p00278_A,00278,A,how do you do mr bast this is an odd business what view do you take of it
p00279_A,00279,A,there is mrs bast too
p00280_A,00280,A,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p00281_A,00281,A,whether we could get him back into the porphyrion again meg this has been a cheerful business a bright evening s work that was on chelsea embankment
p00282_A,00282,A,that s right
p00283_A,00283,A,and went into a bank instead
p00284_A,00284,A,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p00285_A,00285,A,i hate all this
p00286_A,00286,A,i brought them i did it all
p00287_A,00287,A,i can only advise you to go at once my sister has put you in a false position and it is kindest to tell you so it s too late to get to town but you ll find a comfortable hotel in oniton where mrs bast can rest and i hope you ll be my guests there
p00288_A,00288,A,it s work he wants can t you see
p00289_A,00289,A,you don t know what you re talking about i shall never get work now if rich people fail at one profession they can try another not i i had my groove and i ve got out of it i could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary but that s all poetry s nothing miss schlegel one s thoughts about this and that are nothing your money too is nothing if you ll understand me i mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job it s all over with him i have seen it happen to others their friends gave them money for a little but in the end they fall over the edge it s no good it s the whole world pulling there always will be rich and poor
p00290_A,00290,A,won t you have something to eat i don t know what to do it isn t my house and though mr wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time as i say i don t know what to do but i undertake to do what i can for you helen offer them something do try a sandwich mrs bast

p00300_A,00300,A,i don t expect there s much to forgive
p00301_A,00301,A,but she s only a farm woman
p00302_A,00302,A,yes mrs wilcox no mrs wilcox oh yes mrs wilcox auntie received your letter quite duly auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment shall i send the servant to direct you of course auntie does not generally look after your place she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional it gives her something to do she spends quite a lot of her time there my husband says to me sometimes i say yes mrs wilcox mrs wilcox could i prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake not if i cut it for you i cannot let you go on alone now don t you really mustn t i will direct you myself if it comes to that i must get my hat now mrs wilcox don t you move while i m gone

p00308_A,00308,A,yes mrs wilcox of course
p00309_A,00309,A,i hope miss avery is not ill
p00310_A,00310,A,well if you ll excuse me perhaps i ought to be leaving you now the servants need seeing to at the farm auntie is so odd at times
p00311_A,00311,A,certainly mrs wilcox
p00312_A,00312,A,that is what we all say but why should it be just like helen why should she be allowed to be so queer and to grow queerer
p00313_A,00313,A,i don t suppose i ever shall
p00314_A,00314,A,come in charles could you help us at all we are again in trouble
p00315_A,00315,A,i m afraid i cannot what are the facts we are all mad more or less you know in these days
p00316_A,00316,A,the facts are as follows the facts are that she has been in england for three days and will not see us she has forbidden the bankers to give us her address she refuses to answer questions margaret finds her letters colourless there are other facts but these are the most striking
p00317_A,00317,A,it s quite impossible
p00318_A,00318,A,but helen doesn t talk that s our whole difficulty she won t talk your particular language and on that account you think she s ill
p00319_A,00319,A,not in that way
p00320_A,00320,A,i cannot make it out
p00321_A,00321,A,yes margaret you know you must take plenty
p00322_A,00322,A,have i time
p00323_A,00323,A,yes plenty
p00324_A,00324,A,i was just saying to my wife mansbridge that our main object is not to frighten miss schlegel the house as you know is my property so it should seem quite natural for us to be there the trouble is evidently nervous wouldn t you say so margaret
p00325_A,00325,A,she always was highly strung a tendency to spiritualism and those things though nothing serious musical literary artistic but i should say normal a very charming girl
p00326_A,00326,A,i can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish
p00327_A,00327,A,forgive me but i will not
p00328_A,00328,A,this business is as broad as it s long we had better all work together you need us mrs wilcox and we need you
p00329_A,00329,A,please lady a message
p00330_A,00330,A,yes please
p00331_A,00331,A,but i like milk why send it away

p00340_A,00340,A,i think i ll go round to the police station
p00341_A,00341,A,what for
p00342_A,00342,A,no one ever told the lad he ll have a child
p00343_A,00343,A,he didn t say madam
p00344_A,00344,A,no my dear manslaughter manslaughter charles may go to prison i dare not tell him i don t know what to do what to do i m broken i m ended
p00345_A,00345,A,yes please
p00346_A,00346,A,the conclave s breaking at last i ll go
p00347_A,00347,A,yes i did
p00348_A,00348,A,as i ve given up the outdoor life that suited me and i have come home to look after the business it s no good my settling down here it s not really the country and it s not the town
p00349_A,00349,A,of course father
p00350_A,00350,A,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p00351_A,00351,A,then i leave howards end to my wife absolutely and let everyone understand that and after i am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise in consequence i leave my wife no money that is her own wish all that she would have had will be divided among you i am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime so that you may be independent of me that is her wish too she also is giving away a great deal of money she intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew down in the field is all that clear does everyone understand
p00352_A,00352,A,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
p00353_A,00353,A,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p00354_A,00354,A,good bye mr wilcox it does seem curious that mrs wilcox should have left margaret howards end and yet she get it after all

p00006_B,00006,B,why be so polite to servants they don t understand it
p00007_B,00007,B,it was over at once
p00008_B,00008,B,papa why will they not discuss this most clear question to me one of two things is very clear either god does not know his own mind about england and germany or else these do not know the mind of god
p00009_B,00009,B,now comes the wonderful movement first of all the goblins and then a trio of elephants dancing
p00010_B,00010,B,on the drum aunt juley
p00011_B,00011,B,no look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back
p00012_B,00012,B,margaret is helen all right
p00013_B,00013,B,she is always going away in the middle of a programme
p00014_B,00014,B,the music has evidently moved her deeply
p00015_B,00015,B,excuse me but that lady has quite inadvertently taken my umbrella
p00016_B,00016,B,oh good gracious me i am so sorry tibby run after helen
p00017_B,00017,B,i shall miss the four serious songs if i do

p00019_B,00019,B,my sister is so careless
p00020_B,00020,B,not at all
p00021_B,00021,B,for my part i have heard the composition at stettin on two occasions it is dramatic a little
p00022_B,00022,B,we have this call to pay in finsbury circus it is true
p00023_B,00023,B,oh what a bother what a family we are fr frieda but it s the number they want in finsbury circus
p00024_B,00024,B,might i couldn t i
p00025_B,00025,B,we live quite near i am going there now could you walk round with me and we ll find your umbrella
p00026_B,00026,B,thank you
p00027_B,00027,B,do you agree do you think music is so different from pictures
p00028_B,00028,B,i i should have thought so kind of
p00029_B,00029,B,don t you talk meg you stole an old gentleman s silk top hat yes she did aunt juley it is a positive fact she thought it was a muff oh heavens i ve knocked the in and out card down where s frieda tibby why don t you ever no i can t remember what i was going to say that wasn t it but do tell the maids to hurry tea up what about this umbrella no it s all gone along the seams it s an appalling umbrella it must be mine
p00030_B,00030,B,but if you will stop now helen how stupid you ve been
p00031_B,00031,B,i dare say it is all for the best we know nothing about the young man margaret and your drawing room is full of very tempting little things
p00032_B,00032,B,yes i think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent you remember rent it was one of father s words rent to the ideal to his own faith in human nature you remember how he would trust strangers and if they fooled him he would say it s better to be fooled than to be suspicious that the confidence trick is the work of man but the want of confidence trick is the work of the devil
p00033_B,00033,B,i remember something of the sort now
p00034_B,00034,B,it was lucky that your father married a wife with money
p00035_B,00035,B,no i agree with aunt juley i d rather mistrust people than lose my little ricketts there are limits
p00036_B,00036,B,why didn t you make that young man welcome tibby you must do the host a little you know you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women
p00037_B,00037,B,leave tibby alone
p00038_B,00038,B,here s the house a regular hen coop
p00039_B,00039,B,oh my dear how can you say such dreadful things the number of men you get here has always astonished me if there is any danger it s the other way round
p00040_B,00040,B,yes but it s the wrong sort of men helen means
p00041_B,00041,B,no i don t we get the right sort of man but the wrong side of him and i say that s tibby s fault there ought to be a something about the house an i don t know what
p00042_B,00042,B,who are the w s
p00043_B,00043,B,the w s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about and you don t so there
p00044_B,00044,B,i suppose that ours is a female house and one must just accept it no aunt juley i don t mean that this house is full of women i am trying to say something much more clever i mean that it was irrevocably feminine even in father s time now i m sure you understand well i ll give you another example it ll shock you but i don t care suppose queen victoria gave a dinner party and that the guests had been leighton millais swinburne rossetti meredith fitzgerald etc do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic heavens no the very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that so with our house it must be feminine and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate just as another house that i can mention but won t sounded irrevocably masculine and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal
p00045_B,00045,B,that house being the w s house i presume
p00046_B,00046,B,you re not going to be told about the w s my child so don t you think it and on the other hand i don t the least mind if you find out so don t you think you ve done anything clever in either case give me a cigarette
p00047_B,00047,B,you do what you can for the house the drawing room reeks of smoke
p00048_B,00048,B,what ho
p00049_B,00049,B,oh but helen isn t a girl with no interests she has plenty of other things and other people to think about she made a false start with the wilcoxes and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them
p00050_B,00050,B,i m not grave
p00051_B,00051,B,no she does not feel grave i can bear witness to that she disagrees
p00052_B,00052,B,hark i hear bruno entering the hall
p00053_B,00053,B,did you say the mathesons flat aunt juley how wonderful you are i never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was matheson
p00054_B,00054,B,go helen
p00055_B,00055,B,helen cannot deceive me she does mind
p00056_B,00056,B,oh hush frieda ll hear you and she can be so tiresome
p00057_B,00057,B,i don t know what i shall do with meg she s got wilcox and box upon the brain meg meg i don t love the young gentleman i don t love the young gentleman meg meg can a body speak plainer
p00058_B,00058,B,most certainly her love has died
p00059_B,00059,B,most certainly it has frieda but that will not prevent me from being bored with the wilcoxes if i return the call
p00060_B,00060,B,oh boo hoo boo hoo hoo meg s going to return the call and i can t cos why cos i m going to german eye
p00061_B,00061,B,it is all right she does not love the young man he has not been worthy of her

p00065_B,00065,B,what do the overhanging warehouses make of that
p00066_B,00066,B,i think miss schlegel puts everything splendidly
p00067_B,00067,B,oh mrs wilcox say something nicer than that it s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly
p00068_B,00068,B,you will admit though that the continent it seems silly to speak of the continent but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like england england is unique do have another jelly first i was going to say that the continent for good or for evil is interested in ideas its literature and art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them and this persists even through decadence and affectation there is more liberty of action in england but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic prussia people will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs
p00069_B,00069,B,i do not want to go to prussia not even to see that interesting view that you were describing and for discussing with humility i am too old we never discuss anything at howards end
p00070_B,00070,B,one admits that the arguments against the suffrage are extraordinarily strong
p00071_B,00071,B,we didn t mean the vote though did we aren t we differing on something much wider mrs wilcox whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history or whether since men have moved forward so far they too may move forward a little now i say they may i would even admit a biological change
p00072_B,00072,B,i must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse they ve turned disgracefully strict
p00073_B,00073,B,oh but come upstairs for a little miss quested plays do you like macdowell do you mind his only having two noises if you must really go i ll see you out won t you even have coffee
p00074_B,00074,B,what an interesting life you all lead in london

p00076_B,00076,B,i beg your pardon
p00077_B,00077,B,a thousand thanks miss schlegel for all your help
p00078_B,00078,B,not at all
p00079_B,00079,B,oh henry dear here s a lovely surprise but let me introduce but i think you know miss schlegel
p00080_B,00080,B,another day mrs wilcox of course
p00081_B,00081,B,cart and car being practically at right angles
p00082_B,00082,B,henry why do people who have enough money try to get more money i am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet there would be no more wars a more inward light not so much for myself as for baby
p00083_B,00083,B,why didn t you tell me you knew of it
p00084_B,00084,B,thanks put it down
p00085_B,00085,B,he s going to read his letters first i think i dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards they had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday
p00086_B,00086,B,yes dear
p00087_B,00087,B,yes rather you must complain to chalkeley
p00088_B,00088,B,charles your father s down something s happened he wants you in the house at once oh charles
p00089_B,00089,B,wait dear wait a minute who had the key of the garage while you were away crane
p00090_B,00090,B,the gardener sir
p00091_B,00091,B,she wants howards end
p00092_B,00092,B,no sir
p00093_B,00093,B,but you haven t listened charles
p00094_B,00094,B,schlegels again
p00095_B,00095,B,oh no the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her
p00096_B,00096,B,i suppose we re going to have a talk about this
p00097_B,00097,B,but i say that note isn t legal houses ought to be done by a lawyer charles surely
p00098_B,00098,B,give it her
p00099_B,00099,B,the question is the question is whether miss schlegel during the fortnight we were all away whether she unduly
p00100_B,00100,B,why you just said it was
p00101_B,00101,B,ah well i shouldn t have thought it possible
p00102_B,00102,B,mother couldn t have meant it
p00103_B,00103,B,that time may prove
p00104_B,00104,B,why she may be coming down to turn us out now
p00105_B,00105,B,i wish she would i could then deal with her
p00106_B,00106,B,so could i i could deal with her if she comes but she won t come you re all a bit hard on miss schlegel
p00107_B,00107,B,but those chrysanthemums
p00108_B,00108,B,or coming down to the funeral at all
p00109_B,00109,B,why shouldn t she come down she had the right to and she stood far back among the hilton women the flowers certainly we should not have sent such flowers but they may have seemed the right thing to her evie and for all you know they may be the custom in germany
p00110_B,00110,B,oh i forget she isn t really english that would explain a lot
p00111_B,00111,B,she s a cosmopolitan i admit i m rather down on cosmopolitans my fault doubtless i cannot stand them and a german cosmopolitan is the limit i think that s about all isn t it i want to run down and see chalkeley a bicycle will do and by the way i wish you d speak to crane some time i m certain he s had my new car out
p00112_B,00112,B,has he done it any harm
p00113_B,00113,B,i was thinking of mr vyse he never strikes me as particularly happy
p00114_B,00114,B,ye es
p00115_B,00115,B,i hope you were pleased
p00116_B,00116,B,but how on earth
p00117_B,00117,B,no i can t say i do
p00118_B,00118,B,was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade then i don t remember that s the only beethoven i ever remember specially
p00119_B,00119,B,and you if i may say so took away my umbrella inadvertently of course
p00120_B,00120,B,the mistake arose out of my card did it
p00121_B,00121,B,then why
p00122_B,00122,B,saturday afternoon or sunday afternoon
p00123_B,00123,B,really and you were still calling on sunday when your wife came here a long visit
p00124_B,00124,B,oh don t let us mind
p00125_B,00125,B,no doubt it s another beautiful book but i d rather hear about your road
p00126_B,00126,B,where did you start from do tell us more
p00127_B,00127,B,yes go on
p00128_B,00128,B,mr bast you re a born adventurer no professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done it s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck whatever did your wife say
p00129_B,00129,B,professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses besides they can t walk it tires them go on
p00130_B,00130,B,i felt like r l s you probably remember how in virginibus
p00131_B,00131,B,heavens no
p00132_B,00132,B,heaven help us if we do
p00133_B,00133,B,i m very glad you say that now my wife would never understand not if i explained for days
p00134_B,00134,B,you ve not been content to dream as we have
p00135_B,00135,B,no i shall not it s better like this
p00136_B,00136,B,that s rather a sad view of life surely
p00137_B,00137,B,yes don t you wish you knew what that card was
p00138_B,00138,B,well i know where you ve been but you don t know where i ve been
p00139_B,00139,B,but that would be pauperising them
p00140_B,00140,B,i expect we d better be doing the same really
p00141_B,00141,B,we pretend we re improving ourselves you see we suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate but as my sister says it may be better to breed dogs
p00142_B,00142,B,not at all i don t agree with your sister there s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness i often wish i had gone in for them when i was a youngster it would have helped me no end
p00143_B,00143,B,no i won t go on i ll just put our special case to mr wilcox
p00144_B,00144,B,what s his profession
p00145_B,00145,B,porphyrion fire insurance company
p00146_B,00146,B,my dear miss schlegel i will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread i will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested my only contribution is this let your young friend clear out of the porphyrion fire insurance company with all possible speed
p00147_B,00147,B,our human nature appears to be the other way round we employ people because they re unemployed the boot man for instance
p00148_B,00148,B,and how does he clean the boots
p00149_B,00149,B,not well
p00150_B,00150,B,i thought an insurance company never smashed don t the others always run in and save them
p00151_B,00151,B,you re thinking of reinsurance it is exactly there that the porphyrion is weak it has tried to undercut has been badly hit by a long series of small fires and it hasn t been able to reinsure i m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love
p00152_B,00152,B,and how s howards end looking
p00153_B,00153,B,and mine
p00154_B,00154,B,you too on the move
p00155_B,00155,B,what a prosperous vulgarian mr wilcox has grown i have very little use for him in these days however he did tell us about the porphyrion let us write to mr bast as soon as ever we get home and tell him to clear out of it at once
p00156_B,00156,B,do yes that s worth doing let us
p00157_B,00157,B,cake the big cake or the little deadlies i m afraid you thought my letter rather odd but we ll explain we aren t odd really nor affected really we re over expressive that s all
p00158_B,00158,B,how do you like your work
p00159_B,00159,B,oh well enough
p00160_B,00160,B,why funny it was written as large as life on your card and considering we wrote to you there and that you replied on the stamped paper
p00161_B,00161,B,would you call the porphyrion one of the big insurance companies
p00162_B,00162,B,it depends on what you call big
p00163_B,00163,B,we were told the porphyrion s no go we wanted to tell you that s why we wrote
p00164_B,00164,B,you can tell your friend that he s quite wrong
p00165_B,00165,B,and advised you to clear out of it but i don t see why he should know better than you do
p00166_B,00166,B,one can but see as ibsen says things happen
p00167_B,00167,B,so you like carlyle
p00168_B,00168,B,oh the dears oh evie how too impossibly sweet
p00169_B,00169,B,i bred em myself
p00170_B,00170,B,oh really mr bast come and play with puppies
p00171_B,00171,B,i ve got to be going now
p00172_B,00172,B,this is ahab that s jezebel
p00173_B,00173,B,i ve got to be going
p00174_B,00174,B,mr wilcox mr ba must you be really good bye
p00175_B,00175,B,come again
p00176_B,00176,B,no i shan t i knew it would be a failure
p00177_B,00177,B,are we intruding miss schlegel can we be of any use or shall we go
p00178_B,00178,B,you you you you are the man who tried to walk by the pole star you saw the sunrise you tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all away past books and houses to the truth you were looking for a real home
p00179_B,00179,B,can i help you now may i have one quiet word with him in the hall
p00180_B,00180,B,helen go after him do anything anything to make the noodle understand
p00181_B,00181,B,i would have chimed in but i felt that you could polish him off for yourselves i didn t interfere you were splendid miss schlegel absolutely splendid you can take my word for it but there are very few women who could have managed him
p00182_B,00182,B,oh yes
p00183_B,00183,B,bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me
p00184_B,00184,B,yes indeed all that part about mechanical cheerfulness oh fine
p00185_B,00185,B,i m very sorry he s a nice creature really i cannot think what set him off it has been most unpleasant for you
p00186_B,00186,B,ye es
p00187_B,00187,B,naughty young man
p00188_B,00188,B,he has apparently got them
p00189_B,00189,B,yes indeed father
p00190_B,00190,B,he was tramping in surrey if you mean that
p00191_B,00191,B,m m m m
p00192_B,00192,B,he s very clever isn t he
p00193_B,00193,B,she is very young to undertake this sort of thing
p00194_B,00194,B,helen s right enough but i can t stand the toothy one and i shouldn t have called either of them girls
p00195_B,00195,B,i thought i d get round if i could evie told me of her little plan so i just slipped in and secured a table always secure a table first evie don t pretend you want to sit by your old father because you don t miss schlegel come in my side out of pity my goodness but you look tired been worrying round after your young clerks
p00196_B,00196,B,i want a new home in september and some one must find it i can t
p00197_B,00197,B,i can t say i do
p00198_B,00198,B,next time you shall come to lunch with me at mr eustace miles s
p00199_B,00199,B,with pleasure
p00200_B,00200,B,i needn t but hadn t i better it s really getting rather serious we let chance after chance slip and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street we don t know what we want that s the mischief with us
p00201_B,00201,B,no we have no real ties
p00202_B,00202,B,but you won t do anything rash margaret
p00203_B,00203,B,who are the wilcoxes
p00204_B,00204,B,i don t manage the wilcoxes i don t see where they come in
p00205_B,00205,B,no more do i it s funny that we just don t lose sight of them out of all our hotel acquaintances mr wilcox is the only one who has stuck it is now over three years and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time
p00206_B,00206,B,interesting people don t get one houses
p00207_B,00207,B,your father may have been able to change countries and that may or may not be a good thing but he could change houses no better than you can in fact much worse never shall i forget what poor emily suffered in the move from manchester
p00208_B,00208,B,i knew it i told you so it is the little things one bungles at the big real ones are nothing when they come
p00209_B,00209,B,speak for yourself remember that i am cosmopolitan please
p00210_B,00210,B,helen may be right
p00211_B,00211,B,of course she s right
p00212_B,00212,B,you are not to say stink at least you may say it but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it
p00213_B,00213,B,there always has been mud in poole harbour the rivers bring it down and a most valuable oyster fishery depends upon it
p00214_B,00214,B,aunt juley wouldn t that be meg s train

p00219_B,00219,B,have you got the house oh what a nuisance so we re as we were
p00220_B,00220,B,some mystery we are to be enlightened presently
p00221_B,00221,B,it s just like a widower they ve cheek enough for anything and invariably select one of their first wife s friends that type meg not anything wrong with you

p00223_B,00223,B,tibby hurry up through i can t hold this gate indefinitely aunt juley i say aunt juley make the tea will you and frieda we ve got to talk houses and will come on afterwards

p00228_B,00228,B,i have had a letter too not a nice one i want to talk it over with you
p00229_B,00229,B,when there is a sublet i find that damage
p00230_B,00230,B,do excuse me but about the porphyrion i don t feel easy might i just bother you henry you said on chelsea embankment surely that it was a bad concern so we advised this clerk to clear out he writes this morning that he s taken our advice and now you say it s not a bad concern
p00231_B,00231,B,did i it was still outside the tariff ring and had to take rotten policies lately it came in safe as houses now
p00232_B,00232,B,he only says reduced
p00233_B,00233,B,what what s that do you mean that i m responsible
p00234_B,00234,B,you re ridiculous helen
p00235_B,00235,B,is that your point a man who had little money has less that s mine
p00236_B,00236,B,don t ever discuss political economy with henry it ll only end in a cry
p00237_B,00237,B,not want but there is so much to be settled and i do want to see the charles s
p00238_B,00238,B,good i did the breaking of the ice
p00239_B,00239,B,oh helen am i will it be as dreadful for poor henry as all that
p00240_B,00240,B,i shall enjoy seeing it
p00241_B,00241,B,i ve more than a little bone to pick with bryce
p00242_B,00242,B,why did he go so suddenly
p00243_B,00243,B,invalid type couldn t sleep
p00244_B,00244,B,poor fiddlesticks he had the impudence to put up notice boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave charles flung them down
p00245_B,00245,B,yes i flung them down
p00246_B,00246,B,what s mr bryce like
p00247_B,00247,B,now we ll be off
p00248_B,00248,B,they re all right they ll learn like the swallows and the telegraph wires
p00249_B,00249,B,yes but while they re learning
p00250_B,00250,B,kiss them now and come away
p00251_B,00251,B,what s happened
p00252_B,00252,B,i wasn t as foolish as you suggest she only startled me for the house had been silent so long
p00253_B,00253,B,did you take her for a spook
p00254_B,00254,B,she really did frighten you poor margaret and very naturally uneducated classes are so stupid
p00255_B,00255,B,or miss avery giving me a wedding present but charles said i must try not to mind because she had known his grandmother
p00256_B,00256,B,as usual you ve got the story wrong my good dorothea
p00257_B,00257,B,oh mr wilcox how can you
p00258_B,00258,B,curious mounds but in with you now another time
p00259_B,00259,B,i heard of it one winter in london

p00262_B,00262,B,do please stop i want to go back please
p00263_B,00263,B,i expect a little of will be more to the point than one of us
p00264_B,00264,B,i want to go back though i say the men can t see to it oh this is ridiculous charles i ask you to stop
p00265_B,00265,B,there it s only a rotten cat
p00266_B,00266,B,i m just going to see don t you wait mr fussell
p00267_B,00267,B,wouldn t you have been rude
p00268_B,00268,B,oh henry i have been so naughty we ran over a cat charles told me not to jump out but i would and look your poor meg went such a flop
p00269_B,00269,B,thinking it was a dog
p00270_B,00270,B,ah a dog s a companion a dog ll remember you
p00271_B,00271,B,have you hurt yourself margaret
p00272_B,00272,B,not to speak about and it s my left hand
p00273_B,00273,B,now charles what s happened
p00274_B,00274,B,it is all very well the pater s saying that he will be just to all but one can t be just indefinitely money isn t elastic what s to happen if evie has a family and come to that so may the pater there ll not be enough to go round for there s none coming in either through dolly or percy it s damnable
p00275_B,00275,B,we shall never get through it i think it did go off well since i had to jump out of the motor i m thankful i lighted on my left hand i am so very glad about it henry dear i only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable you must all remember that we have no practical person among us except my aunt and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale
p00276_B,00276,B,i know under the circumstances it would be better to put everything into the hands of harrods or whiteley s or even to go to some hotel you desire a hotel yes because well i mustn t interfere with you no doubt you want to be married from your old home
p00277_B,00277,B,what is it oh what s wrong is tibby ill
p00278_B,00278,B,you have fainted perhaps the air will do you good
p00279_B,00279,B,i m sure i don t want to intrude but you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the porphyrion that i wondered why i wondered whether
p00280_B,00280,B,i don t understand you left the porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern didn t you
p00281_B,00281,B,that s right
p00282_B,00282,B,i told you all that and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month and now he s penniless and i consider that we and our informant are directly to blame
p00283_B,00283,B,i hate all this
p00284_B,00284,B,i hope you do mr bast but it s no good mincing matters you have done yourself no good by coming here if you intend to confront mr wilcox and to call him to account for a chance remark you will make a very great mistake
p00285_B,00285,B,i brought them i did it all
p00286_B,00286,B,that isn t what i want miss schlegel you re very kind and no doubt it s a false position but you make me miserable i seem no good at all
p00287_B,00287,B,it s work he wants can t you see
p00288_B,00288,B,we would like to find you work we want to i like my sister you re only down in your luck go to the hotel have a good night s rest and some day you shall pay me back the bill if you prefer it
p00289_B,00289,B,helen i like mr bast i agree that he s worth helping i agree that we are directly responsible

p00342_B,00342,B,is it the keys that mr wilcox wants
p00343_B,00343,B,it will be more appropriate in the road i am afraid did you get my message
p00344_B,00344,B,what was that
p00345_B,00345,B,it is only that people are far more different than is pretended all over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop here and there they have the matter out and it comforts them don t fret yourself helen develop what you have love your child i do not love children i am thankful to have none i can play with their beauty and charm but that is all nothing real not one scrap of what there ought to be and others others go farther still and move outside humanity altogether a place as well as a person may catch the glow don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end it is part of the battle against sameness differences eternal differences planted by god in a single family so that there may always be colour sorrow perhaps but colour in the daily grey then i can t have you worrying about leonard don t drag in the personal when it will not come forget him
p00346_B,00346,B,yes i did
p00347_B,00347,B,it s apparently got to suit us
p00348_B,00348,B,of course father
p00349_B,00349,B,perfectly splendidly i thought charles wanted it for the boys but last time i saw him he said no because we cannot possibly live in this part of england again charles says we ought to change our name but i cannot think what to for wilcox just suits charles and me and i can t think of any other name
p00350_B,00350,B,down in the field oh come i think we might have had the whole establishment piccaninnies included
p00351_B,00351,B,don t paul you promised you d take care
p00352_B,00352,B,good bye old girl don t you worry about me
p00353_B,00353,B,good bye mr wilcox it does seem curious that mrs wilcox should have left margaret howards end and yet she get it after all
p00354_B,00354,B,good bye
p00355_B,00355,B,so long father
p00356_B,00356,B,good bye
p00357_B,00357,B,could you tell me henry what was that about mrs wilcox having left me howards end
p00358_B,00358,B,yes she did but that is a very old story when she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return and not being herself at the time scribbled howards end on a piece of paper i went into it thoroughly and as it was clearly fanciful i set it aside little knowing what my margaret would be to me in the future i didn t do wrong did i
