Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,14,519,come what may i must have money and get it somehow i will otherwise i shall be ruined nothing except that two pieces of news have reached us from st petersburg in the first place my grandmother is very ill and unlikely to last another couple of days we had this from timothy petrovitch himself and he is a reliable person every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end,the question is how to raise the fifty thousand francs we cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor listen what of mr astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,16,122,of course all of us and every minute of the day for a year and a half now we have been looking for this,then i will go however mad be your fancy only look here shall you not be doing the general a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself it is not about myself i am worrying it is about you and the general why for a mere fancy should i go and insult a woman,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,18,41,yes looking for it i am not her blood relation you know i am merely the general s step daughter yet i am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will,may i ask you who is this mlle blanche,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,20,528,yes for she is fond of me but how come you to think so,why not why not polina,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,22,90,and why are you yourself so interested in them,yet i dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,24,88,it may be so,to tell the truth i do not know i only know that i must win that it is the one resource i have left yes why do i feel so assured on the point,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,26,534,yes that is true as soon as ever he learnt that i was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses i thought you ought to know that,polina you say that again again,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,28,112,you know he has not but where on earth did you pick up this englishman,the frenchman,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,30,72,yes he is in love with me,have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the general,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,32,82,oh no there is no doubt about it he does possess some ch teau or other last night the general told me that for certain now are you satisfied,because you promised to explain matters to me listen i am certain that as soon as ever i begin to play for myself and i still have 120 g lden left i shall win you can then take of me what you require you must not be angry with me for making such a proposal i am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me a gift from me could not possibly offend you moreover it was i who lost your g lden,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,34,98,and why,when have i thought to do so,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,36,96,yes but then the frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two,a maxim straight from the copybook suppose i cannot comport myself with dignity by that i mean that though i am a man of self respect i am unable to carry off a situation properly do you know the reason it is because we russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression it is all a question of mode most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour and genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists it belongs only to the french though a few other europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons that is why with us the mode is so all important the frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown but a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum that is why our good ladies are so fond of frenchmen the frenchman s manners they say are perfect but in my opinion there is no such thing as a frenchman s manners the frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois at the same time as i am not a woman i do not properly understand the question cocks may be excellent birds if i am wrong you must stop me you ought to stop and correct me more often when i am speaking to you for i am too apt to say everything that is in my head you see i have lost my manners i agree that i have none nor yet any dignity i will tell you why i set no store upon such things everything in me has undergone a cheek you know the reason i have not a single human thought in my head for a long while i have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in russia i have been to dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what dresden is like you know the cause of my obsession i have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore i tell you outright that wherever i go i see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference why or how i have come to love you i do not know it may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon do you know i am ignorant even as to what your face is like in all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,38,37,yes absolutely it amuses me to see you grow angry however inasmuch as i allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege,is that so,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,40,15,last time you told me when on the shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss some day i may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word yes you may depend upon it that i shall do so i hate you because i have allowed you to go to such lengths and i also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me for the time being i want you so i must keep you,all of you are on the tiptoe of expectation,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,42,25,you know who she is just mlle blanche nothing further has transpired probably she will soon be madame general that is to say if the rumours that grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true mlle blanche with her mother and her cousin the marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined,is it likely that the marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her la baboulenka what loving friendly behaviour to be sure,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,44,35,that has nothing to do with it listen to me take these 700 florins and go and play roulette with them win as much for me as you can for i am badly in need of money,because though the frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,47,379,why not,something startled me just now and i looked round and saw you some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,49,31,then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties,and he is ten times richer than the frenchman in fact what does the frenchman possess to me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,71,39,because he is a brute,i consider that i have a perfect right to put these questions to you for the reason that i am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,73,517,yes and i suppose you want to know why you are aware are you not that the general is mortgaged to the marquis with all his property consequently if the general s mother does not die the frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge,well bid me do so and i will go to him by the first train tomorrow,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,75,515,yes they are true what then,why should you yet to think that you should have loved de griers the villain the villain but i will kill him in a duel where is he now,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,77,78,yes something i believe will happen to him,and what a fine thing it all is could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony and as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead what do you think of it polina alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,79,17,yes it is very horrible consequently i am the more surprised that you should be so cheerful what are you so pleased about about the fact that you have gone and lost my money,looking for it,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,81,27,why do you ask me these questions,then he has only just begun his courting why i thought he had been doing so a long while,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,83,116,my affairs cannot possibly interest you still if you do wish to know i am in debt i borrowed some money and must pay it back again i have a curious senseless idea that i am bound to win at the gaming tables why i think so i cannot tell but i do think so and with some assurance perhaps it is because of that assurance that i now find myself without any other resource,well then i will kill whomsoever you wish but are you really going to bid me do such deeds,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,85,120,what do not you also hope something from it did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here and did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so were you joking you cannot have been for i remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting,then you throw me out a challenge you think that i will not do it,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,87,509,and why are you so certain,it is de griers handwriting all this is clear enough surely you did not expect aught else from him,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,89,29,perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so,i knew you would ask about him he is very shy and susceptible also he is in love with you,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,91,530,i do not care whether you are so or not well since you ask me i do doubt your ability to take anything seriously you are capable of worrying but not deeply you are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that but why do you want money not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious,but i am offering it to you as a friend in the same way i would offer you my very life,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,93,94,what do you mean by asking all these questions you are very clever today surely you are not drunk,you know that you and i stand on no ceremony and that sometimes i put to you very plain questions i repeat that i am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,95,84,you talk like a child it is always possible to comport oneself with dignity if one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one,or perhaps it is because it is so necessary for you to win it is like a drowning man catching at a straw you yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,97,45,and because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money,do i or do i not love her,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,99,532,you are losing the thread of the argument if you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect,oh polina how can you speak so am i de griers,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,101,106,no i am not but i order you nevertheless to be silent what rubbish,splendid i know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me i can see through you of no use did you say why to give pleasure is always of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury man is a despot by nature and loves to torture you in particular love to do so,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,103,76,what stupid rubbish,why it will be a case of farewell mlle blanche for in such an event she would never become madame general do you know i believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over at his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,105,536,why should i have wanted you to leap from the shlangenberg that would have been of no use to me,yes they have always been yours,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,107,21,oh no why so i believe you surely you are not a coward,that marquis of yours is he also familiar with your family secrets,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,111,23,whomsoever i wish,never mind if i am not mistaken the general has succeeded in borrowing money of the marquis,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major

Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,119,108,because you have sworn that you would leap from the shlangenberg for my sake and that you would kill any one whom i might bid you kill well instead of such murders and tragedies i wish only for a good laugh go without answering me and let me see the baron give you a sound thrashing with his stick,i do not know perhaps i am but i do not know i have long given up thinking about such things,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major

Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,123,521,ah then i can see that you are only a trifler your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon do i not know that what i have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the general will be angry about it but i want to have a good laugh all the same i want that and nothing else why should you insult a woman indeed well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing,polina give me but an hour wait here just one hour until i return yes you must do so do you not see what i mean just stay here for that time,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,378,86,hush not so loud,true i always felt certain that i should win indeed what you say makes me ask myself why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind yet i am still positive that so soon as ever i begin to play for myself i shall infallibly win,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,380,538,take this letter and hand it personally to mr astley go as quickly as ever you can please no answer will be required he himself,mlle left me but ten minutes ago what can have become of her,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,506,513,what is the matter what is the matter,just as i expected well what is the general going to do what about the grandmother,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,508,33,if i am here i have come with all that i have to bring such has always been my way as you shall presently see please light a candle read it,nevertheless in your place i should marry the englishman,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,510,511,i expected nothing at all from him long ago i made up my mind on the subject for i could read his thoughts and knew what he was thinking he thought that possibly i should sue him that one day i might become a nuisance so of set purpose i redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him and waited to see what he would do if a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from st petersburg i should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts and then dismissed him for a long time i have hated him even in earlier days he was not a man and now oh how gladly i could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in,but the document returning the fifty thousand rouble mortgage has the general got it if so possess yourself of it and send it to de griers,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,512,100,no no the general has not got it,not at all i have told you that i find it difficult to explain myself you are hard upon me do not be angry at my chattering you know why you ought not to be angry with me that i am simply an imbecile however i do not mind if you are angry sitting in my room i need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once i fall almost to biting my hands why should you be angry with me because i call myself your slave revel i pray you in my slavery revel in it do you know that sometimes i could kill you not because i do not love you or am jealous of you but because i feel as though i could simply devour you you are laughing,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,514,102,what makes you speak of her i cannot go and live with her nor will i go down upon my knees to any one,i do not care also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together often i have a feeling that i should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you are you certain that it will never come to that you are driving me to frenzy am i afraid of a scandal or of your anger why should i fear your anger i love without hope and know that hereafter i shall love you a thousand times more if ever i should kill you i should have to kill myself too but i shall put off doing so as long as possible for i wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me do you know a very strange thing it is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility why should i not become a fatalist remember how on the third day that we ascended the shlangenberg i was moved to whisper in your ear had you said it i should have leapt do you not believe me,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,516,80,in frankfort where he will be staying for the next three days,what the money that you gave me to lose i told you i should never win for other people least of all for you i obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result i warned you that no good would ever come of it you seem much depressed at having lost your money why do you need it so greatly,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,518,124,if you were to do that he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs what then would be the use of having a quarrel with him you talk sheer nonsense,madame la baronne j ai l honneur d tre votre esclave,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,520,74,what you yourself wish me to leave you for him,then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged i have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,527,50,i am not going to take your money,yes possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace i am not unwilling so to do but in all probability i should lose,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,529,114,because i am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing,do you rather tell me what is going on here why do you seem half afraid of me i can see for myself what is wrong you are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a blanche and there is this frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you yet you actually ask me such a question if you do not tell me how things stand i shall have to put in my oar and do something are you ashamed to be frank with me are you shy of me,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,531,104,you are giving too much for me the beloved of de griers is not worth fifty thousand francs,i care not whether it be wise or stupid i only know that in your presence i must speak speak speak therefore i am speaking i lose all conceit when i am with you and everything ceases to matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,533,92,you why i hate you yes yes i hate you i love you no more than i do de griers buy me would you would you would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as de griers did you love me do you you who were willing even to quarrel with the baron at my bidding no no you are my dear one you are the man i trust you love me you love me will you always love me yes yes he is there open the window and see if he is not shall we go away tomorrow how would it be if we were to try and overtake grandmamma i think we should do so at berlin and what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up and her eyes first lit upon us what too about mr astley he would not leap from the shlangenberg for my sake no of that i am very sure do you know where he is going next year he says he intends to go to the north pole for scientific investigations and has invited me to go with him ha ha ha he also says that we russians know nothing can do nothing without european help but he is a good fellow all the same for instance he does not blame the general in the matter but declares that mlle blanche that love but no i do not know i do not know what poor creatures these people are how sorry i am for them and for grandmamma but when are you going to kill de griers surely you do not intend actually to murder him you fool do you suppose that i should allow you to fight de griers nor shall you kill the baron how absurd you looked when you were talking to the burmergelms i was watching you all the time watching you from where i was sitting and how unwilling you were to go when i sent you oh how i laughed and laughed well are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs,by the way you say you want to pay off a debt it must be a large one is it to the frenchman,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,535,19,you have changed your mind then ha ha ha you are sorry you ever promised them the francs are mine then are they they are mine,yes i believe that you will come in for a good deal,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,537,507,then take your fifty thousand francs,why the fact that you are here,Alexis Ivanovitch,F,major,M,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,15,130,all of you are on the tiptoe of expectation,have you then you can take the consequences,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,17,123,looking for it,ah then i can see that you are only a trifler your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon do i not know that what i have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the general will be angry about it but i want to have a good laugh all the same i want that and nothing else why should you insult a woman indeed well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,19,42,yes i believe that you will come in for a good deal,you know who she is just mlle blanche nothing further has transpired probably she will soon be madame general that is to say if the rumours that grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true mlle blanche with her mother and her cousin the marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,21,527,that marquis of yours is he also familiar with your family secrets,i am not going to take your money,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,23,93,never mind if i am not mistaken the general has succeeded in borrowing money of the marquis,what do you mean by asking all these questions you are very clever today surely you are not drunk,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,25,91,is it likely that the marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her la baboulenka what loving friendly behaviour to be sure,i do not care whether you are so or not well since you ask me i do doubt your ability to take anything seriously you are capable of worrying but not deeply you are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that but why do you want money not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,27,533,then he has only just begun his courting why i thought he had been doing so a long while,you why i hate you yes yes i hate you i love you no more than i do de griers buy me would you would you would you buy me for fifty thousand francs as de griers did you love me do you you who were willing even to quarrel with the baron at my bidding no no you are my dear one you are the man i trust you love me you love me will you always love me yes yes he is there open the window and see if he is not shall we go away tomorrow how would it be if we were to try and overtake grandmamma i think we should do so at berlin and what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up and her eyes first lit upon us what too about mr astley he would not leap from the shlangenberg for my sake no of that i am very sure do you know where he is going next year he says he intends to go to the north pole for scientific investigations and has invited me to go with him ha ha ha he also says that we russians know nothing can do nothing without european help but he is a good fellow all the same for instance he does not blame the general in the matter but declares that mlle blanche that love but no i do not know i do not know what poor creatures these people are how sorry i am for them and for grandmamma but when are you going to kill de griers surely you do not intend actually to murder him you fool do you suppose that i should allow you to fight de griers nor shall you kill the baron how absurd you looked when you were talking to the burmergelms i was watching you all the time watching you from where i was sitting and how unwilling you were to go when i sent you oh how i laughed and laughed well are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,29,121,i knew you would ask about him he is very shy and susceptible also he is in love with you,yes i do challenge you go for such is my will,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,31,75,and he is ten times richer than the frenchman in fact what does the frenchman possess to me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all,yes they are true what then,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,33,85,nevertheless in your place i should marry the englishman,what do not you also hope something from it did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here and did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so were you joking you cannot have been for i remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,35,99,because though the frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair,you are losing the thread of the argument if you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,37,97,is that so,and because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,39,38,i consider that i have a perfect right to put these questions to you for the reason that i am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me,yes absolutely it amuses me to see you grow angry however inasmuch as i allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,41,16,may i ask you who is this mlle blanche,of course all of us and every minute of the day for a year and a half now we have been looking for this,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,43,26,and is the general at last in love,yes that is true as soon as ever he learnt that i was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses i thought you ought to know that,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,48,36,because i wish to play for myself that is my sole reason,yes but then the frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,50,518,yes possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace i am not unwilling so to do but in all probability i should lose,if you were to do that he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs what then would be the use of having a quarrel with him you talk sheer nonsense,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,72,32,have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the general,oh no there is no doubt about it he does possess some ch teau or other last night the general told me that for certain now are you satisfied,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,74,40,then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged i have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true,last time you told me when on the shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss some day i may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word yes you may depend upon it that i shall do so i hate you because i have allowed you to go to such lengths and i also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me for the time being i want you so i must keep you,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,76,516,why it will be a case of farewell mlle blanche for in such an event she would never become madame general do you know i believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over at his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love,in frankfort where he will be staying for the next three days,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,78,529,and what a fine thing it all is could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony and as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead what do you think of it polina alexandrovna,because i am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,80,81,what the money that you gave me to lose i told you i should never win for other people least of all for you i obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result i warned you that no good would ever come of it you seem much depressed at having lost your money why do you need it so greatly,why do you ask me these questions,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,82,18,because you promised to explain matters to me listen i am certain that as soon as ever i begin to play for myself and i still have 120 g lden left i shall win you can then take of me what you require you must not be angry with me for making such a proposal i am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me a gift from me could not possibly offend you moreover it was i who lost your g lden,yes looking for it i am not her blood relation you know i am merely the general s step daughter yet i am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,84,28,or perhaps it is because it is so necessary for you to win it is like a drowning man catching at a straw you yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree,you know he has not but where on earth did you pick up this englishman,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,86,101,true i always felt certain that i should win indeed what you say makes me ask myself why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind yet i am still positive that so soon as ever i begin to play for myself i shall infallibly win,no i am not but i order you nevertheless to be silent what rubbish,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,88,109,to tell the truth i do not know i only know that i must win that it is the one resource i have left yes why do i feel so assured on the point,if i said to you kill that man would you kill him,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,90,537,yet i dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter,then take your fifty thousand francs,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,92,30,by the way you say you want to pay off a debt it must be a large one is it to the frenchman,yes he is in love with me,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,94,115,you know that you and i stand on no ceremony and that sometimes i put to you very plain questions i repeat that i am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended,i am not going to talk to you on that subject i have asked you a question and am waiting for an answer,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,96,87,a maxim straight from the copybook suppose i cannot comport myself with dignity by that i mean that though i am a man of self respect i am unable to carry off a situation properly do you know the reason it is because we russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression it is all a question of mode most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour and genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists it belongs only to the french though a few other europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons that is why with us the mode is so all important the frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown but a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum that is why our good ladies are so fond of frenchmen the frenchman s manners they say are perfect but in my opinion there is no such thing as a frenchman s manners the frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois at the same time as i am not a woman i do not properly understand the question cocks may be excellent birds if i am wrong you must stop me you ought to stop and correct me more often when i am speaking to you for i am too apt to say everything that is in my head you see i have lost my manners i agree that i have none nor yet any dignity i will tell you why i set no store upon such things everything in me has undergone a cheek you know the reason i have not a single human thought in my head for a long while i have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in russia i have been to dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what dresden is like you know the cause of my obsession i have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore i tell you outright that wherever i go i see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference why or how i have come to love you i do not know it may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon do you know i am ignorant even as to what your face is like in all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble,and why are you so certain,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,98,49,when have i thought to do so,then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,100,514,not at all i have told you that i find it difficult to explain myself you are hard upon me do not be angry at my chattering you know why you ought not to be angry with me that i am simply an imbecile however i do not mind if you are angry sitting in my room i need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once i fall almost to biting my hands why should you be angry with me because i call myself your slave revel i pray you in my slavery revel in it do you know that sometimes i could kill you not because i do not love you or am jealous of you but because i feel as though i could simply devour you you are laughing,what makes you speak of her i cannot go and live with her nor will i go down upon my knees to any one,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,102,531,i do not care also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together often i have a feeling that i should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you are you certain that it will never come to that you are driving me to frenzy am i afraid of a scandal or of your anger why should i fear your anger i love without hope and know that hereafter i shall love you a thousand times more if ever i should kill you i should have to kill myself too but i shall put off doing so as long as possible for i wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me do you know a very strange thing it is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility why should i not become a fatalist remember how on the third day that we ascended the shlangenberg i was moved to whisper in your ear had you said it i should have leapt do you not believe me,you are giving too much for me the beloved of de griers is not worth fifty thousand francs,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,104,79,i care not whether it be wise or stupid i only know that in your presence i must speak speak speak therefore i am speaking i lose all conceit when i am with you and everything ceases to matter,yes it is very horrible consequently i am the more surprised that you should be so cheerful what are you so pleased about about the fact that you have gone and lost my money,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,106,535,splendid i know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me i can see through you of no use did you say why to give pleasure is always of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury man is a despot by nature and loves to torture you in particular love to do so,you have changed your mind then ha ha ha you are sorry you ever promised them the francs are mine then are they they are mine,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,108,22,i do not know perhaps i am but i do not know i have long given up thinking about such things,and why are you yourself so interested in them,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,112,24,the frenchman,it may be so,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,114,51,do you rather tell me what is going on here why do you seem half afraid of me i can see for myself what is wrong you are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a blanche and there is this frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you yet you actually ask me such a question if you do not tell me how things stand i shall have to put in my oar and do something are you ashamed to be frank with me are you shy of me,well absurd though it be i place great hopes on your playing of roulette wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal shares wherefore of course you will do as i wish,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,116,380,well then i will kill whomsoever you wish but are you really going to bid me do such deeds,take this letter and hand it personally to mr astley go as quickly as ever you can please no answer will be required he himself,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,120,113,then you throw me out a challenge you think that i will not do it,do not ask me questions return me answers i repeat whomsoever i wish i desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,122,44,then i will go however mad be your fancy only look here shall you not be doing the general a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself it is not about myself i am worrying it is about you and the general why for a mere fancy should i go and insult a woman,that has nothing to do with it listen to me take these 700 florins and go and play roulette with them win as much for me as you can for i am badly in need of money,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,129,520,i have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy,what you yourself wish me to leave you for him,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,377,89,polina alexandrovna,perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,379,508,something startled me just now and i looked round and saw you some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form,if i am here i have come with all that i have to bring such has always been my way as you shall presently see please light a candle read it,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,507,512,why the fact that you are here,no no the general has not got it,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,509,34,it is de griers handwriting all this is clear enough surely you did not expect aught else from him,and why,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,511,103,but the document returning the fifty thousand rouble mortgage has the general got it if so possess yourself of it and send it to de griers,what stupid rubbish,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,513,105,just as i expected well what is the general going to do what about the grandmother,why should i have wanted you to leap from the shlangenberg that would have been of no use to me,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,515,83,why should you yet to think that you should have loved de griers the villain the villain but i will kill him in a duel where is he now,my affairs cannot possibly interest you still if you do wish to know i am in debt i borrowed some money and must pay it back again i have a curious senseless idea that i am bound to win at the gaming tables why i think so i cannot tell but i do think so and with some assurance perhaps it is because of that assurance that i now find myself without any other resource,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,517,378,well bid me do so and i will go to him by the first train tomorrow,hush not so loud,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,519,77,the question is how to raise the fifty thousand francs we cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor listen what of mr astley,yes something i believe will happen to him,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,526,73,i have won two hundred thousand francs shall i put the money there until tomorrow polina here are twenty five thousand florins fifty thousand francs or more take them and tomorrow throw them in de griers face or if you should prefer let me take them to him myself tomorrow yes early tomorrow morning shall i,yes and i suppose you want to know why you are aware are you not that the general is mortgaged to the marquis with all his property consequently if the general s mother does not die the frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,528,117,why not why not polina,why should you think that i am going to let you off i shall bid you do it or else renounce me could you ever do the latter no you know that you couldn t you would first kill whom i had bidden you and then kill me for having dared to send you away do you see that fat baroness it is the baroness burmergelm she arrived three days ago just look at her husband that tall wizened prussian there with the stick in his hand do you remember how he stared at us the other day well go to the baroness take off your hat to her and say something in french,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,530,107,but i am offering it to you as a friend in the same way i would offer you my very life,oh no why so i believe you surely you are not a coward,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,532,95,oh polina how can you speak so am i de griers,you talk like a child it is always possible to comport oneself with dignity if one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,534,20,polina you say that again again,yes for she is fond of me but how come you to think so,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Polina Alexandrovna,536,510,yes they have always been yours,i expected nothing at all from him long ago i made up my mind on the subject for i could read his thoughts and knew what he was thinking he thought that possibly i should sue him that one day i might become a nuisance so of set purpose i redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him and waited to see what he would do if a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from st petersburg i should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts and then dismissed him for a long time i have hated him even in earlier days he was not a man and now oh how gladly i could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face and spit in it and then rub the spittle in,Polina Alexandrovna,M,major,F,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,52,615,that mlle blanche well i have seen a good many women like her it is so does mlle polina like flowers,damn the gambling yes i should certainly have given it up were it not that,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,54,613,what you cannot say,which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than i am,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,56,193,hm then i have an idea in my mind,yet he possesses a good circle of friends,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,172,635,i was just coming to see you and you appear to be out on a similar errand so you have parted with your employers,then see here on the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an apollo belvedere but the two characters do not mix with one another i again am not even a sugar refiner i am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey of this fact mlle polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,174,543,by no means not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment indeed i have never heard any one speak of it,then you are minded to keep her there,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,176,541,because i have had occasion to do so whither are you bound i like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit,and she is in your rooms,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,178,641,that i never doubted,no mr astley after all that has been said i,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,180,611,and concerning this marquis and mlle polina you know nothing beyond surmise,what a strange thing for i know no russians at all here so it cannot have been a russian who befriended me in russia we orthodox folk do go bail for one another but in this case i thought it must have been done by some english stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,182,203,then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them,yes yes that is so for me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if i remain i should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property yes yes that is quite true and yet and yet oh i can well understand why they are all so interested in the general s mother,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,184,213,i feel the same about it as for mlle polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances for my own part i think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially and as for mlle polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as mlle polina are to say the least of it unbecoming but she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter,but why should she be calling me hear her calling again see she is beckoning to us,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,186,549,your eyes look very fiery and in them i can read suspicion now you have no right whatever to be suspicious it is not a right which i can for a moment recognise and i absolutely refuse to answer your questions,indeed then i wish you joy mr astley apropos you have reminded me of something were you beneath my window last night every moment mlle polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there after which she always smiled,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,188,547,yes i think i do know more about it than you do the affair centres around this mlle blanche of that i feel certain,then you know all about it,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,190,189,well my belief is that at the present moment mlle blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the baron and the baroness it might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal,and what of mlle blanche,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,192,53,also i may tell you that mlle blanche has been in roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago i myself was in the place at the time and in those days mlle blanche was not known as mlle de cominges nor was her mother the widow de cominges even in existence in any case no one ever mentioned the latter de griers too had not materialised and i am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance likewise the marquisate de griers is of recent creation of that i have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance even the name de griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that i have a friend who once met the said marquis under a different name altogether,i really cannot say,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,194,177,possibly mlle blanche also may possess that yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the baroness an invitation to leave the town and she left it,what a splendid fellow you are mr astley and since i have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the casino caf where we can sit and smoke and have a talk i do not intend to go away i intend on the contrary to remain here,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,196,187,well i must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name barberini or something of the kind the fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage at first mlle blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse i distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum but worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous upon this mlle zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as madame barberini was in despair she shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy in the hotel there was staying also a polish count you must know that all travelling poles are counts and the spectacle of mlle zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression so the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled indeed that evening the couple entered the casino arm in arm mlle zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown for instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside doubtless you have noticed them,enough you need say no more very well very well then i stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer but you are a good fellow and i am glad to know what you think about it all even though i do not need your advice for instance what reason should you assign for the general taking fright in this way why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident even de griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications yes he de griers has actually been playing the suppliant to me and mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand mlle polina s note when i would ask was that note written mlle polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it at all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon yet what is her personal concern in the matter why is she interested in it at all why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious baron and what sort of a business do you call it for the general to be going to marry mlle blanche de cominges he told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present what is your opinion of it all your look convinces me that you know more about it than i do,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,198,631,well they are not worth noticing to the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart however mlle zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal suddenly the count too disappeared even as the prince had done and that same evening mlle zelma was forced to appear in the casino alone on this occasion no one offered her a greeting two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the baron burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval to his distaste however mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red later that evening a complaint from the baroness led the authorities to request mlle not to re enter the casino if you feel in any way surprised that i should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that i had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove mlle zelma in his carriage from roulettenberg to spa now mark you mlle wants to become madame general in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from casino authorities as she received three years ago at present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players yes that is a much more paying game i even suspect that the unfortunate general is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also de griers or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the baron and the baroness drawn to herself in short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental you form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the general or with mlle polina now do you understand,then i beg your pardon a thousand times mr astley i meant nothing offensive to mlle polina for i have nothing of which to accuse her moreover the question of there being anything between this frenchman and this russian lady is not one which you and i need discuss nor even attempt to understand,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,200,183,it would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing against what was i to warn you as likely as not the general knows more about mlle blanche even than i do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and mlle polina only yesterday i saw this frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with de griers while the general was careering in their wake on a roan horse he had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough as he passed i looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever however it is no affair of mine for i have only recently had the happiness to make mlle polina s acquaintance also i have already told you that i do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you,quite so quite so i admit that yet that is not the question what do you make of it when i met you i was just coming to ask you your opinion for myself i could have killed this frenchman and am not sure that i shall not do so even yet,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,202,191,you forget in the first place that this mlle de cominges is the general s inamorata and in the second place that mlle polina the general s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the general s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well,oh oh,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,204,629,in whom,what in spite of our old friendship,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,206,637,ah then of course their interests centre around her it is a question of succession let that but be settled and the general will marry mlle polina will be set free and de griers,i agree but therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less true but i am only wasting words,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,208,209,will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for,what you think that he is waiting for that,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,210,55,i know of nothing else,no i have never noticed whether she does so or not,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,212,179,yes i did hear a woman s voice calling but whose i do not know the someone was calling you in russian ah now i can see whence the cries come they come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys behind her see that pile of luggage she must have arrived by train,no i fear not,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,492,551,indeed she arrived at the casino even before i had taken my departure by train so i knew she had been playing if i should have time i will go to the casino to night and take a look at her the thing interests me,she ought to see a doctor you know mr astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,494,561,to frankfort,good bye but i am not going to paris likewise pardon me what is to become of this family i mean that the affair of the general and mlle polina will soon be all over the town,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,540,645,she is ill,perhaps i shall need it for a meal,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,542,181,yes she is in my rooms,no i know nothing for certain about them no nothing,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,544,607,yes i am minded to keep her there,how closely you watch the doings of your old friends that does you infinite credit but stop a moment you have reminded me of something was it you who bailed me out of roulettenberg prison when i was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden someone did so,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,546,493,yes i have it was i who told you about it had she not been ill she would not have gone and spent the night with you,where have you been today,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,548,197,yes for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine unfortunately being ill she made a mistake and went to your rooms instead,yes certainly,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,550,627,indeed no i was not there but i was waiting in the corridor and walking about the hotel,and de griers is he too travelling in switzerland,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,552,639,yes she ought i have sent for one and if she dies i shall hold you responsible,indeed is that really so,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,554,207,never mind tell me if it is true that last night you won two hundred thousand thalers,yes and de griers,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,558,643,because all russians who have grown rich go to paris,yes i will take it if at the same time you will embrace me,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,560,173,indeed i am sure that you do not moreover if you were to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in paris well good bye now i feel sure that today will see you gone from here,how do you know that is every one aware of the fact,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,562,175,i daresay yet i hardly suppose that that will break the general s heart moreover mlle polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses in short we may say that as a family this family has ceased to exist,then how come you to know it,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,606,199,you here well i had an idea that i should meet you do not trouble to tell me anything for i know all yes all in fact your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge,no i do not tell me mr astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this mlle blanche is you never warned either myself or the general nor most of all mlle polina how could you do it,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,608,619,oh dear no though i knew all the time that you were lying there,enough mr astley kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for i can remember things for myself only for a time have i put them out of my head only until i shall have rehabilitated myself am i keeping my memory dulled when that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,610,563,no i am afraid i could not,i suppose he means to shoot me in a duel should polina die yes that is what he intends to do,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,612,195,well i am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy,but why,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,614,633,your remarks please me as they always did in those words i see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days only russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded all thinking persons know that ancient truth yet on the present occasion i assure you i am sincerely glad to see that you are not cast down tell me are you never going to give up gambling,ah i see you are interested mr astley but it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface at the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance a frenchman mr astley is merely a fine figure of a man with this you as a britisher may not agree with it i also as a russian may not agree out of envy yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion for instance one may look upon racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and i too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule yet about him mr astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it yes the frenchman the parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we russians had even ceased to be bears the revolution bequeathed to the french nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance yes taken by himself the frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young russian lady de griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure mr astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him and even though it may offend you i feel bound to say that the majority also of english people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same but to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies at all events they need more experience for instance this mlle polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and i cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to monsieur de griers she may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer de griers this will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that de griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old general and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind only give her the de griers of former days and she will ask of you no more the more she may detest the present de griers the more will she lament the de griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination you are a sugar refiner mr astley are you not,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,616,495,that you are losing i thought so you need not tell me any more i know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully have you no other employment than gambling,on business,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,618,621,you are growing blas you have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom i know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory though i can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life i feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth,say no more and to show you that i have not wholly forgotten the past may i enquire where mlle polina is if it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she yet never have i heard a word concerning her,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,620,625,then you will have to be here another ten years should i then be alive i will remind you here on this very bench of what i have just said in fact i will bet you a wager that i shall do so,indeed on what subject then have i a better right to speak to you than on this with it are bound up all your recollections and mine however do not be alarmed i have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs my interest in mlle polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings about them you could tell me in two words,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,622,185,no i do not think it was she at the present moment she is in switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her,do you know what i believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from mlle polina herself,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,624,553,mlle polina is the best of all possible living beings but i repeat that i shall thank you to cease questioning me about her you never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling,pardon me but what do you mean,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,626,555,well on condition that the matter shall end there i will tell you that for a long time mlle polina was ill and still is so my mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of england and thereafter mlle polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left mlle polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling that was about six months ago and now mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the grandmother s will and are now being educated in london as for the general he died in paris last month of a stroke mlle blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the grandmother that i think concludes all that i have to tell,no i won a hundred thousand florins,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,628,211,no nor do i know where he is also i warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me,but i do i do he is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards mlle polina a dowry as soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the frenchman s neck all women are like that even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned what polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love that is my opinion look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought all this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed polina could perpetrate any mad act she she but who called me by name who is shouting for me i heard some one calling in russian it was a woman s voice listen,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,630,617,yes in spite of our old friendship,no none whatever,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,632,205,if you do not care to hear their names coupled together may i ask you what you mean by the expressions and there being anything between them why do you call them so particularly a frenchman and a russian lady,in the old woman of moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,634,201,yes i belong to the well known firm of lovell and co,enough to me it is as clear as day that mlle polina knows all about this mlle blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with mlle blanche you may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the baron yes it is there that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow yet she herself it was who launched me at the baron the devil take it but i was left no choice in the matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,636,609,you are saying this because you are feeling bitter yet there is not the least originality in your words,perhaps you could tell me who did bail me out,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,638,559,yes you are for you are only talking nonsense are you aware that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at her request i came to homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too,but what could i do in paris in summer time i love her mr astley surely you know that,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,640,545,yes poor unfortunate she did love you and i may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost even if i were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised you might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you yet you remained here and your life is now over i am not blaming you for this in my view all russians resemble you or are inclined to do so if it is not roulette then it is something else the exceptions are very rare nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours for roulette is not exclusively a russian game hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you i tremble to think now good bye you are in want of money i suppose then take these ten louis d or more i shall not give you for you would only gamble it away take care of these coins and farewell once more take care of them,but mr astley that will raise a scandal it ought not to be allowed besides she is very ill perhaps you had not remarked that,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,642,57,take care of them i am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore i give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another also if i could be certain that you would leave both homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country i would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but i give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other take the money therefore and good bye,at all events she in her turn has promised to give me an explanation to night and to reveal to me something or another,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Mr. Astley,Alexis Ivanovitch,644,623,with pleasure,which means that she has dealt you a serious wound,Alexis Ivanovitch,M,intermediate,M,major
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,53,634,i really cannot say,yes i belong to the well known firm of lovell and co,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,55,616,no i have never noticed whether she does so or not,that you are losing i thought so you need not tell me any more i know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully have you no other employment than gambling,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,173,192,how do you know that is every one aware of the fact,also i may tell you that mlle blanche has been in roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago i myself was in the place at the time and in those days mlle blanche was not known as mlle de cominges nor was her mother the widow de cominges even in existence in any case no one ever mentioned the latter de griers too had not materialised and i am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance likewise the marquisate de griers is of recent creation of that i have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance even the name de griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that i have a friend who once met the said marquis under a different name altogether,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,175,544,then how come you to know it,yes i am minded to keep her there,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,177,542,what a splendid fellow you are mr astley and since i have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the casino caf where we can sit and smoke and have a talk i do not intend to go away i intend on the contrary to remain here,yes she is in my rooms,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,179,492,no i fear not,indeed she arrived at the casino even before i had taken my departure by train so i knew she had been playing if i should have time i will go to the casino to night and take a look at her the thing interests me,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,181,636,no i know nothing for certain about them no nothing,you are saying this because you are feeling bitter yet there is not the least originality in your words,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,183,638,quite so quite so i admit that yet that is not the question what do you make of it when i met you i was just coming to ask you your opinion for myself i could have killed this frenchman and am not sure that i shall not do so even yet,yes you are for you are only talking nonsense are you aware that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at her request i came to homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,185,196,do you know what i believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from mlle polina herself,well i must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name barberini or something of the kind the fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage at first mlle blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse i distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum but worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous upon this mlle zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as madame barberini was in despair she shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy in the hotel there was staying also a polish count you must know that all travelling poles are counts and the spectacle of mlle zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression so the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled indeed that evening the couple entered the casino arm in arm mlle zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown for instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside doubtless you have noticed them,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,187,212,enough you need say no more very well very well then i stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer but you are a good fellow and i am glad to know what you think about it all even though i do not need your advice for instance what reason should you assign for the general taking fright in this way why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident even de griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications yes he de griers has actually been playing the suppliant to me and mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand mlle polina s note when i would ask was that note written mlle polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it at all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon yet what is her personal concern in the matter why is she interested in it at all why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious baron and what sort of a business do you call it for the general to be going to marry mlle blanche de cominges he told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present what is your opinion of it all your look convinces me that you know more about it than i do,yes i did hear a woman s voice calling but whose i do not know the someone was calling you in russian ah now i can see whence the cries come they come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys behind her see that pile of luggage she must have arrived by train,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,189,206,and what of mlle blanche,ah then of course their interests centre around her it is a question of succession let that but be settled and the general will marry mlle polina will be set free and de griers,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,191,54,oh oh,what you cannot say,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,193,180,yet he possesses a good circle of friends,and concerning this marquis and mlle polina you know nothing beyond surmise,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,195,190,but why,well my belief is that at the present moment mlle blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the baron and the baroness it might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,197,628,yes certainly,no nor do i know where he is also i warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,199,186,no i do not tell me mr astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this mlle blanche is you never warned either myself or the general nor most of all mlle polina how could you do it,your eyes look very fiery and in them i can read suspicion now you have no right whatever to be suspicious it is not a right which i can for a moment recognise and i absolutely refuse to answer your questions,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,201,194,enough to me it is as clear as day that mlle polina knows all about this mlle blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with mlle blanche you may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the baron yes it is there that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow yet she herself it was who launched me at the baron the devil take it but i was left no choice in the matter,possibly mlle blanche also may possess that yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the baroness an invitation to leave the town and she left it,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,203,614,yes yes that is so for me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if i remain i should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property yes yes that is quite true and yet and yet oh i can well understand why they are all so interested in the general s mother,your remarks please me as they always did in those words i see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days only russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded all thinking persons know that ancient truth yet on the present occasion i assure you i am sincerely glad to see that you are not cast down tell me are you never going to give up gambling,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,205,548,in the old woman of moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death,yes for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine unfortunately being ill she made a mistake and went to your rooms instead,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,207,56,yes and de griers,hm then i have an idea in my mind,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,209,182,what you think that he is waiting for that,then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,211,640,but i do i do he is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards mlle polina a dowry as soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the frenchman s neck all women are like that even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned what polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love that is my opinion look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought all this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed polina could perpetrate any mad act she she but who called me by name who is shouting for me i heard some one calling in russian it was a woman s voice listen,yes poor unfortunate she did love you and i may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost even if i were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised you might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you yet you remained here and your life is now over i am not blaming you for this in my view all russians resemble you or are inclined to do so if it is not roulette then it is something else the exceptions are very rare nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours for roulette is not exclusively a russian game hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you i tremble to think now good bye you are in want of money i suppose then take these ten louis d or more i shall not give you for you would only gamble it away take care of these coins and farewell once more take care of them,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,213,644,but why should she be calling me hear her calling again see she is beckoning to us,with pleasure,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,491,622,she is gambling away everything that she has,no i do not think it was she at the present moment she is in switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,493,550,where have you been today,indeed no i was not there but i was waiting in the corridor and walking about the hotel,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,495,562,on business,i daresay yet i hardly suppose that that will break the general s heart moreover mlle polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses in short we may say that as a family this family has ceased to exist,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,541,494,and she is in your rooms,to frankfort,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,543,200,then you are minded to keep her there,it would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing against what was i to warn you as likely as not the general knows more about mlle blanche even than i do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and mlle polina only yesterday i saw this frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with de griers while the general was careering in their wake on a roan horse he had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough as he passed i looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever however it is no affair of mine for i have only recently had the happiness to make mlle polina s acquaintance also i have already told you that i do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,545,552,but mr astley that will raise a scandal it ought not to be allowed besides she is very ill perhaps you had not remarked that,yes she ought i have sent for one and if she dies i shall hold you responsible,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,547,610,then you know all about it,no i am afraid i could not,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,549,184,indeed then i wish you joy mr astley apropos you have reminded me of something were you beneath my window last night every moment mlle polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there after which she always smiled,i feel the same about it as for mlle polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances for my own part i think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially and as for mlle polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as mlle polina are to say the least of it unbecoming but she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,551,210,she ought to see a doctor you know mr astley,i know of nothing else,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,553,642,pardon me but what do you mean,take care of them i am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore i give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another also if i could be certain that you would leave both homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country i would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but i give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other take the money therefore and good bye,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,555,176,no i won a hundred thousand florins,because i have had occasion to do so whither are you bound i like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,559,178,but what could i do in paris in summer time i love her mr astley surely you know that,that i never doubted,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,561,202,good bye but i am not going to paris likewise pardon me what is to become of this family i mean that the affair of the general and mlle polina will soon be all over the town,you forget in the first place that this mlle de cominges is the general s inamorata and in the second place that mlle polina the general s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the general s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,607,618,how closely you watch the doings of your old friends that does you infinite credit but stop a moment you have reminded me of something was it you who bailed me out of roulettenberg prison when i was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden someone did so,you are growing blas you have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom i know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory though i can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life i feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,609,608,perhaps you could tell me who did bail me out,oh dear no though i knew all the time that you were lying there,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,611,198,what a strange thing for i know no russians at all here so it cannot have been a russian who befriended me in russia we orthodox folk do go bail for one another but in this case i thought it must have been done by some english stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country,well they are not worth noticing to the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart however mlle zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal suddenly the count too disappeared even as the prince had done and that same evening mlle zelma was forced to appear in the casino alone on this occasion no one offered her a greeting two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the baron burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval to his distaste however mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red later that evening a complaint from the baroness led the authorities to request mlle not to re enter the casino if you feel in any way surprised that i should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that i had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove mlle zelma in his carriage from roulettenberg to spa now mark you mlle wants to become madame general in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from casino authorities as she received three years ago at present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players yes that is a much more paying game i even suspect that the unfortunate general is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also de griers or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the baron and the baroness drawn to herself in short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental you form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the general or with mlle polina now do you understand,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,613,632,which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than i am,if you do not care to hear their names coupled together may i ask you what you mean by the expressions and there being anything between them why do you call them so particularly a frenchman and a russian lady,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,615,496,damn the gambling yes i should certainly have given it up were it not that,on business,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,617,630,no none whatever,yes in spite of our old friendship,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,619,624,enough mr astley kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for i can remember things for myself only for a time have i put them out of my head only until i shall have rehabilitated myself am i keeping my memory dulled when that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead,mlle polina is the best of all possible living beings but i repeat that i shall thank you to cease questioning me about her you never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,621,188,say no more and to show you that i have not wholly forgotten the past may i enquire where mlle polina is if it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she yet never have i heard a word concerning her,yes i think i do know more about it than you do the affair centres around this mlle blanche of that i feel certain,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,623,554,which means that she has dealt you a serious wound,never mind tell me if it is true that last night you won two hundred thousand thalers,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,625,556,indeed on what subject then have i a better right to speak to you than on this with it are bound up all your recollections and mine however do not be alarmed i have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs my interest in mlle polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings about them you could tell me in two words,good heavens then i suppose you will be off to paris this morning,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,627,214,and de griers is he too travelling in switzerland,yes so she is,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,629,620,what in spite of our old friendship,then you will have to be here another ten years should i then be alive i will remind you here on this very bench of what i have just said in fact i will bet you a wager that i shall do so,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,631,208,then i beg your pardon a thousand times mr astley i meant nothing offensive to mlle polina for i have nothing of which to accuse her moreover the question of there being anything between this frenchman and this russian lady is not one which you and i need discuss nor even attempt to understand,will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,633,204,ah i see you are interested mr astley but it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface at the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance a frenchman mr astley is merely a fine figure of a man with this you as a britisher may not agree with it i also as a russian may not agree out of envy yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion for instance one may look upon racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and i too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule yet about him mr astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it yes the frenchman the parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we russians had even ceased to be bears the revolution bequeathed to the french nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance yes taken by himself the frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young russian lady de griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure mr astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him and even though it may offend you i feel bound to say that the majority also of english people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same but to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies at all events they need more experience for instance this mlle polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and i cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to monsieur de griers she may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer de griers this will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that de griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old general and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind only give her the de griers of former days and she will ask of you no more the more she may detest the present de griers the more will she lament the de griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination you are a sugar refiner mr astley are you not,in whom,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,635,612,then see here on the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an apollo belvedere but the two characters do not mix with one another i again am not even a sugar refiner i am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey of this fact mlle polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal,well i am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,637,560,i agree but therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less true but i am only wasting words,indeed i am sure that you do not moreover if you were to stay here you would lose everything that you possess and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in paris well good bye now i feel sure that today will see you gone from here,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,639,546,indeed is that really so,yes i have it was i who told you about it had she not been ill she would not have gone and spent the night with you,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,641,174,no mr astley after all that has been said i,by no means not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment indeed i have never heard any one speak of it,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Alexis Ivanovitch,Mr. Astley,643,626,yes i will take it if at the same time you will embrace me,well on condition that the matter shall end there i will tell you that for a long time mlle polina was ill and still is so my mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of england and thereafter mlle polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left mlle polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling that was about six months ago and now mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the grandmother s will and are now being educated in london as for the general he died in paris last month of a stroke mlle blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the grandmother that i think concludes all that i have to tell,Mr. Astley,M,major,M,intermediate
Marqis De Griers,The General,62,63,to a certain extent that is true,oh no it is not true and you you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country,Alexis Ivanovitch; Polina Alexandrovna; The General,M,intermediate,M,intermediate

Blanche; The General,M,intermediate,M,intermediate
Marqis De Griers,The General,393,394,well at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services but if later,alexis ivanovitch pray pardon me for having said what i did just now for having said more than i meant to do i beg and beseech you i kiss the hem of your garment as our russian saying has it for you and only you can save us i and mlle de cominges we all of us beg of you but you understand do you not surely you understand,Alexis Ivanovitch; Mlle.
