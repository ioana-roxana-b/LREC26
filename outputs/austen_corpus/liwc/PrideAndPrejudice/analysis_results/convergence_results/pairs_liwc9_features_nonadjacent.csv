00018,A Young Lucas,Charlotte Lucas,84,86,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,minor,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00019,Mrs. Bennet,Elizabeth,85,87,then you would drink a great deal more than you ought and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly,but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too,A Young Lucas; Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00093,Elizabeth,Mr. Bingley,255,257,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
