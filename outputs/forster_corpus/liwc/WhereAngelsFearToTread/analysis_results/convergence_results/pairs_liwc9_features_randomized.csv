00355,Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,729,866,you sound despondent don t forget that you return victorious,the time i thought you weak and heedless and went instead of you to get the baby that began it as far as i know the beginning or it may have begun when you took us to the theatre and i saw him mixed up with music and light but didn t understand till the morning then you opened the door and i knew why i had been so happy afterwards in the church i prayed for us all not for anything new but that we might just be as we were he with the child he loved you and i and harriet safe out of the place and that i might never see him or speak to him again i could have pulled through then the thing was only coming near like a wreath of smoke it hadn t wrapped me round,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00356,Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,803,378,he will have to marry her i heard from him this morning just as we left milan he finds he has gone too far to back out it would be expensive i don t know how much he minds not as much as we suppose i think at all events there s not a word of blame in the letter i don t believe he even feels angry i never was so completely forgiven ever since you stopped him killing me it has been a vision of perfect friendship he nursed me he lied for me at the inquest and at the funeral though he was crying you would have thought it was my son who had died certainly i was the only person he had to be kind to he was so distressed not to make harriet s acquaintance and that he scarcely saw anything of you in his letter he says so again,that he is a thoroughly wicked man,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0
00357,Mr. Herriton,Caroline Abbott,805,719,indeed i will,perhaps i am extreme i ve been trying to run you just like your mother i feel you ought to fight it out with harriet every little trifle for some reason does seem incalculably important today and when you say of a thing that nothing hangs on it it sounds like blasphemy there s never any knowing how am i to put it which of our actions which of our idlenesses won t have things hanging on it for ever,Caroline Abbott,M,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
