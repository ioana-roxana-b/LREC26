Mrs. Norris,Fanny Price,664,665,upon my word fanny you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence you ought to be very much obliged to mrs grant for thinking of you and to your aunt for letting you go and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary for i hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way or ever dining out at all and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated nor must you be fancying that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to you the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me mrs grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you or else it would never have come into her head and you may be very certain that if your cousin julia had been at home you would not have been asked at all oh depend upon it your aunt can do very well without you or you would not be allowed to go i shall be here so you may be quite easy about your aunt and i hope you will have a very agreeable day and find it all mighty delightful but i must observe that five is the very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table and i cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as mrs grant should not contrive better and round their enormous great wide table too which fills up the room so dreadfully had the doctor been contented to take my dining table when i came away as anybody in their senses would have done instead of having that absurd new one of his own which is wider literally wider than the dinner table here how infinitely better it would have been and how much more he would have been respected for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere remember that fanny five only five to be sitting round that table however you will have dinner enough on it for ten i dare say the nonsense and folly of people s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves makes me think it right to give you a hint fanny now that you are going into company without any of us and i do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins as if you were dear mrs rushworth or julia that will never do believe me remember wherever you are you must be the lowest and last and though miss crawford is in a manner at home at the parsonage you are not to be taking place of her and as to coming away at night you are to stay just as long as edmund chuses leave him to settle that,yes ma am i should not think of anything else,Fanny Price,F,intermediate,F,major

Fanny Price,Henry Crawford,904,905,no indeed you know your duty too well for me to even supposing,a sermon well delivered is more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to compose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of the pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers on subjects limited and long worn threadbare in all common hands who can say anything new or striking anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to the educated to those who were capable of estimating my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy,Edmund; Henry Crawford; Lady Bertram,F,major,M,major

Edmund,Fanny Price,926,927,you are mistaken fanny the dissimilarity is not so strong you are quite enough alike you have tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in common you have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions you forget yourself there is a decided difference in your tempers i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheerfulness will counteract this he sees difficulties nowhere and his pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike fanny does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your happiness together do not imagine it i am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination for much or little company in the propensity to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i exclude extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the likeliest way to produce an extreme a counteraction gentle and continual is the best safeguard of manners and conduct,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Edmund,927,928,it is not merely in temper that i consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in that respect i think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which i object to still more i must say cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him behaving as it appeared to me so very improperly and unfeelingly i may speak of it now because it is all over so improperly by poor mr rushworth not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which in short at the time of the play i received an impression which will never be got over,my dear fanny let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong crawford was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest were blameless i was playing the fool with my eyes open,Edmund,F,major,M,major

Fanny Price,Edmund,929,930,as a bystander perhaps i saw more than you did and i do think that mr rushworth was sometimes very jealous,very possibly no wonder nothing could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest,Edmund,F,major,M,major

Fanny Price,Edmund,931,932,before the play i am much mistaken if julia did not think he was paying her attentions,julia i have heard before from some one of his being in love with julia but i could never see anything of it and fanny though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by crawford and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encouragement a man like crawford lively and it may be a little unthinking might be led on to there could be nothing very striking because it is clear that he had no pretensions his heart was reserved for you and i must say that its being for you has raised him inconceivably in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shews his proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him unspoilt by his uncle it proves him in short everything that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not,Edmund,F,major,M,major

Fanny Price,Edmund,933,934,i am persuaded that he does not think as he ought on serious subjects,say rather that he has not thought at all upon serious subjects which i believe to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the disadvantages indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are crawford s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed with rare felicity he will make you happy fanny i know he will make you happy but you will make him everything,Edmund,F,major,M,major

Edmund,Fanny Price,936,937,as usual believing yourself unequal to anything fancying everything too much for you well though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sincerely anxious that you may i have no common interest in crawford s well doing next to your happiness fanny his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in crawford i was very much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing everything in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as it deserved and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly maxims which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you fanny just as she ought she desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it i should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity,was mrs grant in the room then,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major

Edmund,Fanny Price,940,941,yes she laments it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you fanny you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to everything he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and esteems you with all her heart,i knew she would be very angry with me,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Edmund,941,942,i knew she would be very angry with me,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality,Edmund,F,major,M,major
Edmund,Fanny Price,942,943,my dearest fanny do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment i wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you should be henry s wife and i observed that she always spoke of you as fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Edmund,943,944,and mrs grant did she say did she speak was she there all the time,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me,Edmund,F,major,M,major
Edmund,Fanny Price,944,945,yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal fanny seems to have been unbounded that you could refuse such a man as henry crawford seems more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is teasing you i have done do not turn away from me,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Edmund,945,946,i should have thought that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the perfections in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allowing mr crawford to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr crawford i am sure his sisters rating him as they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to have thought of him and and we think very differently of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this seems to imply,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life,Edmund,F,major,M,major
Edmund,Fanny Price,946,947,my dear dear fanny now i have the truth i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought i could understand you you have now given exactly the explanation which i ventured to make for you to your friend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of crawford s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their disfavour that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss crawford made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to persevere in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at lessingby till that very day i had almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at lessingby might have been felt all my life,you were near staying there,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Edmund,947,948,you were near staying there,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough,Edmund,F,major,M,major
Edmund,Fanny Price,948,949,very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from mansfield to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should certainly have staid but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away long enough,you spent your time pleasantly there,Fanny Price,M,major,F,major

Fanny Price,Edmund,951,952,the miss owens you liked them did not you,yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt fanny for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two distinct orders of being you and miss crawford have made me too nice,Edmund,F,major,M,major
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,953,954,i must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere sad sad girl i do not know when i shall have done scolding you ha am i here again the east room once only was i in this room before once only before do you remember it i came to rehearse your cousin came too and we had a rehearsal you were our audience and prompter a delightful rehearsal i shall never forget it here we were just in this part of the room here was your cousin here was i here were the chairs oh why will such things ever pass away the scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable the subject of it so very very what shall i say he was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me i think i see him now trying to be as demure and composed as anhalt ought through the two long speeches when two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state matrimony may be called a happy life i suppose no time can ever wear out the impression i have of his looks and voice as he said those words it was curious very curious that we should have such a scene to play if i had the power of recalling any one week of my existence it should be that week that acting week say what you would fanny it should be that for i never knew such exquisite happiness in any other his sturdy spirit to bend as it did oh it was sweet beyond expression but alas that very evening destroyed it all that very evening brought your most unwelcome uncle poor sir thomas who was glad to see you yet fanny do not imagine i would now speak disrespectfully of sir thomas though i certainly did hate him for many a week no i do him justice now he is just what the head of such a family should be nay in sober sadness i believe i now love you all i have had a little fit since i came into this room as you may perceive but it is over now so let us sit down and be comfortable for as to scolding you fanny which i came fully intending to do i have not the heart for it when it comes to the point good gentle fanny when i think of this being the last time of seeing you for i do not know how long i feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you i hate to leave you i shall see no one half so amiable where i am going who says we shall not be sisters i know we shall i feel that we are born to be connected and those tears convince me that you feel it too dear fanny,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,954,955,but you are only going from one set of friends to another you are going to a very particular friend,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my excellent sister yourself and the bertrams in general you have all so much more heart among you than one finds in the world at large you all give me a feeling of being able to trust and confide in you which in common intercourse one knows nothing of i wish i had settled with mrs fraser not to go to her till after easter a much better time for the visit but now i cannot put her off and when i have done with her i must go to her sister lady stornaway because she was rather my most particular friend of the two but i have not cared much for her these three years how perfectly i remember my resolving to look for you upstairs and setting off to find my way to the east room without having an idea whereabouts it was how well i remember what i was thinking of as i came along and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table at work and then your cousin s astonishment when he opened the door at seeing me here to be sure your uncle s returning that very evening there never was anything quite like it why fanny you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport you for a short time into our circle in town that you might understand how your power over henry is thought of there oh the envyings and heartburnings of dozens and dozens the wonder the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how he is courted and how i am courted for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs fraser in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in northamptonshire again for there is a daughter of mr fraser by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be occasioning of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for janet at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five and twenty to be as steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very ill bred in their house i shall call to mind the conjugal manners of mansfield parsonage with respect even dr grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment which makes one feel there is attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the frasers i shall be at mansfield for ever fanny my own sister as a wife sir thomas bertram as a husband are my standards of perfection poor janet has been sadly taken in and yet there was nothing improper on her side she did not run into the match inconsiderately there was no want of foresight she took three days to consider of his proposals and during those three days asked the advice of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear aunt whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr fraser this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend flora who jilted a very nice young man in the blues for the sake of that horrid lord stornaway who has about as much sense fanny as mr rushworth but much worse looking and with a blackguard character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the bye flora ross was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible fanny who can think of him with anything like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not excellent creature i will not tease you everything shall take its course but dear fanny you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some surmises as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the necklace oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire i remember it perfectly,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,955,956,yes very true mrs fraser has been my intimate friend for years but i have not the least inclination to go near her i can think only of the friends i am leaving my

Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,956,957,do you mean then that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand oh miss crawford that was not fair,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,957,958,knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for both your sakes,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,958,959,i will not say that i was not half afraid at the time of its being so for there was something in your look that frightened me but not at first i was as unsuspicious of it at first indeed indeed i was it is as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace as to your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a particularity i had been sensible of it some little time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss crawford been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not blind i could not but see that mr crawford amused himself in gallantries which did mean nothing,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major
Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,959,960,ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad flirt and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in young ladies affections i have often scolded him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any affections worth caring for and then fanny the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph,i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander by can judge of,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major

Mary Crawford,Fanny Price,961,962,i do not defend him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at everingham i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never been addicted to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any woman before that he loves you with all his heart and will love you as nearly for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman for ever i think henry will do as much for you i cannot imagine henry ever to have been happier than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission,oh yes how very very kind of him,Fanny Price,F,major,F,major
Fanny Price,Mary Crawford,962,963,oh yes how very very kind of him,i know he must have exerted himself very much for i know the parties he had to move the admiral hates trouble and scorns asking favours and there are so many young men s claims to be attended to in the same way that a friendship and energy not very determined is easily put by what a happy creature william must be i wish we could see him i should like to sit talking with you here all day but we must not forget the ladies below and so good bye my dear my amiable my excellent fanny for though we shall nominally part in the breakfast parlour i must take leave of you here and i do take leave longing for a happy reunion and trusting that when we meet again it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve i shall see your cousin in town soon he talks of being there tolerably soon and sir thomas i dare say in the course of the spring and your eldest cousin and the rushworths and julia i am sure of meeting again and again and all but you i have two favours to ask fanny one is your correspondence you must write to me and the other that you will often call on mrs grant and make her amends for my being gone,Mary Crawford,F,major,F,major

Fanny Price,Edmund,1018,1019,how long were you together,five and twenty minutes well she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them she spoke of it fanny with a steadier voice than i can said she i shall soon have done i have told you the substance of all that she said as soon as i could speak i replied that i had not supposed it possible coming in such a state of mind into that house as i had done that anything could occur to make me suffer more but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence that though i had in the course of our acquaintance been often sensible of some difference in our opinions on points too of some moment it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it that the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister with whom lay the greater seduction i pretended not to say but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself giving it every reproach but the right considering its ill consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong and last of all and above all recommending to us a compliance a compromise an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin on the chance of a marriage which thinking as i now thought of her brother should rather be prevented than sought all this together most grievously convinced me that i had never understood her before and that as far as related to mind it had been the creature of my own imagination not miss crawford that i had been too apt to dwell on for many months past that perhaps it was best for me i had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship feelings hopes which must at any rate have been torn from me now and yet that i must and would confess that could i have restored her to what she had appeared to me before i would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem this is what i said the purport of it but as you may imagine not spoken so collectedly or methodically as i have repeated it to you she was astonished exceedingly astonished more than astonished i saw her change countenance she turned extremely red i imagined i saw a mixture of many feelings a great though short struggle half a wish of yielding to truths half a sense of shame but habit habit carried it she would have laughed if she could it was a sort of laugh as she answered,Edmund,F,major,M,major
