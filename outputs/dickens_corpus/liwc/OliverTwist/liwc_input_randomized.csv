p00036_A,00036,A,and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was afterwards increased to twenty pound notwithstanding the most superlative and i may say supernat ral exertions on the part of this parish we have never been able to discover who is his father or what was his mother s settlement name or condition

p00045_A,00045,A,the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury em that is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they don t die upon the road to spite us ha ha ha we are forgetting business ma am here is your porochial stipend for the month

p00087_A,00087,A,three pound ten
p00088_A,00088,A,not a farthing more
p00089_A,00089,A,this is the boy your worship

p00100_A,00100,A,i have no doubt you are my friend my boy you look pale and alarmed what is the matter
p00101_A,00101,A,stand a little away from him beadle now boy tell us what s the matter don t be afraid
p00102_A,00102,A,hold your tongue beadle

p00104_A,00104,A,i beg your worship s pardon did your worship speak to me
p00105_A,00105,A,yes hold your tongue
p00106_A,00106,A,we refuse to sanction these indentures
p00107_A,00107,A,i hope i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child
p00108_A,00108,A,i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr bumble
p00109_A,00109,A,think so the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble
p00110_A,00110,A,well well mr bumble there s no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble well seasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham
p00111_A,00111,A,of course of course and if i don t get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you see he he he
p00112_A,00112,A,though i must say though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over one s calculation makes a great hole in one s profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir
p00113_A,00113,A,gadso that s just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you know dear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble i never noticed it before
p00114_A,00114,A,i recollect the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didn t they and they made it a special verdict i think by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had
p00115_A,00115,A,very true they would indeed
p00116_A,00116,A,so they are
p00117_A,00117,A,no more they have
p00118_A,00118,A,so do i
p00119_A,00119,A,let em alone for that
p00120_A,00120,A,oh why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poor s rates
p00121_A,00121,A,aha is that you bumble
p00122_A,00122,A,aha an order for a coffin eh
p00123_A,00123,A,bayton i never heard the name before
p00124_A,00124,A,proud eh come that s too much
p00125_A,00125,A,so it is
p00126_A,00126,A,ah there s promptness
p00127_A,00127,A,well i ne ver did
p00128_A,00128,A,now bill fill up
p00129_A,00129,A,you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry i say you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry
p00130_A,00130,A,so are the coffins
p00131_A,00131,A,well well every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable
p00132_A,00132,A,just so
p00133_A,00133,A,by the bye you don t know anybody who wants a boy do you a porochial prentis who is at present a dead weight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms
p00134_A,00134,A,yes i think it rather pretty the die is the same as the porochial seal the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on newyear s morning mr sowerberry i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight
p00135_A,00135,A,tush foolery if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk they d have enough to do
p00136_A,00136,A,juries juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches
p00137_A,00137,A,they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that
p00138_A,00138,A,i despise em
p00139_A,00139,A,and i only wish we d a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em
p00140_A,00140,A,well what about the boy
p00141_A,00141,A,hem well
p00142_A,00142,A,no one else mr sowerberry here i ve brought the boy
p00143_A,00143,A,for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards
p00144_A,00144,A,obstinate people mr sowerberry very obstinate proud too i m afraid sir
p00145_A,00145,A,oh it s sickening antimonial mr sowerberry
p00146_A,00146,A,we only heard of the family the night before last and we shouldn t have known anything about them then only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blacking bottle offhand
p00147_A,00147,A,promptness indeed but what s the consequence what s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir why the husband sends back word that the medicine won t suit his wife s complaint and so she shan t take it says she shan t take it sir good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coal heaver only a week before sent em for nothing with a blackin bottle in and he sends back word that she shan t take it sir
p00148_A,00148,A,never did sir no nor nobody never did but now she s dead we ve got to bury her and that s the direction and the sooner it s done the better
p00149_A,00149,A,come my good fellow they want to shut up the yard
p00150_A,00150,A,oh that s the boy is it mrs sowerberry will you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear my dear this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of
p00151_A,00151,A,here charlotte give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip he hasn t come home since the morning so he may go without em i dare say the boy isn t too dainty to eat em are you boy
p00152_A,00152,A,nothing my dear nothing
p00153_A,00153,A,not at all my dear i thought you didn t want to hear my dear i was only going to say
p00154_A,00154,A,but my dear i want to ask your advice
p00155_A,00155,A,it s only about young twist my dear a very good looking boy that my dear
p00156_A,00156,A,dear me he s very small
p00157_A,00157,A,oh you know mr bumble he must be mad no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you
p00158_A,00158,A,dear dear this comes of being liberal
p00159_A,00159,A,why he is rather small he is small there s no denying it but he ll grow mrs sowerberry he ll grow
p00160_A,00160,A,meat ma am meat you ve over fed him ma am you ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him ma am unbecoming a person of his condition as the board mrs sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you what have paupers to do with soul or spirit it s quite enough that we let em have live bodies if you had kept the boy on gruel ma am this would never have happened
p00161_A,00161,A,ah i dare say he will on our victuals and our drink i see no saving in parish children not i for they always cost more to keep than they re worth however men always think they know best there get downstairs little bag o bones

p01102_A,01102,A,sikes is not i suppose

p01107_A,01107,A,certain i expected him here before now if you ll wait ten minutes he ll be
p01108_A,01108,A,good nothing more
p01109_A,01109,A,i say what a time this would be for a sell i ve got phil barker here so drunk that a boy might take him
p01110_A,01110,A,and no news of barney
p01111_A,01111,A,will he be here to night
p01112_A,01112,A,hush yes
p01113_A,01113,A,no no tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me to night no say to morrow as he is not here to morrow will be time enough
p01114_A,01114,A,not a word now
p01115_A,01115,A,ah is that
p01116_A,01116,A,on your business my dear on your business all night
p01117_A,01117,A,nothing good
p01118_A,01118,A,shut the door
p01119_A,01119,A,we can say the few words we ve got to say in here my dear and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours we ll set the candle on the stairs there
p01120_A,01120,A,only hear him
p01121_A,01121,A,but not mine he might have become of use to me when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my good friend
p01122_A,01122,A,i saw it was not easy to train him to the business he was not like other boys in the same circumstances
p01123_A,01123,A,i had no hold upon him to make him worse his hand was not in i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all
p01124_A,01124,A,no no my dear and i don t quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him
p01125_A,01125,A,why we can t afford to do that just now my dear and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden she ll care no more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if he is alive i can make him one from this time and if if it s not likely mind but if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead
p01126_A,01126,A,what where
p01127_A,01127,A,it s your fancy
p01128_A,01128,A,hush my dear it is he sure enough come away
p01129_A,01129,A,and and good
p01130_A,01130,A,yes i have been lingering here these two hours where the devil have you been
p01131_A,01131,A,oh of course well and what s come of it
p01132_A,01132,A,nothing bad i hope it s as dark as the grave make haste
p01133_A,01133,A,that wasn t my doing the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole
p01134_A,01134,A,i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once
p01135_A,01135,A,why do you mean to say you couldn t have done it if you had chosen haven t you done it with other boys scores of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldn t you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life
p01136_A,01136,A,what then
p01137_A,01137,A,curse him no or he would have been a thief long ago
p01138_A,01138,A,that was not my doing
p01139_A,01139,A,throttle the girl
p01140_A,01140,A,it s no fault of mine if he is mind that fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death i told you from the first i won t shed blood it s always found out and haunts a man besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me fire this infernal den what s that
p01141_A,01141,A,yonder the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath
p01142_A,01142,A,i ll swear i saw it it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away
p01143_A,01143,A,not that infernal hole we were in before
p01144_A,01144,A,ho ho there pincher neptune come here come here
p01145_A,01145,A,i ll tell you what it is gentlemen we re all afraid

p01152_A,01152,A,a kind of a busting noise
p01153_A,01153,A,of shoes sir seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room i says when i had woke him
p01154_A,01154,A,here he is here s one of the thieves ma am here s a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light
p01155_A,01155,A,wounded desperate miss

p01157_A,01157,A,i shouldn t wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen mr giles ought to know
p01158_A,01158,A,so i do it s natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am
p01159_A,01159,A,certainly and whatever mr giles says it isn t our place to contradict him no no i know my sitiwation thank my stars i know my sitiwation
p01160_A,01160,A,i an t
p01161_A,01161,A,you re a falsehood mr giles
p01162_A,01162,A,so am i only there s no call to tell a man he is so bounceably
p01163_A,01163,A,i shouldn t wonder if it was
p01164_A,01164,A,more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater
p01165_A,01165,A,so you did
p01166_A,01166,A,you re a woman
p01167_A,01167,A,you re a lie brittles
p01168_A,01168,A,speak for yourself sir
p01169_A,01169,A,i heerd it now quite apparent i says i says i tossed off the clothes got softly out of bed drew on a pair of
p01170_A,01170,A,it was about half past two or i wouldn t swear that it mightn t have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes i fancied i heerd a noise heerd a noise i says at first and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct
p01171_A,01171,A,i says
p01172_A,01172,A,what sort of a noise
p01173_A,01173,A,was he frightened
p01174_A,01174,A,not a bit of it he was as firm ah pretty near as firm as i was
p01175_A,01175,A,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p01176_A,01176,A,i m here miss don t be frightened miss i ain t much injured he didn t make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him
p01177_A,01177,A,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p01178_A,01178,A,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p01179_A,01179,A,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p01180_A,01180,A,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p01181_A,01181,A,and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he
p01182_A,01182,A,he is always slow
p01183_A,01183,A,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p01184_A,01184,A,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p01185_A,01185,A,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p01186_A,01186,A,he gets worse instead of better i think
p01187_A,01187,A,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p01188_A,01188,A,rose my dear rose my love what is this in tears my dear child what distresses you
p01189_A,01189,A,not ill my love
p01190_A,01190,A,my child i never saw you so before
p01191_A,01191,A,but not the less my niece not the less my dearest child i would not lose her now for all the treasures of the world my sweet companion my own dear girl
p01192_A,01192,A,i never heard of such a thing my dear mrs maylie bless my soul in the silence of the night too i never heard of such a thing you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright why didn t you send bless me my man should have come in a minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody i m sure under such circumstances dear dear so unexpected in the silence of the night too and you miss rose i
p01193_A,01193,A,vice takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her
p01194_A,01194,A,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p01195_A,01195,A,there is no other no other take my word for it
p01196_A,01196,A,you seem to think that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to day except yourself miss rose i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present
p01197_A,01197,A,well that is no very difficult matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger now i make this stipulation that i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events
p01198_A,01198,A,oh yes aunt is is a bargain
p01199_A,01199,A,upon my word i hardly know what to do
p01200_A,01200,A,i doubt it my dear young lady i don t think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one
p01201_A,01201,A,i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so but i don t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer nevertheless
p01202_A,01202,A,because my pretty cross examiner because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a police officer on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentleman s house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself don t you see all this
p01203_A,01203,A,no of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them the more i think of it the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
p01204_A,01204,A,perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie
p01205_A,01205,A,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p01206_A,01206,A,but at so early an age
p01207_A,01207,A,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p01208_A,01208,A,you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself
p01209_A,01209,A,oh no aunt
p01210_A,01210,A,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p01211_A,01211,A,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p01212_A,01212,A,you believe it surely
p01213_A,01213,A,why not
p01214_A,01214,A,i see it of course but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child
p01215_A,01215,A,ah to be sure so there is that was your handiwork giles i understand honour eh well i don t know perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and you ve fought a duel giles gad that s true where is he show me the way i ll look in again as i come down mrs maylie that s the little window that he got in at eh well i couldn t have believed it this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie
p01216_A,01216,A,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p01217_A,01217,A,now let us hear what you think of him he has not been shaved very recently but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding stop though let me first see that he is in visiting order
p01218_A,01218,A,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p01219_A,01219,A,you must compose yourself be calm my dear ma am pray

p01262_A,01262,A,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p01263_A,01263,A,well master this warn t a put up thing
p01264_A,01264,A,there was two of em in it and they had a boy with em that s plain from the size of the window that s all to be said at present we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please
p01265_A,01265,A,why thank you miss it s dry work this sort of duty anythink that s handy miss don t put yourself out of the way on our accounts
p01266_A,01266,A,of course the lady knows that don t she always interrupting you are partner this here conkey chickweed miss kept a public house over battlebridge way and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting and badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for i ve seen em off en he warn t one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high he was wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they set up a hue and cry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i don t know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house said chickweed says spyers says the poor man spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moment s notice he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars out jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed a tearing down the street full cry away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner shoots round sees a little crowd dives in says chickweed it was a remarkable occurrence but he warn t to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public house next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again at last he couldn t help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed a roaring out off he starts once more with chickweed half way down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterday s one the man s lost again this was done once or twice more till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief
p01267_A,01267,A,jem spyers for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says said chickweed said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadn t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances
p01268_A,01268,A,if you please sir
p01269_A,01269,A,this is the lady of the house
p01270_A,01270,A,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p01271_A,01271,A,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p01272_A,01272,A,and what the devil s a put up thing
p01273_A,01273,A,what shall it be
p01274_A,01274,A,what did jem spyers say
p01275_A,01275,A,very curious indeed now if you please you can walk upstairs
p01276_A,01276,A,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p01277_A,01277,A,wery likely not ma am but they might have been in it for all that
p01278_A,01278,A,we find it was a town hand for the style of work is first rate
p01279_A,01279,A,ah i have seen a good many pieces of business like this in my time ladies
p01280_A,01280,A,that was something in this way warn t it that was done by conkey chickweed that was
p01281_A,01281,A,it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon this here conkey chickweed
p01282_A,01282,A,has this man been a drinking sir
p01283_A,01283,A,certainly not
p01284_A,01284,A,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p01285_A,01285,A,wery easy disposed of if it is
p01286_A,01286,A,more likely on that wery account
p01287_A,01287,A,wery pretty indeed it is
p01288_A,01288,A,that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers
p01289_A,01289,A,you always gave that to him it was the family pet i tell you conkey hadn t any more to do with it than i had

p01307_A,01307,A,you will make me happier than i can tell you to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine do you understand me
p01308_A,01308,A,to whom
p01309_A,01309,A,i am sure they would and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them
p01310_A,01310,A,i would not alarm you if i could avoid it but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt

p01317_A,01317,A,to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care of me before if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure
p01318_A,01318,A,i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth
p01319_A,01319,A,getting out of a coach and going into a house i didn t speak to him i couldn t speak to him for he didn t see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did look here here it is here s where he lives i m going there directly oh dear me dear me what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again

p01372_A,01372,A,i would not for the world sir indeed you may believe me mr losberne s words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come i heard him say so
p01373_A,01373,A,that i missed them in an instant
p01374_A,01374,A,the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him
p01375_A,01375,A,as i am that the men were at the window the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
p01376_A,01376,A,i hope so sir
p01377_A,01377,A,oh certainly sir i shall be proud to do it
p01378_A,01378,A,oh quite sir quite
p01379_A,01379,A,i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise giles i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her you can say i am coming
p01380_A,01380,A,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p01381_A,01381,A,mother why did you not write before
p01382_A,01382,A,but why why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if rose had i cannot utter that word now if this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself how could i ever have know happiness again
p01383_A,01383,A,and who can wonder if it be so mother or why should i say if it is it is you know it mother you must know it
p01384_A,01384,A,this is unkind mother do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
p01385_A,01385,A,mother he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus
p01386_A,01386,A,and ever will the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little
p01387_A,01387,A,let it rest with rose then you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way
p01388_A,01388,A,i have considered mother i have considered years and years i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave this place rose shall hear me
p01389_A,01389,A,there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother
p01390_A,01390,A,how then she has formed no other attachment
p01391_A,01391,A,what do you mean
p01392_A,01392,A,i shall see you again to night
p01393_A,01393,A,you will tell her i am here
p01394_A,01394,A,and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her you will not refuse to do this mother
p01395_A,01395,A,i did but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losberne s opinion
p01396_A,01396,A,if that had been the case harry i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import
p01397_A,01397,A,i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty
p01398_A,01398,A,i think my dear son that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting above all i think that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so
p01399_A,01399,A,you think so now harry
p01400_A,01400,A,harry it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now
p01401_A,01401,A,i will not but i would have you consider
p01402_A,01402,A,she shall
p01403_A,01403,A,not coldly far from it
p01404_A,01404,A,no indeed you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already what i would say is this before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on rose s history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic
p01405_A,01405,A,that i leave you to discover i must go back to her god bless you
p01406_A,01406,A,by and by when i leave rose
p01407_A,01407,A,of course
p01408_A,01408,A,who was the other
p01409_A,01409,A,this is strange
p01410_A,01410,A,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p01411_A,01411,A,the great nobs under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them
p01412_A,01412,A,drive on hard fast full gallop nothing short of flying will keep pace with me to day
p01413_A,01413,A,strange blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it
p01414_A,01414,A,and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning eh why you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together
p01415_A,01415,A,that s a fine fellow you shall come and see me when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone
p01416_A,01416,A,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p01417_A,01417,A,a few a very few will suffice rose what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated i i ought to have left here before
p01418_A,01418,A,i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming a creature a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels fluttered between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved you these were distractions almost too great to bear they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course you recovered day by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind
p01419_A,01419,A,there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours rose my own dear rose for years for years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy s attachment and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer
p01420_A,01420,A,it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose
p01421_A,01421,A,and your reasons rose your reasons for this decision
p01422_A,01422,A,to yourself
p01423_A,01423,A,if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty
p01424_A,01424,A,then you return my love say but that dear rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment
p01425_A,01425,A,have received this declaration very differently do not conceal that from me at least rose
p01426_A,01426,A,another word rose your reason in your own words from your own lips let me hear it
p01427_A,01427,A,one word more rose dearest rose one more if i had been less less fortunate the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if i had been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth
p01428_A,01428,A,if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this one question
p01429_A,01429,A,i ask one promise once and only once more say within a year but it may be much sooner i may speak to you again on this subject for the last time
p01430_A,01430,A,no to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it
p01431_A,01431,A,i know it all dear rose i know it all i am not here by accident nor have i heard all this to night for i knew it yesterday only yesterday do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise
p01432_A,01432,A,all you gave me leave at any time within a year to renew the subject of our last discourse
p01433_A,01433,A,not to press you to alter your determination but to hear you repeat it if you would i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or act to seek to change it
p01434_A,01434,A,the disclosure of to night
p01435_A,01435,A,you harden your heart against me rose
p01436_A,01436,A,then why inflict it on yourself think dear rose think what you have heard to night
p01437_A,01437,A,not yet not yet my hopes my wishes prospects feeling every thought in life except my love for you have undergone a change i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a home a heart and home yes dearest rose and those and those alone are all i have to offer
p01438_A,01438,A,you should indeed forgive me for saying so but i wish you had
p01439_A,01439,A,i did not mean that i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you
p01440_A,01440,A,your behaviour has ever been kind and noble as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer
p01441_A,01441,A,it is that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love look into the world think how many hearts you would be proud to gain are there confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful friend you have
p01442_A,01442,A,you have a right to know them you can say nothing to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it alike to others and to myself
p01443_A,01443,A,yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world
p01444_A,01444,A,they do not
p01445_A,01445,A,if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved i could have
p01446_A,01446,A,i could stay why should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry as we have met to day we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you
p01447_A,01447,A,the prospect before you is a brilliant one all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life are in store for you but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place in a word there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me
p01448_A,01448,A,do not press me to reply the question does not arise and never will it is unfair almost unkind to urge it
p01449_A,01449,A,then if your lot had been differently cast if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger i must leave you now indeed
p01450_A,01450,A,not to press me to alter my right determination it will be useless
p01451_A,01451,A,stay you do know all
p01452_A,01452,A,i did
p01453_A,01453,A,the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should to night it is a struggle but one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear
p01454_A,01454,A,the disclosure of to night leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before
p01455_A,01455,A,oh harry harry i wish i could and spare myself this pain
p01456_A,01456,A,and what have i heard what have i heard that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all there we have said enough harry we have said enough
p01457_A,01457,A,what do you mean
p01458_A,01458,A,were you looking for me when you peered in at the window
p01459_A,01459,A,i see you were not or you have known my name you don t know it i would recommend you not to ask for it
p01460_A,01460,A,and have done none i have seen you before i think you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again you were beadle here once were you not
p01461_A,01461,A,just so it was in that character i saw you what are you now
p01462_A,01462,A,you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i doubt not don t scruple to answer freely man i know you pretty well you see
p01463_A,01463,A,fill this glass again let it be strong and hot you like it so i suppose
p01464_A,01464,A,you understand what that means landlord now listen to me i came down to this place to day to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind i want some information from you i don t ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is put up that to begin with carry your memory back let me see twelve years last winter
p01465_A,01465,A,and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave
p01466_A,01466,A,yes a boy was born there
p01467_A,01467,A,a murrain on the young devils i speak of one a meek looking pale faced boy who was apprenticed down here to a coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed
p01468_A,01468,A,it s not of him i want to hear i ve heard enough of him it s of a woman the hag that nursed his mother where is she
p01469_A,01469,A,what do you mean

p01471_A,01471,A,at nine in the evening at nine in the evening bring her to me there i needn t tell you to be secret it s your interest what do you want following me
p01472_A,01472,A,come in don t keep me here what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet
p01473_A,01473,A,cooling yourselves not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hell s fire out as a man can carry about with him you won t cool yourself so easily don t think it this is the woman is it
p01474_A,01474,A,you may ask but whether i answer or not is another question
p01475_A,01475,A,never nor against me either see here but don t move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush look down don t fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game if you flung a man s body down there where would it be to morrow morning
p01476_A,01476,A,there if the sea ever gives up its dead as books say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party
p01477_A,01477,A,you ll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you i am not afraid of your wife

p01481_A,01481,A,master of the workhouse master of the workhouse young man
p01482_A,01482,A,i suppose a married man is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner
p01483_A,01483,A,not too strong
p01484_A,01484,A,it s a long time very good i ve done it
p01485_A,01485,A,the lying in room i suppose

p01487_A,01487,A,why you mean oliver young twist i remember him of course there wasn t a obstinater young rascal
p01488_A,01488,A,where is she it would be hard to tell there s no midwifery there whichever place she s gone to so i suppose she s out of employment anyway
p01489_A,01489,A,that she died last winter
p01490_A,01490,A,to morrow
p01491_A,01491,A,we we were only cooling ourselves
p01492_A,01492,A,twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides

p01498_A,01498,A,the first question is of what nature was her communication
p01499_A,01499,A,who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is
p01500_A,01500,A,humph there may be money s worth to get eh
p01501_A,01501,A,something that was taken from her something that she wore something that
p01502_A,01502,A,it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds speak out and let me know which
p01503_A,01503,A,five and twenty pounds
p01504_A,01504,A,not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when it s told and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more
p01505_A,01505,A,what if i pay it for nothing
p01506_A,01506,A,he had better have cut it out before he came if he can t speak in a lower tone so he s your husband eh
p01507_A,01507,A,i thought as much when you came in so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that there s only one will between them i m in earnest see here now gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the house top is gone let s hear your story
p01508_A,01508,A,was there no one by no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed no one who could hear and might by possibility understand
p01509_A,01509,A,good go on

p01513_A,01513,A,without saying more it s a lie i ll not be played with she said more i ll tear the life out of you both but i ll know what it was
p01514_A,01514,A,which contained
p01515_A,01515,A,for what
p01516_A,01516,A,where is it now
p01517_A,01517,A,and this is all
p01518_A,01518,A,it is the other question
p01519_A,01519,A,you think women never can keep secrets i suppose
p01520_A,01520,A,and what may that be
p01521_A,01521,A,about the mother of the boy you named yes
p01522_A,01522,A,that s the second the first is what may the communication be worth
p01523_A,01523,A,nobody better than you i am persuaded
p01524_A,01524,A,perhaps there may
p01525_A,01525,A,you had better bid i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to what s it worth to you
p01526_A,01526,A,add five pounds to the sum you have named give me five and twenty pounds in gold and i ll tell you all i know not before
p01527_A,01527,A,i spoke as plainly as i could it s not a large sum either
p01528_A,01528,A,such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last
p01529_A,01529,A,you are a fool and had better hold your tongue
p01530_A,01530,A,he my husband
p01531_A,01531,A,when this woman that we called old sally died she and i were alone
p01532_A,01532,A,not a soul we were alone i stood alone beside the body when death came over it
p01533_A,01533,A,she spoke of a young creature who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying
p01534_A,01534,A,the child was the one you named to him last night the mother this nurse had robbed
p01535_A,01535,A,in death she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infant s sake
p01536_A,01536,A,as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this she fell back and died
p01537_A,01537,A,she didn t utter another word but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper
p01538_A,01538,A,nothing it was a pawnbroker s duplicate
p01539_A,01539,A,in good time i ll tell you i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge
p01540_A,01540,A,there it has the word agnes engraved on the inside there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born i found out that
p01541_A,01541,A,all i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at and i want to know nothing for it s safer not but i may ask you two questions may i

p01569_A,01569,A,it s a hard matter to get to see you lady if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done you d have been sorry for it one day and not without reason either
p01570_A,01570,A,oh lady lady if there was more like you there would be fewer like me there would there would
p01571_A,01571,A,let me stand lady and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late is is that door shut
p01572_A,01572,A,i lady i am the infamous creature you have heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me god do not mind shrinking openly from me lady i am younger than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it the poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement
p01573_A,01573,A,thank heaven upon your knees dear lady that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness and and something worse than all as i have been from my cradle i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed
p01574_A,01574,A,he knows you and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out
p01575_A,01575,A,then he goes by some other amongst us which i more than thought before some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monks the man i asked you about you know
p01576_A,01576,A,that monks had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldn t make out why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
p01577_A,01577,A,he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i did and i saw him no more till last night
p01578_A,01578,A,i ll tell you lady last night he came again again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were these they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now he d rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides
p01579_A,01579,A,the truth lady though it comes from my lips then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldn t he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet he says
p01580_A,01580,A,those were his words and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your two legged spaniel was
p01581_A,01581,A,he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this i must get back quickly
p01582_A,01582,A,i wish to go back i must go back because how can i tell such things to an innocent lady like you because among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i can t leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now
p01583_A,01583,A,lady dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late
p01584_A,01584,A,it is i cannot leave him now i could not be his death
p01585_A,01585,A,nothing could save him if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel
p01586_A,01586,A,i don t know what it is i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last
p01587_A,01587,A,you should lady and i know you will you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done
p01588_A,01588,A,you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do
p01589_A,01589,A,will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed
p01590_A,01590,A,every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve i will walk on london bridge if i am alive
p01591_A,01591,A,when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are give away your hearts love will carry you all lengths even such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us pity us lady pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering
p01592_A,01592,A,not a penny
p01593_A,01593,A,you would serve me best lady if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am to night than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine
p01594_A,01594,A,real ones this was not

p01596_A,01596,A,yes yes you have
p01597_A,01597,A,what look before you lady look at that dark water how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them it may be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last
p01598_A,01598,A,it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors should good night good night
p01599_A,01599,A,no i have not done this for money let me have that to think of and yet give me something that you have worn i should like to have something no no not a ring your gloves or handkerchief anything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet lady there bless you god bless you good night good night
p01600_A,01600,A,i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you do not think of that tell me why you wished to see me i am the person you inquired for

p01602_A,01602,A,yes why

p01604_A,01604,A,i pity you it wrings my heart to hear you
p01605_A,01605,A,i never heard the name
p01606_A,01606,A,yes i understand
p01607_A,01607,A,for what purpose
p01608_A,01608,A,and what occurred then
p01609_A,01609,A,what is all this
p01610_A,01610,A,his brother
p01611_A,01611,A,you do not mean to tell me that this was said in earnest
p01612_A,01612,A,but what can i do to what use can i turn this communication without you back why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay
p01613_A,01613,A,your having interfered in this dear boy s behalf before your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed oh do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the first the first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things
p01614_A,01614,A,it is never too late for penitence and atonement
p01615_A,01615,A,why should you be
p01616_A,01616,A,is it possible that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is madness
p01617_A,01617,A,what am i to do i should not let you depart from me thus
p01618_A,01618,A,of what use then is the communication you have made this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve
p01619_A,01619,A,but where can i find you again when it is necessary i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time
p01620_A,01620,A,i promise you solemnly
p01621_A,01621,A,stay another moment think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touch is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation
p01622_A,01622,A,you will take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet again
p01623_A,01623,A,do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you i wish to serve you indeed
p01624_A,01624,A,speak to her kindly poor creature she seems to need it
p01625_A,01625,A,you have my true and faithful pledge
p01626_A,01626,A,what can be the end of this poor creature s life
p01627_A,01627,A,do not speak thus pray
p01628_A,01628,A,this purse take it for my sake that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble
p01629_A,01629,A,dear me i beg your pardon young lady i imagined it was some importunate person who i beg you will excuse me be seated pray
p01630_A,01630,A,that is my name this is my friend mr grimwig grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes
p01631_A,01631,A,now miss maylie to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken thank god this is great happiness to me great happiness but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie you must pardon my finding fault with you but why not have brought him
p01632_A,01632,A,you put yourself beyond its pale the past has been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies mis spent and such priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never grants again but for the future you may hope i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you before the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day light you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment come i would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you quit them all while there is time and opportunity
p01633_A,01633,A,young lady give me your hand do not tremble you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say
p01634_A,01634,A,mr brownlow i believe sir
p01635_A,01635,A,oliver twist you knew him as
p01636_A,01636,A,he is waiting in a coach at the door
p01637_A,01637,A,she will be persuaded now she hesitates i am sure
p01638_A,01638,A,hark did she call i thought i heard her voice
p01639_A,01639,A,if they have i do not know how they can but if they have any reference to me pray let me hear them at some other time i have not strength or spirits now
p01640_A,01640,A,a bad one i ll eat my head if he is not a bad one
p01641_A,01641,A,he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over
p01642_A,01642,A,then what the devil is to be done are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver
p01643_A,01643,A,gentleness and care i d send them one and all to
p01644_A,01644,A,what object
p01645_A,01645,A,ah i almost forgot that
p01646_A,01646,A,hanging a few of them at least in all probability and transporting the rest
p01647_A,01647,A,then i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really
p01648_A,01648,A,i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine
p01649_A,01649,A,the man will be taken he will be taken to night
p01650_A,01650,A,yes yes his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness spies are hovering about in every direction i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government to night
p01651_A,01651,A,harry as soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them
p01652_A,01652,A,when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time they re sure of him
p01653_A,01653,A,what have you done
p01654_A,01654,A,not exactly that but we must proceed gently and with great care
p01655_A,01655,A,never mind where but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view
p01656_A,01656,A,simply the discovery of oliver s parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived
p01657_A,01657,A,you see placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about
p01658_A,01658,A,thus it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot
p01659_A,01659,A,do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray the promise shall be kept i don t think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself i should like to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves
p01660_A,01660,A,we must put it to the vote who may he be
p01661_A,01661,A,the murderer
p01662_A,01662,A,i will give fifty more and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it where is mr maylie
p01663_A,01663,A,fagin what of him
p01664_A,01664,A,all that i could hope to do and even more coupling the poor girl s intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friend s inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day write and appoint the evening after to morrow at seven for the meeting we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature which way have they taken
p01665_A,01665,A,we stay in town of course while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains
p01666_A,01666,A,is this the three cripples
p01667_A,01667,A,a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country recommended us here we want to sleep here to night
p01668_A,01668,A,show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring will yer

p01673_A,01673,A,we have not so much dust as that in london
p01674_A,01674,A,why one need be sharp in this town my dear and that s the truth
p01675_A,01675,A,dear a man need be always emptying a till or a pocket or a woman s reticule or a house or a mail coach or a bank if he drinks it regularly don t mind me my dear ha ha it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance it was very lucky it was only me
p01676_A,01676,A,no matter who s got it or who did it my dear i m in that way myself and i like you for it
p01677_A,01677,A,in that way of business and so are the people of the house you ve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe here as you could be there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples that is when i like to make it so and i have taken a fancy to you and the young woman so i ve said the word and you may make your minds easy i ll tell you more i have got a friend that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right way where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first and be taught all the others
p01678_A,01678,A,what advantage would it be to me to be anything else here let me have a word with you outside
p01679_A,01679,A,quite perfect you re a genius my dear
p01680_A,01680,A,now what do you think if you was to like my friend could you do better than join him
p01681_A,01681,A,the top of the tree employs a power of hands has the very best society in the profession
p01682_A,01682,A,not a countryman among em and i don t think he d take you even on my recommendation if he didn t run rather short of assistants just now
p01683_A,01683,A,it couldn t possibly be done without
p01684_A,01684,A,not when it s in a note you can t get rid of number and date taken i suppose payment stopped at the bank ah it s not worth much to him it ll have to go abroad and he couldn t sell it for a great deal in the market
p01685_A,01685,A,live like a gentleman board and lodging pipes and spirits free half of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns
p01686_A,01686,A,a little fancy work
p01687_A,01687,A,i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my dear my friend wants somebody who would do that well very much
p01688_A,01688,A,that s true no it might not
p01689_A,01689,A,what do you think of the old ladies there s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running round the corner
p01690_A,01690,A,stop the kinchin lay
p01691_A,01691,A,the kinchins my dear is the young children that s sent on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money away they ve always got it ready in their hands then knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself ha ha ha
p01692_A,01692,A,to be sure it is and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like that where they re always going errands and you can upset as many kinchins as you want any hour in the day ha ha ha
p01693_A,01693,A,will ten do what name shall i tell my good friend
p01694_A,01694,A,mrs bolter s humble servant i hope i shall know her better very shortly
p01695_A,01695,A,oh yes i understand perfectly good night good night
p01696_A,01696,A,every man s his own friend my dear he hasn t as good a one as himself anywhere
p01697_A,01697,A,don t believe that when a man s his own enemy it s only because he s too much his own friend not because he s careful for everybody but himself pooh pooh there ain t such a thing in nature
p01698_A,01698,A,that stands to reason some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven it s neither my friend neither it s number one
p01699_A,01699,A,in a little community like ours my dear we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people
p01700_A,01700,A,you see we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so for instance it s your object to take care of number one meaning yourself
p01701_A,01701,A,well you can t take care of yourself number one without taking care of me number one
p01702_A,01702,A,no i don t i m of the same importance to you as you are to yourself
p01703_A,01703,A,only think only consider you ve done what s a very pretty thing and what i love you for doing but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat that s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose in plain english the halter the gallows the gallows my dear is an ugly finger post which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow s career on the broad highway to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with you
p01704_A,01704,A,only to show you my meaning clearly to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the second my number one the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at first that a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company
p01705_A,01705,A,it s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses my best hand was taken from me yesterday morning
p01706_A,01706,A,no no not so bad as that not quite so bad
p01707_A,01707,A,wanted yes he was wanted
p01708_A,01708,A,no not very he was charged with attempting to pick a pocket and they found a silver snuff box on him his own my dear his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it they remanded him till to day for they thought they knew the owner ah he was worth fifty boxes and i d give the price of as many to have him back you should have known the dodger my dear you should have known the dodger
p01709_A,01709,A,i m doubtful about it if they don t get any fresh evidence it ll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do it s a case of lagging they know what a clever lad he is he ll be a lifer they ll make the artful nothing less than a lifer
p01710_A,01710,A,really nothing my dear really nothing
p01711_A,01711,A,you can talk as you eat can t you
p01712_A,01712,A,out i sent her out this morning with the other young woman because i wanted us to be alone
p01713_A,01713,A,you did well yesterday my dear beautiful six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you
p01714_A,01714,A,no no my dear the pint pots were great strokes of genius but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece
p01715_A,01715,A,i want you bolter to do a piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution
p01716_A,01716,A,that s not the smallest danger in it not the very smallest it s only to dodge a woman
p01717_A,01717,A,a young one
p01718_A,01718,A,not to do anything but to tell me where she goes who she sees and if possible what she says to remember the street if it is a street or the house if it is a house and to bring me back all the information you can
p01719_A,01719,A,if you do it well a pound my dear one pound and that s what i never gave yet for any job of work where there wasn t valuable consideration to be gained
p01720_A,01720,A,one of us

p01814_A,01814,A,to humour me you re considerate indeed sir to humour me well well it s no matter
p01815_A,01815,A,i told you before that i was afraid to speak to you there i don t know why it is but i have such a fear and dread upon me to night that i can hardly stand
p01816_A,01816,A,no imagination i ll swear i saw coffin written in every page of the book in large black letters aye and they carried one close to me in the streets to night
p01817_A,01817,A,your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am to night and preached of flames and vengeance oh dear lady why ar n t those who claim to be god s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler
p01818_A,01818,A,i couldn t come i was kept by force
p01819_A,01819,A,him that i told the young lady of before
p01820_A,01820,A,no it s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldn t give him a drink of laudanum before i came away
p01821_A,01821,A,no and neither he nor any of them suspect me
p01822_A,01822,A,i am ready
p01823_A,01823,A,i am
p01824_A,01824,A,i will not do it i will never do it devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that
p01825_A,01825,A,for one reason for one reason that the lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and i ll not turn upon them who might any of them have turned upon me but didn t bad as they are
p01826_A,01826,A,what if he turns against the others
p01827_A,01827,A,and if it is not
p01828_A,01828,A,monks would never learn how you knew what you do
p01829_A,01829,A,i have been a liar and among liars from a little child but i will take your words he is tall and a strongly made man but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly looks over his shoulder first on one side and then on the other don t forget that for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man s that you might almost tell him by that alone his face is dark like his hair and eyes and although he can t be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds why did you start part of this i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times he was covered up in a large cloak i think that s all i can give you to know him by stay though upon his throat so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face there is
p01830_A,01830,A,how s this you know him
p01831_A,01831,A,nothing sir you can do nothing to help me i am past all hope indeed
p01832_A,01832,A,home lady to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole life let us part i shall be watched or seen go go if i have done you any service all i ask is that you leave me and let me go my way alone
p01833_A,01833,A,this is far enough i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but you see i am willing to humour you
p01834_A,01834,A,why for what for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place why not have let me speak to you above there where it is light and there is something stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole
p01835_A,01835,A,a fear of what
p01836_A,01836,A,there is nothing unusual in that they have passed me often
p01837_A,01837,A,ah a turk turns his face after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first you were not here last sunday night
p01838_A,01838,A,by whom
p01839_A,01839,A,you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to night i hope
p01840_A,01840,A,did he awake before you returned
p01841_A,01841,A,good now listen to me
p01842_A,01842,A,this young lady has communicated to me and to some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are
p01843_A,01843,A,that man must be delivered up by you
p01844_A,01844,A,tell me why
p01845_A,01845,A,then put monks into my hands and leave him to me to deal with
p01846_A,01846,A,i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in oliver s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free
p01847_A,01847,A,then this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it
p01848_A,01848,A,never the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess
p01849_A,01849,A,a broad red mark like a burn or scald
p01850_A,01850,A,you will not persist in saying that think now tell me
p01851_A,01851,A,i fear not my dear
p01852_A,01852,A,it is useless we compromise her safety perhaps by staying here we may have detained her longer than she expected already
p01853_A,01853,A,why that she couldn t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to and so the first time she went to see the lady she ha ha ha it made me laugh when she said it that it did she gave him a drink of laudanum
p01854_A,01854,A,and what be that stoof good to eat harry
p01855_A,01855,A,it s all bought up as fast as it can be made there are fourteen water mills six steam engines and a galvanic battery always a working upon it and they can t make it fast enough though the men work so hard that they die off and the widows is pensioned directly with twenty pound a year for each of the children and a premium of fifty for twins one penny a square two half pence is all the same and four farthings is received with joy one penny a square wine stains fruit stains beer stains water stains paint stains pitch stains mud stains blood stains here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company that i ll take clean out before he can order me a pint of ale
p01856_A,01856,A,hah give that back
p01857_A,01857,A,that s for your people now look alive in there will you damn that ere bag it warn t ready night afore last this won t do you know
p01858_A,01858,A,anything new up in town ben
p01859_A,01859,A,oh that s quite true and a dreadful murder it was
p01860_A,01860,A,a woman it is supposed
p01861_A,01861,A,now ben
p01862_A,01862,A,he knows the alternative if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him drag him into the street call for the aid of the police and impeach him as a felon in my name
p01863_A,01863,A,how dare you urge me to it young man are you mad enough to leave this house unhand him there sir you are free to go and we to follow but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery i am resolute and immoveable if you are determined to be the same your blood be upon your own head
p01864_A,01864,A,by mine those persons are indemnified by me if you complain of being deprived of your liberty you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet i say again throw yourself for protection on the law i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have passed into other hands and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed yourself you will decide quickly if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a shudder foresee i cannot control once more i say for you know the way if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those you have deeply injured seat yourself without a word in that chair it has waited for you two whole days you will be prompt a word from me and the alternative has gone for ever i have not the inclination to parley and as i advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right
p01865_A,01865,A,none lock the door on the outside and come when i ring
p01866_A,01866,A,it is because i was your father s oldest friend young man it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely man it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters s death bed when he was yet a boy on the morning that would but heaven willed otherwise have made her my young wife it is because my seared heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and errors till he died it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently now yes edward leeford even now and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name
p01867_A,01867,A,nothing nothing to you but it was hers and even at this distance of time brings back to me an old man the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger i am very glad you have changed it very very
p01868_A,01868,A,you have a brother a brother the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm
p01869_A,01869,A,attend to what i do know and you may not i shall interest you by and by i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole and most unnatural issue
p01870_A,01870,A,but i also know the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume your mother succeeded she forgot it soon but it rusted and cankered at your father s heart for years
p01871_A,01871,A,when they had been separated for some time and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends this circumstance at least you know already
p01872_A,01872,A,your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness i speak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than eleven years old and your father but one and thirty for he was i repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth
p01873_A,01873,A,these new friends then were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some half a year before and left him with two children there had been more but of all their family happily but two survived they were both daughters one a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or three years old
p01874_A,01874,A,they resided in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your father was gifted as few men are he had his sister s soul and person as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him i would that it had ended there his daughter did the same the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless girl
p01875_A,01875,A,it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are often it is no uncommon case died and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefs money it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no will no will so that the whole property fell to her and you before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way he came to me
p01876_A,01876,A,by me i told you i should interest you before long i say by me i see that your cunning associate suppressed my name although for aught he knew it would be quite strange to your ears when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history
p01877_A,01877,A,denial to me is vain i shall show you that i know more than that
p01878_A,01878,A,we shall see i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indies whither as you well know you retired upon your mother s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here i made the voyage you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where i returned your agents had no clue to your residence you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy i wearied them with new applications i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant
p01879_A,01879,A,i did not but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all you have a brother you know it and him there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father you repaired to the place of his birth there existed proofs proofs long suppressed of his birth and parentage those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son coward liar you who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night you whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you you who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father s heart and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind you edward leeford do you still brave me
p01880_A,01880,A,every word every word that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party
p01881_A,01881,A,it was the partial disclosure of your secrets will you disclose the whole
p01882_A,01882,A,set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses
p01883_A,01883,A,remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it
p01884_A,01884,A,have you made up your mind
p01885_A,01885,A,this is a painful task but these declarations which have been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance repeated here i would have spared you the degradation but we must hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why
p01886_A,01886,A,this child is your half brother the illegitimate son of your father my dear friend edwin leeford by poor young agnes fleming who died in giving him birth
p01887_A,01887,A,the term you use is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world it reflects disgrace on no one living except you who use it let that pass he was born in this town

p01924_A,01924,A,the letter a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery to be explained one day prevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back she was at that time within a few months of her confinement he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her prayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done before and then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted i believe he had
p01925_A,01925,A,my mother did what a woman should have done she burnt this will the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot the girl s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate i love her for it now could add goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke
p01926_A,01926,A,there she died after a lingering illness and on her death bed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallows foot she was right he came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began

p00106_B,00106,B,i hope i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child
p00107_B,00107,B,the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it
p00108_B,00108,B,by the bye you don t know anybody who wants a boy do you a porochial prentis who is at present a dead weight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms
p00109_B,00109,B,juries juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches
p00110_B,00110,B,yes i think it rather pretty the die is the same as the porochial seal the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on newyear s morning mr sowerberry i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight
p00111_B,00111,B,promptness indeed but what s the consequence what s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir why the husband sends back word that the medicine won t suit his wife s complaint and so she shan t take it says she shan t take it sir good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coal heaver only a week before sent em for nothing with a blackin bottle in and he sends back word that she shan t take it sir
p00112_B,00112,B,just so
p00113_B,00113,B,oh it s sickening antimonial mr sowerberry
p00114_B,00114,B,they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that
p00115_B,00115,B,come my good fellow they want to shut up the yard
p00116_B,00116,B,obstinate people mr sowerberry very obstinate proud too i m afraid sir
p00117_B,00117,B,for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards
p00118_B,00118,B,hem well
p00119_B,00119,B,you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry i say you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry
p00120_B,00120,B,so are the coffins
p00121_B,00121,B,we only heard of the family the night before last and we shouldn t have known anything about them then only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blacking bottle offhand
p00122_B,00122,B,i despise em
p00123_B,00123,B,well what about the boy
p00124_B,00124,B,and i only wish we d a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em
p00125_B,00125,B,tush foolery if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk they d have enough to do
p00126_B,00126,B,never did sir no nor nobody never did but now she s dead we ve got to bury her and that s the direction and the sooner it s done the better
p00127_B,00127,B,well well every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable
p00128_B,00128,B,no one else mr sowerberry here i ve brought the boy
p00129_B,00129,B,gadso that s just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you know dear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble i never noticed it before
p00130_B,00130,B,so they are
p00131_B,00131,B,i recollect the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didn t they and they made it a special verdict i think by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had
p00132_B,00132,B,well i ne ver did
p00133_B,00133,B,though i must say though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over one s calculation makes a great hole in one s profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir
p00134_B,00134,B,so it is
p00135_B,00135,B,no more they have
p00136_B,00136,B,well oliver how do you like it
p00137_B,00137,B,proud eh come that s too much
p00138_B,00138,B,bayton i never heard the name before
p00139_B,00139,B,well i was thinking that if i pay so much towards em i ve a right to get as much out of em as i can mr bumble and so i think i ll take the boy myself
p00140_B,00140,B,think so the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble
p00141_B,00141,B,well well mr bumble there s no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble well seasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham
p00142_B,00142,B,ah there s promptness
p00143_B,00143,B,so do i
p00144_B,00144,B,oh why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poor s rates
p00145_B,00145,B,let em alone for that
p00146_B,00146,B,very true they would indeed
p00147_B,00147,B,why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you
p00148_B,00148,B,of course of course and if i don t get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you see he he he
p00149_B,00149,B,oh that s the boy is it mrs sowerberry will you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear my dear this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of

p00157_B,00157,B,it s not madness ma am it s meat
p00158_B,00158,B,ah the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so till he s a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship he comes of a bad family excitable natures mrs sowerberry both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed woman weeks before

p01038_B,01038,B,mrs corney out of door relief properly managed properly managed ma am is the porochial safeguard the great principle of out of door relief is to give the paupers exactly what they don t want and then they get tired of coming
p01039_B,01039,B,if i thought it was if i thought as any one of em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance

p01042_B,01042,B,they had better not let me see any man porochial or extra porochial as would presume to do it and i can tell him that he wouldn t do it a second time
p01043_B,01043,B,then take something ma am a little of the wine
p01044_B,01044,B,to obey ma am your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now i wish he was poor man it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper so cry away
p01045_B,01045,B,mrs corney ma am i mean to say this ma am that any cat or kitten that could live with you ma am and not be fond of its home must be a ass ma am

p01055_B,01055,B,when indeed ma am why here s one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight is he grateful ma am is he grateful not a copper farthing s worth of it what does he do ma am but ask for a few coals if it s only a pocket handkerchief full he says coals what would he do with coals toast his cheese with em and then come back for more that s the way with these people ma am give em a apron full of coals to day and they ll come back for another the day after to morrow as brazen as alabaster i never see anything like the pitch it s got to the day afore yesterday a man you have been a married woman ma am and i may mention it to you a man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseer s door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney as he wouldn t go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal my heart says the ungrateful villain what s the use of this to me you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you won t get anything else here then i ll die in the streets says the vagrant oh no you won t says our overseer
p01056_B,01056,B,well what s that to me i can t keep her alive can i
p01057_B,01057,B,no no mistress nobody can she s far beyond the reach of help i ve seen a many people die little babes and great strong men and i know when death s a coming well enough but she s troubled in her mind and when the fits are not on her and that s not often for she is dying very hard she says she has got something to tell which you must hear she ll never die quiet till you come mistress

p01062_B,01062,B,oh it s all u p there mrs corney
p01063_B,01063,B,if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised it s a break up of the system altogether is she dozing old lady then perhaps she ll go off in that way if you don t make a row put the light on the floor she won t see it there
p01064_B,01064,B,not a word she plucked and tore at her arms for a little time but i held her hands and she soon dropped off she hasn t much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet i ain t so weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance no no
p01065_B,01065,B,i tried to get it down but her teeth were tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again so i drank it and it did me good
p01066_B,01066,B,ay that she would she had a merry heart a many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as waxwork my old eyes have seen them ay and those old hands touched them too for i have helped her scores of times
p01067_B,01067,B,i mind the time when she would have done the same and made rare fun of it afterwards

p01115_B,01115,B,curse him no or he would have been a thief long ago
p01116_B,01116,B,it s no fault of mine if he is mind that fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death i told you from the first i won t shed blood it s always found out and haunts a man besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me fire this infernal den what s that
p01117_B,01117,B,i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once
p01118_B,01118,B,yes i have been lingering here these two hours where the devil have you been
p01119_B,01119,B,why do you mean to say you couldn t have done it if you had chosen haven t you done it with other boys scores of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldn t you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life
p01120_B,01120,B,throttle the girl
p01121_B,01121,B,that was not my doing
p01122_B,01122,B,yonder the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath
p01123_B,01123,B,that wasn t my doing the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole
p01124_B,01124,B,oh of course well and what s come of it
p01125_B,01125,B,what then
p01126_B,01126,B,i ll swear i saw it it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away
p01127_B,01127,B,nothing bad i hope it s as dark as the grave make haste
p01128_B,01128,B,he could i mistake him think you if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to point him out if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across his grave i fancy i should know if there wasn t a mark above it that he lay buried there
p01129_B,01129,B,not bad any way i have been prompt enough this time let me have a word with you
p01130_B,01130,B,i had no hold upon him to make him worse his hand was not in i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all
p01131_B,01131,B,what where
p01132_B,01132,B,only hear him
p01133_B,01133,B,on your business my dear on your business all night
p01134_B,01134,B,whose turn would that have served my dear
p01135_B,01135,B,why we can t afford to do that just now my dear and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden she ll care no more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if he is alive i can make him one from this time and if if it s not likely mind but if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead
p01136_B,01136,B,no no my dear and i don t quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him
p01137_B,01137,B,it s your fancy
p01138_B,01138,B,we can say the few words we ve got to say in here my dear and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours we ll set the candle on the stairs there
p01139_B,01139,B,nothing good
p01140_B,01140,B,i saw it was not easy to train him to the business he was not like other boys in the same circumstances
p01141_B,01141,B,what do you think now besides ourselves there s not a creature in the house except toby and the boys and they re safe enough see here
p01142_B,01142,B,shut the door
p01143_B,01143,B,why nance how pale you are
p01144_B,01144,B,a boy what s the matter with the eh why brittles look here don t you know
p01145_B,01145,B,my advice or leastways i should say my orders is that we mediately go home again
p01146_B,01146,B,speak for yourself sir
p01147_B,01147,B,of shoes sir seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room i says when i had woke him
p01148_B,01148,B,i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles
p01149_B,01149,B,i an t
p01150_B,01150,B,i shouldn t wonder if it was
p01151_B,01151,B,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p01152_B,01152,B,more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater
p01153_B,01153,B,you re a falsehood mr giles
p01154_B,01154,B,so you did
p01155_B,01155,B,in a lantern miss
p01156_B,01156,B,i shouldn t wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen mr giles ought to know
p01157_B,01157,B,so am i only there s no call to tell a man he is so bounceably
p01158_B,01158,B,certainly and whatever mr giles says it isn t our place to contradict him no no i know my sitiwation thank my stars i know my sitiwation
p01159_B,01159,B,you are afraid brittles
p01160_B,01160,B,you are
p01161_B,01161,B,but it s wonderful what a man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i know i should if we d caught one of them rascals i know what it was it was the gate
p01162_B,01162,B,brittles is right from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so it was a knock open the door somebody it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning but the door must be opened do you hear somebody
p01163_B,01163,B,you may depend upon it that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it
p01164_B,01164,B,you re a lie brittles
p01165_B,01165,B,it was when you heerd it sir but at this time it had a busting sound i turned down the clothes sat up in bed and listened
p01166_B,01166,B,i says
p01167_B,01167,B,i ll tell you what it is gentlemen we re all afraid
p01168_B,01168,B,so i do it s natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am
p01169_B,01169,B,ladies present mr giles
p01170_B,01170,B,was he frightened
p01171_B,01171,B,what sort of a noise
p01172_B,01172,B,not a bit of it he was as firm ah pretty near as firm as i was
p01173_B,01173,B,a kind of a busting noise
p01174_B,01174,B,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p01175_B,01175,B,you re a woman
p01176_B,01176,B,not now for the world poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles for my sake
p01177_B,01177,B,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p01178_B,01178,B,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p01179_B,01179,B,wounded desperate miss
p01180_B,01180,B,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p01181_B,01181,B,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p01182_B,01182,B,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p01183_B,01183,B,he is always slow
p01184_B,01184,B,he gets worse instead of better i think
p01185_B,01185,B,rose wished to see the man but i wouldn t hear of it
p01186_B,01186,B,oh no
p01187_B,01187,B,no no oh not ill i shall be better presently close the window pray
p01188_B,01188,B,i would not alarm you if i could avoid it but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt
p01189_B,01189,B,it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys
p01190_B,01190,B,nothing aunt nothing i don t know what it is i can t describe it but i feel
p01191_B,01191,B,the only friend i ever had the kindest best of friends my heart will burst i cannot bear all this
p01192_B,01192,B,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p01193_B,01193,B,i see it of course but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child
p01194_B,01194,B,you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself
p01195_B,01195,B,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p01196_B,01196,B,oh no aunt
p01197_B,01197,B,why not
p01198_B,01198,B,you believe it surely
p01199_B,01199,B,oh what is to be done dear dear why did they send for these people
p01200_B,01200,B,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p01201_B,01201,B,but at so early an age
p01202_B,01202,B,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p01203_B,01203,B,oh to be sure you shall have it immediately if you will
p01204_B,01204,B,but can you oh can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society but even if he has been wicked think how young he is think that he may never have known a mother s love or the comfort of a home that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt aunt dear aunt for mercy s sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment oh as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late
p01205_B,01205,B,oh yes aunt is is a bargain
p01206_B,01206,B,ah to be sure so there is that was your handiwork giles i understand honour eh well i don t know perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and you ve fought a duel giles gad that s true where is he show me the way i ll look in again as i come down mrs maylie that s the little window that he got in at eh well i couldn t have believed it this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie
p01207_B,01207,B,i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so but i don t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer nevertheless
p01208_B,01208,B,very good then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition
p01209_B,01209,B,because my pretty cross examiner because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a police officer on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentleman s house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself don t you see all this
p01210_B,01210,B,well that is no very difficult matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger now i make this stipulation that i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events
p01211_B,01211,B,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p01212_B,01212,B,i doubt it my dear young lady i don t think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one
p01213_B,01213,B,no of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them the more i think of it the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
p01214_B,01214,B,you seem to think that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to day except yourself miss rose i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present
p01215_B,01215,B,if it be necessary certainly not
p01216_B,01216,B,unless there is some other way of preserving the child
p01217_B,01217,B,let me go in god s name my dear child she is dead she is dying
p01218_B,01218,B,he is not in danger i hope
p01219_B,01219,B,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p01220_B,01220,B,we stay in town of course while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains
p01221_B,01221,B,you must compose yourself be calm my dear ma am pray
p01222_B,01222,B,why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the circumstances though i don t think he is have you seen the thief
p01223_B,01223,B,there is no other no other take my word for it
p01224_B,01224,B,all i know is that we must try and carry it off with a bold face the object is a good one and that must be our excuse the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more that s one comfort we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours come in
p01225_B,01225,B,vice takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her
p01226_B,01226,B,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p01227_B,01227,B,no as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come
p01228_B,01228,B,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p01229_B,01229,B,then i think it is necessary at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me miss rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour
p01230_B,01230,B,no surely my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others what can i do to save him sir
p01231_B,01231,B,not ill my love
p01232_B,01232,B,my child i never saw you so before
p01233_B,01233,B,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p01234_B,01234,B,why indeed i would not have had them here for the world
p01235_B,01235,B,you have borne more and have been through all the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew come come my love remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms poor child see here look look my dear
p01236_B,01236,B,i hope you don t mean to say sir that he s going to die if i thought it i should never be happy again i wouldn t cut a boy off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county sir
p01237_B,01237,B,it was all done for the for the best sir i am sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldn t have meddled with him i am not of an inhuman disposition sir

p01242_B,01242,B,the boy is very well sir and sends his respectful duty sir
p01243_B,01243,B,that s not the point mr giles are you a protestant
p01244_B,01244,B,nor catching any thieves nor identifying any house breakers
p01245_B,01245,B,well i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing admirably pray how is brittles
p01246_B,01246,B,so so i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles

p01256_B,01256,B,that s what it is sir
p01257_B,01257,B,here s the house broken into and a couple of men catch one moment s glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness here s a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him by doing which they place his life in great danger and swear he is the thief now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they place themselves i ask you again are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy
p01258_B,01258,B,open the door it s the officers from bow street as was sent to to day just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man he s in the gig a minding the prad have you got a coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you
p01259_B,01259,B,and what the devil s a put up thing
p01260_B,01260,B,this is the lady of the house
p01261_B,01261,B,what did jem spyers say
p01262_B,01262,B,perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie
p01263_B,01263,B,very curious indeed now if you please you can walk upstairs
p01264_B,01264,B,upon my word i hardly know what to do
p01265_B,01265,B,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p01266_B,01266,B,what shall it be
p01267_B,01267,B,this this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on mr what d ye call him s grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify you don t mean to deny that i suppose
p01268_B,01268,B,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p01269_B,01269,B,that s it master this is all about the robbery is it
p01270_B,01270,B,we call it a put up robbery ladies when the servants is in it
p01271_B,01271,B,a little drop of spirits master if it s all the same it s a cold ride from london ma am and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings
p01272_B,01272,B,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p01273_B,01273,B,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p01274_B,01274,B,jem spyers for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says said chickweed said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadn t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances
p01275_B,01275,B,if you please sir
p01276_B,01276,B,more likely on that wery account
p01277_B,01277,B,that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers
p01278_B,01278,B,you always gave that to him it was the family pet i tell you conkey hadn t any more to do with it than i had
p01279_B,01279,B,certainly not
p01280_B,01280,B,wery pretty indeed it is
p01281_B,01281,B,conkey means nosey ma am
p01282_B,01282,B,what a precious muddle headed chap you are
p01283_B,01283,B,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p01284_B,01284,B,wery easy disposed of if it is
p01285_B,01285,B,we find it was a town hand for the style of work is first rate
p01286_B,01286,B,that was something in this way warn t it that was done by conkey chickweed that was
p01287_B,01287,B,get out i know better do you mind that time when conkey was robbed of his money though what a start that was better than any novel book i ever see
p01288_B,01288,B,what he says is quite correct who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didn t drop out of the clouds did he master
p01289_B,01289,B,there was two of em in it and they had a boy with em that s plain from the size of the window that s all to be said at present we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please
p01290_B,01290,B,of course the lady knows that don t she always interrupting you are partner this here conkey chickweed miss kept a public house over battlebridge way and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting and badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for i ve seen em off en he warn t one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high he was wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they set up a hue and cry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i don t know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house said chickweed says spyers says the poor man spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moment s notice he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars out jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed a tearing down the street full cry away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner shoots round sees a little crowd dives in says chickweed it was a remarkable occurrence but he warn t to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public house next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again at last he couldn t help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed a roaring out off he starts once more with chickweed half way down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterday s one the man s lost again this was done once or twice more till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief
p01291_B,01291,B,nobody suspected them in this case
p01292_B,01292,B,wery likely not ma am but they might have been in it for all that
p01293_B,01293,B,it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon this here conkey chickweed
p01294_B,01294,B,why thank you miss it s dry work this sort of duty anythink that s handy miss don t put yourself out of the way on our accounts
p01295_B,01295,B,what was that

p01307_B,01307,B,i hope that nothing is the matter she don t look well to night but
p01308_B,01308,B,i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth
p01309_B,01309,B,to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care of me before if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure

p01314_B,01314,B,you will make me happier than i can tell you to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine do you understand me
p01315_B,01315,B,i am sure they would and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them
p01316_B,01316,B,i never thought you had told us anything but the truth but what is this of whom do you speak
p01317_B,01317,B,you shall give nothing at all for as i told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways and if you only take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make me very happy indeed

p01333_B,01333,B,my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day quite enough for both of us if we go to the book stall keeper s we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house on fire or run away no home again straight
p01334_B,01334,B,that s a fine fellow you shall come and see me when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone

p01347_B,01347,B,hush you think like a child poor boy but you teach me my duty notwithstanding i had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy god s will be done i love her and he knows how well we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne it must be carried to the market town which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know here is another letter but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know i would not forward it unless i feared the worst
p01348_B,01348,B,i think not i will wait until to morrow
p01349_B,01349,B,i hope not oliver i have been very happy with her for some years too happy perhaps it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune but i hope it is not this
p01350_B,01350,B,she is very ill now and will be worse i am sure my dear dear rose oh what shall i do without her
p01351_B,01351,B,surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful two hours ago she was quite well
p01352_B,01352,B,is it for chertsey too ma am
p01353_B,01353,B,not aunt i ll never call her aunt sister my own dear sister that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first rose dear darling rose

p01356_B,01356,B,i am sorry i hope i have not hurt you
p01357_B,01357,B,i beg your pardon sir i was in a great hurry to get home and didn t see you were coming
p01358_B,01358,B,rot you if i had only had the courage to say the word i might have been free of you in a night curses on your head and black death on your heart you imp what are you doing here
p01359_B,01359,B,death who would have thought it grind him to ashes he d start up from a stone coffin to come in my way
p01360_B,01360,B,is it you giles
p01361_B,01361,B,oh certainly sir i shall be proud to do it
p01362_B,01362,B,better much better
p01363_B,01363,B,as i am that the men were at the window the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
p01364_B,01364,B,i hope so sir
p01365_B,01365,B,that i missed them in an instant
p01366_B,01366,B,quite sir the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end
p01367_B,01367,B,oh quite sir quite
p01368_B,01368,B,oh no indeed sir i saw him too plainly for that i saw them both as plainly as i see you now
p01369_B,01369,B,i would not for the world sir indeed you may believe me mr losberne s words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come i heard him say so
p01370_B,01370,B,i should like to know how how my mother and miss maylie are and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether she they i mean seem happy and quite well you understand me
p01371_B,01371,B,thank heaven you are sure
p01372_B,01372,B,this is strange
p01373_B,01373,B,i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time i wish you would write to me say once a fort night every alternate monday to the general post office in london will you
p01374_B,01374,B,then they are in the ditch follow and keep as near me as you can
p01375_B,01375,B,you are quite certain there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled
p01376_B,01376,B,i would rather you did not mention it to them because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her let it be a secret between you and me and mind you tell me everything i depend upon you
p01377_B,01377,B,they took this way are you sure
p01378_B,01378,B,i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise giles i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her you can say i am coming
p01379_B,01379,B,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p01380_B,01380,B,well you can do as you like let him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen
p01381_B,01381,B,she shall
p01382_B,01382,B,that i leave you to discover i must go back to her god bless you
p01383_B,01383,B,you think so now harry
p01384_B,01384,B,i did but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losberne s opinion
p01385_B,01385,B,harry it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now
p01386_B,01386,B,no indeed you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already what i would say is this before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on rose s history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic
p01387_B,01387,B,not coldly far from it
p01388_B,01388,B,by and by when i leave rose
p01389_B,01389,B,i think my dear son that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting above all i think that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so
p01390_B,01390,B,if that had been the case harry i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import
p01391_B,01391,B,i will not but i would have you consider
p01392_B,01392,B,of course
p01393_B,01393,B,i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty
p01394_B,01394,B,no i will tell her all
p01395_B,01395,B,there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother
p01396_B,01396,B,i shall see you again to night
p01397_B,01397,B,and ever will the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little
p01398_B,01398,B,but why why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if rose had i cannot utter that word now if this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself how could i ever have know happiness again
p01399_B,01399,B,let it rest with rose then you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way
p01400_B,01400,B,what do you mean
p01401_B,01401,B,how then she has formed no other attachment
p01402_B,01402,B,you will tell her i am here
p01403_B,01403,B,mother he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus
p01404_B,01404,B,and who can wonder if it be so mother or why should i say if it is it is you know it mother you must know it
p01405_B,01405,B,i have considered mother i have considered years and years i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave this place rose shall hear me
p01406_B,01406,B,and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her you will not refuse to do this mother
p01407_B,01407,B,this is unkind mother do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
p01408_B,01408,B,the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him
p01409_B,01409,B,halloa something very short of flying will keep pace with me do you hear
p01410_B,01410,B,strange blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it
p01411_B,01411,B,i hope i may have good cause to do so though i confess i don t think i shall but yesterday morning you had made up your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your mother like a dutiful son to the sea side before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london and at night you urge me with great mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds too bad isn t it oliver
p01412_B,01412,B,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p01413_B,01413,B,we shall see
p01414_B,01414,B,a few a very few will suffice rose what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated i i ought to have left here before
p01415_B,01415,B,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p01416_B,01416,B,the great nobs under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them
p01417_B,01417,B,you have a right to know them you can say nothing to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it alike to others and to myself
p01418_B,01418,B,if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved i could have
p01419_B,01419,B,yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world
p01420_B,01420,B,oh harry harry i wish i could and spare myself this pain
p01421_B,01421,B,it is that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love look into the world think how many hearts you would be proud to gain are there confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful friend you have
p01422_B,01422,B,the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should to night it is a struggle but one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear
p01423_B,01423,B,i could stay why should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry as we have met to day we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you
p01424_B,01424,B,what do you mean
p01425_B,01425,B,i did
p01426_B,01426,B,stay you do know all
p01427_B,01427,B,not to press me to alter my right determination it will be useless
p01428_B,01428,B,you should indeed forgive me for saying so but i wish you had
p01429_B,01429,B,i did not mean that i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you
p01430_B,01430,B,the disclosure of to night leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before
p01431_B,01431,B,the prospect before you is a brilliant one all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life are in store for you but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place in a word there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me
p01432_B,01432,B,then if your lot had been differently cast if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger i must leave you now indeed
p01433_B,01433,B,do not press me to reply the question does not arise and never will it is unfair almost unkind to urge it
p01434_B,01434,B,they do not
p01435_B,01435,B,and what have i heard what have i heard that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all there we have said enough harry we have said enough
p01436_B,01436,B,your behaviour has ever been kind and noble as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer
p01437_B,01437,B,then let it be so it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better
p01438_B,01438,B,not to press you to alter your determination but to hear you repeat it if you would i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or act to seek to change it
p01439_B,01439,B,if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty
p01440_B,01440,B,to yourself
p01441_B,01441,B,then why inflict it on yourself think dear rose think what you have heard to night
p01442_B,01442,B,another word rose your reason in your own words from your own lips let me hear it
p01443_B,01443,B,have received this declaration very differently do not conceal that from me at least rose
p01444_B,01444,B,i mean but this that when i left you last i left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn from it this i have done those who have shrunk from me because of this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right such power and patronage such relatives of influence and rank as smiled upon me then look coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in england s richest county and by one village church mine rose my own there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold this is my rank and station now and here i lay it down
p01445_B,01445,B,no to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it
p01446_B,01446,B,i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming a creature a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels fluttered between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved you these were distractions almost too great to bear they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course you recovered day by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind
p01447_B,01447,B,the disclosure of to night
p01448_B,01448,B,you harden your heart against me rose
p01449_B,01449,B,one word more rose dearest rose one more if i had been less less fortunate the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if i had been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth
p01450_B,01450,B,i ask one promise once and only once more say within a year but it may be much sooner i may speak to you again on this subject for the last time
p01451_B,01451,B,if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this one question
p01452_B,01452,B,and your reasons rose your reasons for this decision
p01453_B,01453,B,there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours rose my own dear rose for years for years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy s attachment and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer
p01454_B,01454,B,then you return my love say but that dear rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment
p01455_B,01455,B,not yet not yet my hopes my wishes prospects feeling every thought in life except my love for you have undergone a change i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a home a heart and home yes dearest rose and those and those alone are all i have to offer
p01456_B,01456,B,it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose
p01457_B,01457,B,all you gave me leave at any time within a year to renew the subject of our last discourse
p01458_B,01458,B,we we were only cooling ourselves
p01459_B,01459,B,not too strong
p01460_B,01460,B,i suppose a married man is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner
p01461_B,01461,B,twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides

p01495_B,01495,B,perhaps there may
p01496_B,01496,B,in good time i ll tell you i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge
p01497_B,01497,B,there it has the word agnes engraved on the inside there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born i found out that
p01498_B,01498,B,she didn t utter another word but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper
p01499_B,01499,B,the child was the one you named to him last night the mother this nurse had robbed
p01500_B,01500,B,i spoke as plainly as i could it s not a large sum either

p01505_B,01505,B,what do you propose to do with it can it be used against me
p01506_B,01506,B,when this woman that we called old sally died she and i were alone
p01507_B,01507,B,in death she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infant s sake
p01508_B,01508,B,such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last
p01509_B,01509,B,she spoke of a young creature who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying
p01510_B,01510,B,nothing it was a pawnbroker s duplicate
p01511_B,01511,B,is that the man then mind what i told you and be careful to say as little as you can or you ll betray us at once

p01513_B,01513,B,you can easily take it away again i am but a woman alone here and unprotected
p01514_B,01514,B,as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this she fell back and died
p01515_B,01515,B,you had better bid i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to what s it worth to you
p01516_B,01516,B,all i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at and i want to know nothing for it s safer not but i may ask you two questions may i
p01517_B,01517,B,about the mother of the boy you named yes

p01520_B,01520,B,and this is all
p01521_B,01521,B,you may ask but whether i answer or not is another question
p01522_B,01522,B,which contained
p01523_B,01523,B,in life
p01524_B,01524,B,not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when it s told and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more
p01525_B,01525,B,five and twenty pounds
p01526_B,01526,B,i thought as much when you came in so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that there s only one will between them i m in earnest see here now gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the house top is gone let s hear your story

p01575_B,01575,B,but what can i do to what use can i turn this communication without you back why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay
p01576_B,01576,B,stay another moment think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touch is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation

p01581_B,01581,B,what dreadful things are these
p01582_B,01582,B,if it be painful to him to come back here how painful it will be to me but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting me he did when he went away i hardly thought he would but it was better for us both
p01583_B,01583,B,is it possible that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is madness

p01596_B,01596,B,do not speak thus pray
p01597_B,01597,B,yes why
p01598_B,01598,B,your having interfered in this dear boy s behalf before your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed oh do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the first the first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things
p01599_B,01599,B,hark did she call i thought i heard her voice
p01600_B,01600,B,he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i did and i saw him no more till last night
p01601_B,01601,B,no i have not done this for money let me have that to think of and yet give me something that you have worn i should like to have something no no not a ring your gloves or handkerchief anything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet lady there bless you god bless you good night good night
p01602_B,01602,B,then he goes by some other amongst us which i more than thought before some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monks the man i asked you about you know
p01603_B,01603,B,monks would never learn how you knew what you do
p01604_B,01604,B,i ll tell you lady last night he came again again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were these they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now he d rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides
p01605_B,01605,B,what look before you lady look at that dark water how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them it may be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last
p01606_B,01606,B,i wish to go back i must go back because how can i tell such things to an innocent lady like you because among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i can t leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now
p01607_B,01607,B,when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are give away your hearts love will carry you all lengths even such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us pity us lady pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering
p01608_B,01608,B,he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this i must get back quickly
p01609_B,01609,B,not a penny
p01610_B,01610,B,you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do
p01611_B,01611,B,heaven bless you for your goodness if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard do you know a man named monks
p01612_B,01612,B,thank heaven upon your knees dear lady that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness and and something worse than all as i have been from my cradle i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed
p01613_B,01613,B,you would serve me best lady if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am to night than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine
p01614_B,01614,B,i don t know what it is i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last
p01615_B,01615,B,it is i cannot leave him now i could not be his death
p01616_B,01616,B,every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve i will walk on london bridge if i am alive
p01617_B,01617,B,the truth lady though it comes from my lips then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldn t he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet he says
p01618_B,01618,B,nothing could save him if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel
p01619_B,01619,B,your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am to night and preached of flames and vengeance oh dear lady why ar n t those who claim to be god s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler
p01620_B,01620,B,oh lady lady if there was more like you there would be fewer like me there would there would
p01621_B,01621,B,let me stand lady and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late is is that door shut
p01622_B,01622,B,those were his words and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your two legged spaniel was
p01623_B,01623,B,will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed
p01624_B,01624,B,you should lady and i know you will you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done
p01625_B,01625,B,that monks had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldn t make out why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
p01626_B,01626,B,it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors should good night good night
p01627_B,01627,B,because i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagin s on the night he went out from the house in pentonville
p01628_B,01628,B,lady dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late
p01629_B,01629,B,i believe that at this period of our interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again
p01630_B,01630,B,she will be persuaded now she hesitates i am sure
p01631_B,01631,B,if they have i do not know how they can but if they have any reference to me pray let me hear them at some other time i have not strength or spirits now
p01632_B,01632,B,mr brownlow i believe sir
p01633_B,01633,B,he is waiting in a coach at the door
p01634_B,01634,B,do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heaven s name put me in possession of it
p01635_B,01635,B,i fear not my dear
p01636_B,01636,B,no my love she has not moved and will not till we are gone
p01637_B,01637,B,that is my name this is my friend mr grimwig grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes
p01638_B,01638,B,at this door
p01639_B,01639,B,nay you have more fortitude than this i am sure do you know this young lady sir
p01640_B,01640,B,he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over
p01641_B,01641,B,i m only sixty one and as the devil s in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i don t see the application of that remark
p01642_B,01642,B,do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray the promise shall be kept i don t think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself i should like to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves
p01643_B,01643,B,not exactly that but we must proceed gently and with great care
p01644_B,01644,B,very good but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest or at least to oliver s which is the same thing
p01645_B,01645,B,fagin what of him
p01646_B,01646,B,i will give fifty more and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it where is mr maylie
p01647_B,01647,B,the murderer
p01648_B,01648,B,have you made up your mind
p01649_B,01649,B,you see placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about
p01650_B,01650,B,never mind where but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view
p01651_B,01651,B,we must put it to the vote who may he be
p01652_B,01652,B,all that i could hope to do and even more coupling the poor girl s intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friend s inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day write and appoint the evening after to morrow at seven for the meeting we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature which way have they taken
p01653_B,01653,B,simply the discovery of oliver s parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived
p01654_B,01654,B,gentleness and care i d send them one and all to
p01655_B,01655,B,then i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really
p01656_B,01656,B,i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine
p01657_B,01657,B,yes yes his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness spies are hovering about in every direction i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government to night
p01658_B,01658,B,harry as soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them
p01659_B,01659,B,when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time they re sure of him
p01660_B,01660,B,hanging a few of them at least in all probability and transporting the rest
p01661_B,01661,B,what object
p01662_B,01662,B,that lady s son and this young lady s very old friend
p01663_B,01663,B,drive straight to the office and you will be in time i will remain here
p01664_B,01664,B,ah i almost forgot that
p01665_B,01665,B,good and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate oliver s tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough come supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world
p01666_B,01666,B,that is the dabe of this ouse

p01723_B,01723,B,do you hear the gentleman charlotte
p01724_B,01724,B,pretty well i think for a beginner the pots i took off airy railings and the milk can was standing by itself outside a public house i thought it might get rusty with the rain or catch cold yer know eh ha ha ha
p01725_B,01725,B,ha ha lord that s the very thing
p01726_B,01726,B,don t they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes i don t think that would answer my purpose ain t there any other line open

p01735_B,01735,B,that about nancy you followed her
p01736_B,01736,B,in a little community like ours my dear we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people
p01737_B,01737,B,that stands to reason some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven it s neither my friend neither it s number one
p01738_B,01738,B,again tell it again
p01739_B,01739,B,i m doubtful about it if they don t get any fresh evidence it ll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do it s a case of lagging they know what a clever lad he is he ll be a lifer they ll make the artful nothing less than a lifer

p01743_B,01743,B,no i don t i m of the same importance to you as you are to yourself

p01746_B,01746,B,what advantage would it be to me to be anything else here let me have a word with you outside
p01747_B,01747,B,it couldn t possibly be done without
p01748_B,01748,B,that s not the smallest danger in it not the very smallest it s only to dodge a woman

p01868_B,01868,B,there she died after a lingering illness and on her death bed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallows foot she was right he came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began
