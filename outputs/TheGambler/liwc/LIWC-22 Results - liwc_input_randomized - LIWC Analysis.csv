p00022_A,00022,A,To the German method of heaping up riches I have not been here very long but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood boil Good Lord I wish for no virtues of that kind Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere I found that things were even as we read of them in good German picture books that every house has its Vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable So honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and I cannot bear people of that sort Each such Vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud Over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching Do not be angry General Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that I can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother Yes I know how things ought to be done Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its Vater They work like oxen and amass wealth like Jews Suppose the Vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land Well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded For the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital Yes such things ARE done for I have been making inquiries on the subject It is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge What more have I to tell Well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden So the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while Gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated Then the Vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous Vater and the old story begins again In fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original Vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild or a Hoppe and Company or the devil knows what Is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all What is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves Yes there you have it in a nutshell For my own part I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette I have no wish to be Hoppe and Company at the end of five generations I want the money for myself for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital I may be wrong but there you have it Those are my views,1,72.91,61.35,14.48,9.03,3.45,0.13,0.53,3.05,1.33,5.44,7.84,15.54,9.3,4.52,7.84,1.46,5.18

p00025_A,00025,A,Not in the least You must know that when I was in Berlin I frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat and repellently prolong a certain phrase namely and happening to meet this couple in the carriage drive I found for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits Moreover on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot Not unnaturally I too possess a measure of self respect wherefore on this occasion I took off my hat and said politely yes I assure you it was said politely Then the Baron turned round and said whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in answer Twice I shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable That is all,1,75.15,59.76,18.34,11.24,8.88,0,1.18,1.18,0,7.1,9.47,13.02,5.92,5.33,7.1,1.18,5.33

p00170_A,00170,A,A maxim straight from the copybook Suppose I cannot comport myself with dignity By that I mean that though I am a man of self respect I am unable to carry off a situation properly Do you know the reason It is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression It is all a question of mode Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists It belongs only to the French though a few other Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons That is why with us the mode is so all important The Frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum That is why our good ladies are so fond of Frenchmen the Frenchman s manners they say are perfect But in my opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman s manners The Frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois At the same time as I am not a woman I do not properly understand the question Cocks may be excellent birds If I am wrong you must stop me You ought to stop and correct me more often when I am speaking to you for I am too apt to say everything that is in my head You see I have lost my manners I agree that I have none nor yet any dignity I will tell you why I set no store upon such things Everything in me has undergone a cheek You know the reason I have not a single human thought in my head For a long while I have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in Russia I have been to Dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is like You know the cause of my obsession I have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore I tell you outright that wherever I go I see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference Why or how I have come to love you I do not know It may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon Do you know I am ignorant even as to what your face is like In all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble,1,76.39,66.32,17.04,12.11,6.78,1.03,3.49,0.41,0.41,4.93,8.62,13.55,12.32,7.6,6.57,2.87,3.49

p00209_A,00209,A,I feel the same about it As for Mlle Polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests Even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances For my own part I think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially And as for Mlle Polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the Baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as Mlle Polina are to say the least of it unbecoming But she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter,1,80.5,65.41,18.24,11.95,1.89,0,5.03,3.77,0.63,6.29,4.4,18.24,7.55,5.03,8.18,1.89,6.29

p00213_A,00213,A,Also I may tell you that Mlle Blanche has been in Roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago I myself was in the place at the time and in those days Mlle Blanche was not known as Mlle de Cominges nor was her mother the Widow de Cominges even in existence In any case no one ever mentioned the latter De Griers too had not materialised and I am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance Likewise the Marquisate de Griers is of recent creation Of that I have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance Even the name De Griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that I have a friend who once met the said Marquis under a different name altogether,1,69.33,60,13.33,7.33,4,0,0.67,1.33,0.67,6,8,11.33,12,6.67,5.33,4.67,5.33

p00215_A,00215,A,Well I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an Italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name Barberini or something of the kind The fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage At first Mlle Blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum But worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all Also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous Upon this Mlle Zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini was in despair She shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count you must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts and the spectacle of Mlle Zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression So the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled Indeed that evening the couple entered the Casino arm in arm Mlle Zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown For instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside Doubtless you have noticed them,1,64.89,53.19,13.48,10.28,0.71,0,1.06,6.74,1.06,3.19,9.93,13.48,4.26,4.61,6.74,0,5.67
p00216_A,00216,A,Well they are not worth noticing To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart However Mlle Zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal Suddenly the Count too disappeared even as the Prince had done and that same evening Mlle Zelma was forced to appear in the Casino alone On this occasion no one offered her a greeting Two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval To his distaste however Mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request Mlle not to re enter the Casino If you feel in any way surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that I had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove Mlle Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa Now mark you Mlle wants to become Madame General in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years ago At present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players Yes that is a much more paying game I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also De Griers Or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her Consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated Mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself In short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental You form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle Polina Now do you understand,1,71.62,60.36,14.41,10.14,0.9,0,1.58,5.63,1.58,4.28,7.88,16.44,7.66,5.63,7.21,1.13,3.6
p00217_A,00217,A,It would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing Against what was I to warn you As likely as not the General knows more about Mlle Blanche even than I do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle Polina Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with De Griers while the General was careering in their wake on a roan horse He had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough As he passed I looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever However it is no affair of mine for I have only recently had the happiness to make Mlle Polina s acquaintance Also I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you,1,78.88,64.6,21.74,16.15,6.83,0,3.73,4.97,0.62,5.59,4.97,13.66,11.18,8.07,6.21,3.11,1.24

p00309_A,00309,A,Ah I see you are interested Mr Astley But it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface At the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance A Frenchman Mr Astley is merely a fine figure of a man With this you as a Britisher may not agree With it I also as a Russian may not agree out of envy Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion For instance one may look upon Racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and I too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule Yet about him Mr Astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it Yes the Frenchman the Parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a Parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance Yes taken by himself the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains Per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure Mr Astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him And even though it may offend you I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies At all events they need more experience For instance this Mlle Polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and I cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers She may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer De Griers This will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind Only give her the De Griers of former days and she will ask of you no more The more she may detest the present De Griers the more will she lament the De Griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination You are a sugar refiner Mr Astley are you not,1,70.42,59.64,13.56,9.15,1.14,0.98,1.8,4.9,0.16,4.41,8.33,14.38,8.99,5.72,8.33,1.8,4.08

p00242_B,00242,B,Ah I see you are interested Mr Astley But it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface At the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance A Frenchman Mr Astley is merely a fine figure of a man With this you as a Britisher may not agree With it I also as a Russian may not agree out of envy Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion For instance one may look upon Racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and I too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule Yet about him Mr Astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it Yes the Frenchman the Parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a Parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance Yes taken by himself the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains Per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure Mr Astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him And even though it may offend you I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies At all events they need more experience For instance this Mlle Polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and I cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers She may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer De Griers This will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind Only give her the De Griers of former days and she will ask of you no more The more she may detest the present De Griers the more will she lament the De Griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination You are a sugar refiner Mr Astley are you not,1,70.42,59.64,13.56,9.15,1.14,0.98,1.8,4.9,0.16,4.41,8.33,14.38,8.99,5.72,8.33,1.8,4.08
