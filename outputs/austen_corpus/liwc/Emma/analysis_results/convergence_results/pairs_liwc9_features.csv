00048,Emma,Harriet Smith,51,52,i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to being acquainted with his wife for though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates there can be no doubt of your being a gentleman s daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you,yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

00052,Emma,Harriet Smith,55,56,he is very plain undoubtedly remarkably plain but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,Harriet Smith,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
00053,Harriet Smith,Emma,56,57,to be sure he is not so genteel as real gentlemen,i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before do not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here,Emma,F,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00055,Harriet Smith,Emma,58,59,certainly he is not like mr knightley he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley i see the difference plain enough but mr knightley is so very fine a man,mr knightley s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to what say you to mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent you must see the difference,Emma,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00057,Harriet Smith,Emma,60,61,oh yes there is a great difference but mr weston is almost an old man mr weston must be between forty and fifty,which makes his good manners the more valuable the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes what is passable in youth is detestable in later age mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life,Emma,F,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00061,Harriet Smith,Emma,64,65,will he indeed that will be very bad,how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be for a thriving man what has he to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in time and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us,Emma,F,major,F,major,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00063,Harriet Smith,Emma,66,67,i wonder he did not remember the book,in one respect perhaps mr elton s manners are superior to mr knightley s or mr weston s they have more gentleness they might be more safely held up as a pattern there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much good humour with it but that would not do to be copied neither would mr knightley s downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model mr elton is good humoured cheerful obliging and gentle he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be if he means any thing it must be to please you did not i tell you what he said of you the other day,Emma,F,major,F,major,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00179,Emma,Mr. Knightley,190,191,i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing what think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
00180,Mr. Knightley,Emma,191,192,a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentleman farmer,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
00181,Emma,Mr. Knightley,192,193,as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune her allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort that she is a gentleman s daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemen s daughters no one i apprehend will deny she is superior to mr robert martin,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00182,Mr. Knightley,Emma,193,194,whoever might be her parents whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddard s hands to shift as she can to move in short in mrs goddard s line to have mrs goddard s acquaintance her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough she desired nothing better herself till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer she had no sense of superiority then if she has it now you have given it you have been no friend to harriet smith emma robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him i know him well he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know depend upon it he had encouragement,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00183,Emma,Mr. Knightley,194,195,you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet harriet s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice her good nature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
00184,Mr. Knightley,Emma,195,196,upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00185,Emma,Mr. Knightley,196,197,to be sure i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00186,Mr. Knightley,Emma,197,198,i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlour boarder at mrs goddard s all the rest of her life or at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writing master s son,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00187,Emma,Mr. Knightley,198,199,we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it we shall only be making each other more angry but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbey mill find him disagreeable but the case is altered now she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00188,Mr. Knightley,Emma,199,200,nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked robert martin s manners have sense sincerity and good humour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand robert martin has no great loss if he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain depend upon it elton will not do elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match he knows the value of a good income as well as any body elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriet s he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece,i am very much obliged to you if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself i have done with match making indeed i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls i shall leave off while i am well,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00361,Emma,Mrs. Weston,389,390,he ought to come if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young man s not having it in his power to do as much as that a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young man s being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it,one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,Mrs. Weston,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00363,Emma,Mrs. Weston,391,392,but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all,my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be,Mrs. Weston,F,major,F,intermediate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00384,Emma,Mr. Knightley,419,420,that s easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage,it is not to be conceived that a man of three or four and twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount he cannot want money he cannot want leisure we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom we hear of him for ever at some watering place or other a little while ago he was at weymouth this proves that he can leave the churchills,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00387,Mr. Knightley,Emma,422,423,and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure,it is very unfair to judge of any body s conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchill s temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,Emma,M,major,F,major,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

00389,Mr. Knightley,Emma,424,425,there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion i shall therefore set off to morrow if he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00390,Emma,Mr. Knightley,425,426,no but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man entirely dependent to use nobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for him standing up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he could how can you imagine such conduct practicable,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00391,Mr. Knightley,Emma,426,427,depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims respect for right conduct is felt by every body if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
00392,Emma,Mr. Knightley,427,428,i rather doubt that you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,Mr. Knightley,F,major,M,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
00393,Mr. Knightley,Emma,428,429,then it would not be so strong a sense if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,oh the difference of situation and habit i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life,Emma,M,major,F,major,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
