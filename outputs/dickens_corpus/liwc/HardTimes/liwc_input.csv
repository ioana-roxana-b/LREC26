p00020_A,00020,A,fact fact fact
p00021_A,00021,A,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure
p00022_A,00022,A,louisa thomas in the name of wonder idleness and folly what do you do here
p00023_A,00023,A,wanted to see what it was like
p00024_A,00024,A,what it was like
p00025_A,00025,A,yes father
p00026_A,00026,A,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00027_A,00027,A,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00028_A,00028,A,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00029_A,00029,A,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00030_A,00030,A,tired of what
p00031_A,00031,A,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00032_A,00032,A,i hadn t a shoe to my foot as to a stocking i didn t know such a thing by name i passed the day in a ditch and the night in a pigsty that s the way i spent my tenth birthday not that a ditch was new to me for i was born in a ditch
p00033_A,00033,A,enough to give a baby cold
p00034_A,00034,A,well what s the matter what is young thomas in the dumps about
p00035_A,00035,A,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00036_A,00036,A,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00037_A,00037,A,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00038_A,00038,A,that s the reason
p00039_A,00039,A,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly
p00040_A,00040,A,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00041_A,00041,A,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00042_A,00042,A,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00043_A,00043,A,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00044_A,00044,A,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00045_A,00045,A,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00046_A,00046,A,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00047_A,00047,A,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00048_A,00048,A,cecilia jupe by name
p00049_A,00049,A,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00050_A,00050,A,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00051_A,00051,A,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00052_A,00052,A,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00053_A,00053,A,pray mrs gradgrind what passed
p00054_A,00054,A,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00055_A,00055,A,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00056_A,00056,A,i am much of your opinion
p00057_A,00057,A,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00058_A,00058,A,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00059_A,00059,A,it s all right now louisa it s all right young thomas you won t do so any more i ll answer for it s being all over with father well louisa that s worth a kiss isn t it
p00060_A,00060,A,you can take one mr bounderby
p00061_A,00061,A,always my pet ain t you louisa good bye louisa
p00062_A,00062,A,what are you about loo you ll rub a hole in your face
p00063_A,00063,A,halloa stop where are you going stop why are you tearing about the streets in this improper manner
p00064_A,00064,A,i was i was run after sir and i wanted to get away
p00065_A,00065,A,what do you mean boy what are you doing how dare you dash against everybody in this manner was this boy running after you jupe
p00066_A,00066,A,yes sir
p00067_A,00067,A,no i wasn t sir not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say it s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn t known to the horse riders
p00068_A,00068,A,he frightened me so with his cruel faces
p00069_A,00069,A,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00070_A,00070,A,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week
p00071_A,00071,A,now girl take this gentleman and me to your father s we are going there what have you got in that bottle you are carrying
p00072_A,00072,A,gin
p00073_A,00073,A,dear no sir it s the nine oils
p00074_A,00074,A,the what
p00075_A,00075,A,the nine oils sir to rub father with
p00076_A,00076,A,then what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for
p00077_A,00077,A,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00078_A,00078,A,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00079_A,00079,A,and this is pod s end is it jupe
p00080_A,00080,A,this is it sir and if you wouldn t mind sir this is the house it s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it s only merrylegs and he only barks
p00081_A,00081,A,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00082_A,00082,A,father is not in our room sir if you wouldn t mind walking in i ll find him directly father must have gone down to the booth sir i don t know why he should go there but he must be there i ll bring him in a minute
p00083_A,00083,A,by your leaves gentlemen
p00084_A,00084,A,by your leaves gentlemen it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe
p00085_A,00085,A,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00086_A,00086,A,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00087_A,00087,A,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00088_A,00088,A,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00089_A,00089,A,kidderminster stow that
p00090_A,00090,A,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00091_A,00091,A,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00092_A,00092,A,has what has he missed
p00093_A,00093,A,missed his tip
p00094_A,00094,A,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00095_A,00095,A,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00096_A,00096,A,oh that is tip is it
p00097_A,00097,A,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00098_A,00098,A,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00099_A,00099,A,lower yourself then oh lord if you ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to let yourself down a bit
p00100_A,00100,A,this is a very obtrusive lad
p00101_A,00101,A,we d have had a young gentleman to meet you if we had known you were coming it s a pity you don t have a bespeak being so particular you re on the tight jeff ain t you
p00102_A,00102,A,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00103_A,00103,A,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00104_A,00104,A,yes i was
p00105_A,00105,A,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00106_A,00106,A,i never saw the man in my life
p00107_A,00107,A,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00108_A,00108,A,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00109_A,00109,A,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00110_A,00110,A,why has he been so very much goosed
p00111_A,00111,A,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00112_A,00112,A,a cackler here we go again
p00113_A,00113,A,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00114_A,00114,A,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00115_A,00115,A,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now
p00116_A,00116,A,perhaps so
p00117_A,00117,A,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00118_A,00118,A,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00119_A,00119,A,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00120_A,00120,A,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00121_A,00121,A,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00122_A,00122,A,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00123_A,00123,A,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00124_A,00124,A,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00125_A,00125,A,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00126_A,00126,A,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00127_A,00127,A,thquire your thervant thith ith a bad piethe of bithnith thith ith you ve heard of my clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed
p00128_A,00128,A,yes
p00129_A,00129,A,well thquire ith it your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl thquire
p00130_A,00130,A,i shall have something to propose to her when she comes back
p00131_A,00131,A,glad to hear it thquire not that i want to get rid of the child any more than i want to thtand in her way i m willing to take her prentith though at her age ith late my voithe ith a little huthky thquire and not eathy heard by them ath don t know me but if you d been chilled and heated heated and chilled chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young ath often ath i have been your voithe wouldn t have lathted out thquire no more than mine
p00132_A,00132,A,i dare say not
p00133_A,00133,A,what thall it be thquire while you wait thall it be therry give it a name thquire
p00134_A,00134,A,nothing for me i thank you
p00135_A,00135,A,father hush she has come back
p00136_A,00136,A,ith an internal thame upon my thoul it ith
p00137_A,00137,A,o my dear father my good kind father where are you gone you are gone to try to do me some good i know you are gone away for my sake i am sure and how miserable and helpless you will be without me poor poor father until you come back
p00138_A,00138,A,now good people all this is wanton waste of time let the girl understand the fact let her take it from me if you like who have been run away from myself here what s your name your father has absconded deserted you and you mustn t expect to see him again as long as you live
p00139_A,00139,A,i tell you what thquire to thpeak plain to you my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort and drop it they re a very good natur d people my people but they re accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh and if you don t act upon my advithe i m damned if i don t believe they ll pith you out o winder
p00140_A,00140,A,it is of no moment whether this person is to be expected back at any time or the contrary he is gone away and there is no present expectation of his return that i believe is agreed on all hands
p00141_A,00141,A,thath agreed thquire thick to that
p00142_A,00142,A,well then i who came here to inform the father of the poor girl jupe that she could not be received at the school any more in consequence of there being practical objections into which i need not enter to the reception there of the children of persons so employed am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal i am willing to take charge of you jupe and to educate you and provide for you the only condition over and above your good behaviour i make is that you decide now at once whether to accompany me or remain here also that if you accompany me now it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present these observations comprise the whole of the case
p00143_A,00143,A,at the thame time i mutht put in my word thquire tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen if you like thethilia to be prentitht you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth emma gordon in whothe lap you re a lying at prethent would be a mother to you and joth phine would be a thithter to you i don t pretend to be of the angel breed myself and i don t thay but what when you mith d your tip you d find me cut up rough and thwear an oath or two at you but what i thay thquire ith that good tempered or bad tempered i never did a horthe a injury yet no more than thwearing at him went and that i don t expect i thall begin otherwithe at my time of life with a rider i never wath much of a cackler thquire and i have thed my thay
p00144_A,00144,A,the only observation i will make to you jupe in the way of influencing your decision is that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education and that even your father himself from what i understand appears on your behalf to have known and felt that much be sure you know your own mind jupe i say no more be sure you know your own mind
p00145_A,00145,A,when father comes back how will he ever find me if i go away
p00146_A,00146,A,you may be quite at ease you may be quite at ease jupe on that score in such a case your father i apprehend must find out mr
p00147_A,00147,A,thleary thath my name thquire not athamed of it known all over england and alwayth paythe ith way
p00148_A,00148,A,must find out mr sleary who would then let him know where you went i should have no power of keeping you against his wish and he would have no difficulty at any time in finding mr thomas gradgrind of coketown i am well known
p00149_A,00149,A,well known you re one of the thort thquire that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe but never mind that at prethent
p00150_A,00150,A,oh give me my clothes give me my clothes and let me go away before i break my heart
p00151_A,00151,A,now jupe if you are quite determined come
p00152_A,00152,A,leave the bottle my dear ith large to carry it will be of no uthe to you now give it to me
p00153_A,00153,A,no no oh no pray let me keep it for father till he comes back he will want it when he comes back he had never thought of going away when he sent me for it i must keep it for him if you please
p00154_A,00154,A,mr bounderby you are unusually slow sir with your breakfast this morning
p00155_A,00155,A,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl
p00156_A,00156,A,the girl is now waiting to know whether she is to go straight to the school or up to the lodge
p00157_A,00157,A,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00158_A,00158,A,of course she can if you wish it mr bounderby
p00159_A,00159,A,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00160_A,00160,A,indeed mr bounderby very thoughtful of you
p00161_A,00161,A,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00162_A,00162,A,are you speaking of young miss gradgrind mr bounderby
p00163_A,00163,A,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00164_A,00164,A,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00165_A,00165,A,louisa louisa louisa
p00166_A,00166,A,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00167_A,00167,A,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00168_A,00168,A,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00169_A,00169,A,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00170_A,00170,A,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00171_A,00171,A,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00172_A,00172,A,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00173_A,00173,A,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00174_A,00174,A,i do not sir deny it
p00175_A,00175,A,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00176_A,00176,A,it is true sir
p00177_A,00177,A,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00178_A,00178,A,can jupe be sent here bounderby
p00179_A,00179,A,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00180_A,00180,A,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00181_A,00181,A,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00182_A,00182,A,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00183_A,00183,A,jupe i have made up my mind to take you into my house and when you are not in attendance at the school to employ you about mrs gradgrind who is rather an invalid i have explained to miss louisa this is miss louisa the miserable but natural end of your late career and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past and is not to be referred to any more from this time you begin your history you are at present ignorant i know
p00184_A,00184,A,yes sir very
p00185_A,00185,A,i shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you of the advantages of the training you will receive you will be reclaimed and formed you have been in the habit now of reading to your father and those people i found you among i dare say
p00186_A,00186,A,only to father and merrylegs sir at least i mean to father when merrylegs was always there
p00187_A,00187,A,never mind merrylegs jupe i don t ask about him i understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father
p00188_A,00188,A,o yes sir thousands of times they were the happiest o of all the happy times we had together sir
p00189_A,00189,A,and what did you read to your father jupe
p00190_A,00190,A,about the fairies sir and the dwarf and the hunchback and the genies and about
p00191_A,00191,A,hush that is enough never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more bounderby this is a case for rigid training and i shall observe it with interest
p00192_A,00192,A,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00193_A,00193,A,louisa never wonder
p00194_A,00194,A,i am sick of my life loo i hate it altogether and i hate everybody except you
p00195_A,00195,A,you don t hate sissy tom
p00196_A,00196,A,i hate to be obliged to call her jupe and she hates me
p00197_A,00197,A,no she does not tom i am sure
p00198_A,00198,A,she must she must just hate and detest the whole set out of us they ll bother her head off i think before they have done with her already she s getting as pale as wax and as heavy as i am as to me i am a donkey that s what i am i am as obstinate as one i am more stupid than one i get as much pleasure as one and i should like to kick like one
p00199_A,00199,A,not me i hope tom
p00200_A,00200,A,no loo i wouldn t hurt you i made an exception of you at first i don t know what this jolly old jaundiced jail would be without you
p00201_A,00201,A,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00202_A,00202,A,why of course i do what s the use of talking about it
p00203_A,00203,A,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00204_A,00204,A,well no more do i i am as bad as you in that respect and i am a mule too which you re not if father was determined to make me either a prig or a mule and i am not a prig why it stands to reason i must be a mule and so i am
p00205_A,00205,A,it s a great pity it s a great pity tom it s very unfortunate for both of us
p00206_A,00206,A,oh you you are a girl loo and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does i don t miss anything in you you are the only pleasure i have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like
p00207_A,00207,A,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it
p00208_A,00208,A,i wish i could collect all the facts we hear so much about and all the figures and all the people who found them out and i wish i could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together however when i go to live with old bounderby i ll have my revenge
p00209_A,00209,A,your revenge tom
p00210_A,00210,A,i mean i ll enjoy myself a little and go about and see something and hear something i ll recompense myself for the way in which i have been brought up
p00211_A,00211,A,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00212_A,00212,A,oh i don t mind that i shall very well know how to manage and smooth old bounderby
p00213_A,00213,A,what is your great mode of smoothing and managing tom is it a secret
p00214_A,00214,A,oh if it is a secret it s not far off it s you you are his little pet you are his favourite he ll do anything for you when he says to me what i don t like i shall say to him that ll bring him about or nothing will have you gone to sleep loo
p00215_A,00215,A,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00216_A,00216,A,you seem to find more to look at in it than ever i could find another of the advantages i suppose of being a girl
p00217_A,00217,A,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00218_A,00218,A,why there s one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home
p00219_A,00219,A,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00220_A,00220,A,not but what i shall be very unwilling both to leave you loo and to leave you here but i must go you know whether i like it or not and i had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence than where i should lose it altogether don t you see
p00221_A,00221,A,yes tom
p00222_A,00222,A,except that it is a fire it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks what do you see in it not a circus
p00223_A,00223,A,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00224_A,00224,A,wondering again
p00225_A,00225,A,then i beg of you louisa to do nothing of that description for goodness sake you inconsiderate girl or i shall never hear the last of it from your father and thomas it is really shameful with my poor head continually wearing me out that a boy brought up as you have been and whose education has cost what yours has should be found encouraging his sister to wonder when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it louisa don t tell me in my state of health for unless you had been encouraged it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it
p00226_A,00226,A,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00227_A,00227,A,what is the first principle of this science
p00228_A,00228,A,it would be a fine thing to be you miss louisa
p00229_A,00229,A,do you think so
p00230_A,00230,A,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00231_A,00231,A,you might not be the better for it sissy
p00232_A,00232,A,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00233_A,00233,A,i don t know that you are more useful to my mother and more pleasant with her than i can ever be you are pleasanter to yourself than i am to my self
p00234_A,00234,A,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00235_A,00235,A,mr and mrs m choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves i suppose sissy
p00236_A,00236,A,o no they know everything
p00237_A,00237,A,tell me some of your mistakes
p00238_A,00238,A,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00239_A,00239,A,national i think it must have been
p00240_A,00240,A,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00241_A,00241,A,you had better say national as he said so
p00242_A,00242,A,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00243_A,00243,A,what did you say
p00244_A,00244,A,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00245_A,00245,A,that was a great mistake of yours
p00246_A,00246,A,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00247_A,00247,A,of course it was
p00248_A,00248,A,then mr m choakumchild said he would try me once more and he said here are the stutterings
p00249_A,00249,A,statistics
p00250_A,00250,A,yes miss louisa they always remind me of stutterings and that s another of my mistakes of accidents upon the sea and i find mr m choakumchild said that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death what is the percentage and i said miss i said it was nothing
p00251_A,00251,A,nothing sissy
p00252_A,00252,A,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00253_A,00253,A,did your father know so much himself that he wished you to be well taught too sissy no one hears us and if any one did i am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question
p00254_A,00254,A,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00255_A,00255,A,your mother
p00256_A,00256,A,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00257_A,00257,A,did your father love her
p00258_A,00258,A,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00259_A,00259,A,yet he leaves you now sissy
p00260_A,00260,A,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00261_A,00261,A,tell me more about him i will never ask you again where did you live
p00262_A,00262,A,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00263_A,00263,A,to make the people laugh
p00264_A,00264,A,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00265_A,00265,A,and you were his comfort through everything
p00266_A,00266,A,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00267_A,00267,A,and he liked them
p00268_A,00268,A,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00269_A,00269,A,and your father was always kind to the last
p00270_A,00270,A,always always kinder and kinder than i can tell he was angry only one night and that was not to me but merrylegs merrylegs is his performing dog
p00271_A,00271,A,why was he angry with the dog
p00272_A,00272,A,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00273_A,00273,A,finish by telling me how your father left you sissy now that i have asked you so much tell me the end the blame if there is any blame is mine not yours
p00274_A,00274,A,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and
p00275_A,00275,A,i am asking sissy a few questions tom you have no occasion to go away but don t interrupt us for a moment tom dear
p00276_A,00276,A,oh very well only father has brought old bounderby home and i want you to come into the drawing room because if you come there s a good chance of old bounderby s asking me to dinner and if you don t there s none
p00277_A,00277,A,i ll come directly
p00278_A,00278,A,i ll wait for you to make sure
p00279_A,00279,A,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone
p00280_A,00280,A,i say look sharp for old bounderby loo
p00281_A,00281,A,there s no more to tell miss louisa i keep the nine oils ready for him and i know he will come back every letter that i see in mr gradgrind s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes for i think it comes from father or from mr sleary about father mr sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of and i trust to him to keep his word
p00282_A,00282,A,do look sharp for old bounderby loo he ll be off if you don t look sharp
p00283_A,00283,A,i beg your pardon sir for being troublesome but have you had any letter yet about me

p00330_A,00330,A,if i was to live wi her an not marry her saying such a thing could be which it never could or would an her so good there s a law to punish me in every innocent child belonging to me
p00331_A,00331,A,of course there is
p00332_A,00332,A,now a god s name show me the law to help me
p00333_A,00333,A,hem there s a sanctity in this relation of life and and it must be kept up
p00334_A,00334,A,no no dunnot say that sir tan t kep up that way not that way tis kep down that way i m a weaver i were in a fact ry when a chilt but i ha gotten een to see wi and eern to year wi i read in th papers every sizes every sessions and you read too i know it with dismay how th supposed unpossibility o ever getting unchained from one another at any price on any terms brings blood upon this land and brings many common married fok to battle murder and sudden death let us ha this right understood mine s a grievous case an i want if yo will be so good t know the law that helps me
p00335_A,00335,A,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money
p00336_A,00336,A,how much might that be
p00337_A,00337,A,why you d have to go to doctors commons with a suit and you d have to go to a court of common law with a suit and you d have to go to the house of lords with a suit and you d have to get an act of parliament to enable you to marry again and it would cost you if it was a case of very plain sailing i suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound perhaps twice the money
p00338_A,00338,A,there s no other law
p00339_A,00339,A,certainly not

p00366_A,00366,A,i am as i have told thee stephen thy poor friend angels are not like me between them and a working woman fu of faults there is a deep gulf set my little sister is among them but she is changed
p00367_A,00367,A,i fear jupe that your continuance at the school any longer would be useless
p00368_A,00368,A,i am afraid it would sir
p00369_A,00369,A,i cannot disguise from you jupe that the result of your probation there has disappointed me has greatly disappointed me you have not acquired under mr and mrs m choakumchild anything like that amount of exact knowledge which i looked for you are extremely deficient in your facts your acquaintance with figures is very limited you are altogether backward and below the mark
p00370_A,00370,A,i am sorry sir but i know it is quite true yet i have tried hard sir
p00371_A,00371,A,yes yes i believe you have tried hard i have observed you and i can find no fault in that respect
p00372_A,00372,A,thank you sir i have thought sometimes that perhaps i tried to learn too much and that if i had asked to be allowed to try a little less i might have
p00373_A,00373,A,no jupe no no the course you pursued you pursued according to the system the system and there is no more to be said about it i can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers and that we began too late still as i have said already i am disappointed
p00374_A,00374,A,i wish i could have made a better acknowledgment sir of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you and of your protection of her
p00375_A,00375,A,don t shed tears don t shed tears i don t complain of you you are an affectionate earnest good young woman and and we must make that do
p00376_A,00376,A,thank you sir very much
p00377_A,00377,A,you are useful to mrs gradgrind and in a generally pervading way you are serviceable in the family also so i understand from miss louisa and indeed so i have observed myself i therefore hope that you can make yourself happy in those relations
p00378_A,00378,A,i should have nothing to wish sir if
p00379_A,00379,A,my dear louisa you are a woman
p00380_A,00380,A,yes father
p00381_A,00381,A,my dear i must speak with you alone and seriously come to me in my room after breakfast to morrow will you
p00382_A,00382,A,yes father
p00383_A,00383,A,your hands are rather cold louisa are you not well
p00384_A,00384,A,quite well father
p00385_A,00385,A,and cheerful
p00386_A,00386,A,i am as cheerful father as i usually am or usually have been
p00387_A,00387,A,are you there loo
p00388_A,00388,A,dear tom how long it is since you have been to see me
p00389_A,00389,A,why i have been otherwise engaged loo in the evenings and in the daytime old bounderby has been keeping me at it rather but i touch him up with you when he comes it too strong and so we preserve an understanding i say has father said anything particular to you to day or yesterday loo
p00390_A,00390,A,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00391_A,00391,A,ah that s what i mean do you know where he is to night
p00392_A,00392,A,no
p00393_A,00393,A,then i ll tell you he s with old bounderby they are having a regular confab together up at the bank why at the bank do you think well i ll tell you again to keep mrs sparsit s ears as far off as possible i expect you are very fond of me an t you loo
p00394_A,00394,A,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00395_A,00395,A,well sister of mine when you say that you are near my thoughts we might be so much oftener together mightn t we always together almost mightn t we it would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to i know what loo it would be a splendid thing for me it would be uncommonly jolly i say loo i thought i d come and just hint to you what was going on though i supposed you d most likely guess even if you didn t know i can t stay because i m engaged to some fellows to night you won t forget how fond you are of me
p00396_A,00396,A,no dear tom i won t forget
p00397_A,00397,A,my dear louisa i prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together you have been so well trained and you do i am happy to say so much justice to the education you have received that i have perfect confidence in your good sense you are not impulsive you are not romantic you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation from that ground alone i know you will view and consider what i am going to communicate louisa my dear you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me a proposal of marriage my dear
p00398_A,00398,A,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00399_A,00399,A,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00400_A,00400,A,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00401_A,00401,A,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00402_A,00402,A,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00403_A,00403,A,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00404_A,00404,A,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00405_A,00405,A,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00406_A,00406,A,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00407_A,00407,A,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00408_A,00408,A,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00409_A,00409,A,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00410_A,00410,A,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00411_A,00411,A,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00412_A,00412,A,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00413_A,00413,A,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00414_A,00414,A,shall i marry him
p00415_A,00415,A,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00416_A,00416,A,no father i do not
p00417_A,00417,A,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00418_A,00418,A,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00419_A,00419,A,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00420_A,00420,A,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00421_A,00421,A,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00422_A,00422,A,i speak of my own life father
p00423_A,00423,A,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00424_A,00424,A,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00425_A,00425,A,how matter what matter my dear
p00426_A,00426,A,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00427_A,00427,A,certainly my dear
p00428_A,00428,A,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00429_A,00429,A,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00430_A,00430,A,none father what does it matter
p00431_A,00431,A,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00432_A,00432,A,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00433_A,00433,A,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00434_A,00434,A,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00435_A,00435,A,my dear quite true quite true
p00436_A,00436,A,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00437_A,00437,A,mrs gradgrind allow me to present to you mrs bounderby
p00438_A,00438,A,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him
p00439_A,00439,A,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00440_A,00440,A,good evening mr bounderby
p00441_A,00441,A,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00442_A,00442,A,thank you sir
p00443_A,00443,A,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00444_A,00444,A,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00445_A,00445,A,mrs sparsit ma am i am going to astonish you
p00446_A,00446,A,yes sir
p00447_A,00447,A,i am going ma am to marry tom gradgrind s daughter
p00448_A,00448,A,yes sir i hope you may be happy mr bounderby oh indeed i hope you may be happy sir
p00449_A,00449,A,i wish with all my heart sir that you may be in all respects very happy
p00450_A,00450,A,well ma am i am obliged to you i hope i shall be
p00451_A,00451,A,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00452_A,00452,A,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00453_A,00453,A,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00454_A,00454,A,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00455_A,00455,A,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00456_A,00456,A,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00457_A,00457,A,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00458_A,00458,A,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00459_A,00459,A,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00460_A,00460,A,you ll have your own private apartments and you ll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it and you ll have your maid to attend upon you and you ll have your light porter to protect you and you ll be what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable
p00461_A,00461,A,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00462_A,00462,A,ladies and gentlemen i am josiah bounderby of coketown since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness i suppose i must acknowledge the same though as you all know me and know what i am and what my extraction was you won t expect a speech from a man who when he sees a post says and when he sees a pump says and is not to be got to call a post a pump or a pump a post or either of them a toothpick if you want a speech this morning my friend and father in law tom gradgrind is a member of parliament and you know where to get it i am not your man however if i feel a little independent when i look around this table to day and reflect how little i thought of marrying tom gradgrind s daughter when i was a ragged street boy who never washed his face unless it was at a pump and that not oftener than once a fortnight i hope i may be excused so i hope you like my feeling independent if you don t i can t help it i do feel independent now i have mentioned and you have mentioned that i am this day married to tom gradgrind s daughter i am very glad to be so it has long been my wish to be so i have watched her bringing up and i believe she is worthy of me at the same time not to deceive you i believe i am worthy of her so i thank you on both our parts for the good will you have shown towards us and the best wish i can give the unmarried part of the present company is this i hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as i have found and i hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found
p00463_A,00463,A,thank you bitzer

p00468_A,00468,A,well ma am i can t say that i have heard anything particular our people are a bad lot ma am but that is no news unfortunately
p00469_A,00469,A,what are the restless wretches doing now
p00470_A,00470,A,merely going on in the old way ma am uniting and leaguing and engaging to stand by one another
p00471_A,00471,A,it is much to be regretted that the united masters allow of any such class combinations
p00472_A,00472,A,yes ma am
p00473_A,00473,A,being united themselves they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man
p00474_A,00474,A,they have done that ma am but it rather fell through ma am
p00475_A,00475,A,i do not pretend to understand these things my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere and mr sparsit as a powler being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions i only know that these people must be conquered and that it s high time it was done once for all
p00476_A,00476,A,yes ma am you couldn t put it clearer i am sure ma am
p00477_A,00477,A,has it been a busy day bitzer
p00478_A,00478,A,not a very busy day my lady about an average day
p00479_A,00479,A,the clerks are trustworthy punctual and industrious of course

p00483_A,00483,A,bitzer do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names
p00484_A,00484,A,i beg your pardon ma am it s quite true that you did object to names being used and they re always best avoided
p00485_A,00485,A,please to remember that i have a charge here i hold a trust here bitzer under mr bounderby however improbable both mr bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago that he would ever become my patron making me an annual compliment i cannot but regard him in that light from mr bounderby i have received every acknowledgment of my social station and every recognition of my family descent that i could possibly expect more far more therefore to my patron i will be scrupulously true and i do not consider i will not consider i cannot consider that i should be scrupulously true if i allowed names to be mentioned under this roof that are unfortunately most unfortunately no doubt of that connected with his no bitzer say an individual and i will hear you say mr thomas and you must excuse me
p00486_A,00486,A,with the usual exception ma am of an individual
p00487_A,00487,A,ah h
p00488_A,00488,A,an individual ma am has never been what he ought to have been since he first came into the place he is a dissipated extravagant idler he is not worth his salt ma am he wouldn t get it either if he hadn t a friend and relation at court ma am

p00517_A,00517,A,a powler
p00518_A,00518,A,powler family you must be very much bored here
p00519_A,00519,A,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00520_A,00520,A,very philosophical and very exemplary and laudable and
p00521_A,00521,A,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00522_A,00522,A,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00523_A,00523,A,no sir he does not
p00524_A,00524,A,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00525_A,00525,A,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00526_A,00526,A,quite an eternity i think he married gradgrind s daughter
p00527_A,00527,A,yes he had that honour
p00528_A,00528,A,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00529_A,00529,A,indeed sir is she
p00530_A,00530,A,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00531_A,00531,A,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00532_A,00532,A,i give you my honour mrs powler that i never was so astonished in my life i assure you mrs powler that the father s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity i am obliged to you of all things for correcting so absurd a mistake pray excuse my intrusion many thanks good day
p00533_A,00533,A,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00534_A,00534,A,spends a deal of money on his dress ma am
p00535_A,00535,A,it must be admitted that it s very tasteful
p00536_A,00536,A,yes ma am if that s worth the money besides which ma am he looks to me as if he gamed
p00537_A,00537,A,it s immoral to game
p00538_A,00538,A,it s ridiculous ma am because the chances are against the players
p00539_A,00539,A,if you want to bring in for any place a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech look after my brother jem for he s your man
p00540_A,00540,A,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00541_A,00541,A,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00542_A,00542,A,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00543_A,00543,A,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00544_A,00544,A,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00545_A,00545,A,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00546_A,00546,A,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00547_A,00547,A,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00548_A,00548,A,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00549_A,00549,A,you are going to devote yourself as i gather from what mr bounderby has said to the service of your country you have made up your mind to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties
p00550_A,00550,A,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00551_A,00551,A,have you none of your own
p00552_A,00552,A,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00553_A,00553,A,you are a singular politician
p00554_A,00554,A,when i was your age young tom i was punctual or i got no dinner
p00555_A,00555,A,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards
p00556_A,00556,A,never mind that now
p00557_A,00557,A,well then don t begin with me
p00558_A,00558,A,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p00559_A,00559,A,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00560_A,00560,A,no such luck sir
p00561_A,00561,A,do you smoke
p00562_A,00562,A,thank ee thank ee well mr harthouse i hope you have had about a dose of old bounderby to night
p00563_A,00563,A,a very good fellow indeed
p00564_A,00564,A,you think so don t you
p00565_A,00565,A,what a comical brother in law you are
p00566_A,00566,A,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean
p00567_A,00567,A,you are a piece of caustic tom
p00568_A,00568,A,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p00569_A,00569,A,don t mind me but take care when his wife is by you know
p00570_A,00570,A,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p00571_A,00571,A,that s the past tense tom we are in the present tense now
p00572_A,00572,A,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p00573_A,00573,A,good very quaint though you don t mean it
p00574_A,00574,A,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p00575_A,00575,A,my dear fellow what am i bound to suppose when i find two married people living in harmony and happiness
p00576_A,00576,A,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p00577_A,00577,A,very dutiful in your interesting sister
p00578_A,00578,A,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p00579_A,00579,A,it was charming tom
p00580_A,00580,A,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p00581_A,00581,A,perfectly delightful and she gets on so placidly
p00582_A,00582,A,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p00583_A,00583,A,ay ay has resources of her own
p00584_A,00584,A,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p00585_A,00585,A,formed his daughter on his own model
p00586_A,00586,A,his daughter ah and everybody else why he formed me that way
p00587_A,00587,A,impossible
p00588_A,00588,A,he did though i mean to say mr harthouse that when i first left home and went to old bounderby s i was as flat as a warming pan and knew no more about life than any oyster does
p00589_A,00589,A,come tom i can hardly believe that a joke s a joke
p00590_A,00590,A,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p00591_A,00591,A,and your intelligent sister
p00592_A,00592,A,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p00593_A,00593,A,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister
p00594_A,00594,A,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no

p00616_A,00616,A,wi yor pardon sir i ha nowt to sen about it
p00617_A,00617,A,now look here harthouse here s a specimen of em when this man was here once before i warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about and who ought to be hanged wherever they are found and i told this man that he was going in the wrong direction now would you believe it that although they have put this mark upon him he is such a slave to them still that he s afraid to open his lips about them
p00618_A,00618,A,i sed as i had nowt to sen sir not as i was fearfo o openin my lips
p00619_A,00619,A,you said ah i know what you said more than that i know what you mean you see not always the same thing by the lord harry quite different things you had better tell us at once that that fellow slackbridge is not in the town stirring up the people to mutiny and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people that is a most confounded scoundrel you had better tell us so at once you can t deceive me you want to tell us so why don t you
p00620_A,00620,A,i m as sooary as yo sir when the people s leaders is bad they taks such as offers haply tis na the sma est o their misfortuns when they can get no better
p00621_A,00621,A,now you ll think this pretty well harthouse you ll think this tolerably strong you ll say upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with but this is nothing sir you shall hear me ask this man a question pray mr blackpool may i take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this combination
p00622_A,00622,A,how t happens

p00624_A,00624,A,i d leefer not coom to t sir but sin you put th question an not want n t be ill manner n i ll answer i ha passed a promess

p00627_A,00627,A,as for me any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it if only josiah bounderby of coketown had been in question you would have joined and made no bones about it
p00628_A,00628,A,why yes sir tis true
p00629_A,00629,A,though he knows that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for now mr harthouse you have been knocking about in the world some time did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country

p00676_A,00676,A,what shall i understand that you mean by a bad name
p00677_A,00677,A,the name of being troublesome
p00678_A,00678,A,then by the prejudices of his own class and by the prejudices of the other he is sacrificed alike are the two so deeply separated in this town that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them he fell into suspicion with his fellow weavers because he had made a promise not to be one of them i think it must have been to you that he made that promise might i ask you why he made it

p00705_A,00705,A,why sir i am told that nickits gave seven hundred pound for that seabeach now to be plain with you if i ever in the whole course of my life take seven looks at it at a hundred pound a look it will be as much as i shall do no by george i don t forget that i am josiah bounderby of coketown for years upon years the only pictures in my possession or that i could have got into my possession by any means unless i stole em were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot on the blacking bottles that i was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with and that i sold when they were empty for a farthing a piece and glad to get it
p00706_A,00706,A,harthouse you have a couple of horses down here bring half a dozen more if you like and we ll find room for em there s stabling in this place for a dozen horses and unless nickits is belied he kept the full number a round dozen of em sir when that man was a boy he went to westminster school went to westminster school as a king s scholar when i was principally living on garbage and sleeping in market baskets why if i wanted to keep a dozen horses which i don t for one s enough for me i couldn t bear to see em in their stalls here and think what my own lodging used to be i couldn t look at em sir and not order em out yet so things come round you see this place you know what sort of a place it is you are aware that there s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere i don t care where and here got into the middle of it like a maggot into a nut is josiah bounderby while nickits as a man came into my office and told me yesterday nickits who used to act in latin in the westminster school plays with the chief justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face is drivelling at this minute drivelling sir in a fifth floor up a narrow dark back street in antwerp
p00707_A,00707,A,pardon me the expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful tom should be so proud of it i know this is inexcusable but i am so compelled to admire
p00708_A,00708,A,being so impulsive
p00709_A,00709,A,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00710_A,00710,A,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00711_A,00711,A,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00712_A,00712,A,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00713_A,00713,A,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00714_A,00714,A,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00715_A,00715,A,thank you i claim to deserve it you know how little i do claim but i will go that length you have done so much for him you are so fond of him your whole life mrs bounderby expresses such charming self forgetfulness on his account pardon me again i am running wide of the subject i am interested in him for his own sake mrs bounderby it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother s years if he is heedless inconsiderate and expensive a little dissipated in the common phrase is he
p00716_A,00716,A,yes
p00717_A,00717,A,allow me to be frank do you think he games at all i think he makes bets
p00718_A,00718,A,i know he does
p00719_A,00719,A,of course he loses
p00720_A,00720,A,yes
p00721_A,00721,A,everybody does lose who bets may i hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes acquit me of impertinent curiosity my dear mrs bounderby i think tom may be gradually falling into trouble and i wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience shall i say again for his sake is that necessary candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father
p00722_A,00722,A,i do not think it likely
p00723_A,00723,A,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00724_A,00724,A,i do not think that likely either
p00725_A,00725,A,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00726_A,00726,A,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00727_A,00727,A,when i married i found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt heavily for him i mean heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets they were no sacrifice i sold them very willingly i attached no value to them they were quite worthless to me since then i have given my brother at various times what money i could spare in short what money i have had confiding in you at all on the faith of the interest you profess for him i will not do so by halves since you have been in the habit of visiting here he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds i have not been able to give it to him i have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved but i have kept these secrets until now when i trust them to your honour i have held no confidence with any one because you anticipated my reason just now
p00728_A,00728,A,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00729_A,00729,A,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00730_A,00730,A,halloa i didn t know you were here
p00731_A,00731,A,whose name tom have you been carving on the trees
p00732_A,00732,A,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p00733_A,00733,A,you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature s on the bark tom
p00734_A,00734,A,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p00735_A,00735,A,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00736_A,00736,A,mercenary who is not mercenary ask my sister
p00737_A,00737,A,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00738_A,00738,A,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it
p00739_A,00739,A,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00740_A,00740,A,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p00741_A,00741,A,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p00742_A,00742,A,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p00743_A,00743,A,my good fellow so am i
p00744_A,00744,A,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p00745_A,00745,A,tom you are inconsiderate you expect too much of your sister you have had money of her you dog you know you have
p00746_A,00746,A,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p00747_A,00747,A,but my dear tom if your sister has not got it
p00748_A,00748,A,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p00749_A,00749,A,my dear tom let me try to be your banker
p00750_A,00750,A,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p00751_A,00751,A,what is the present need tom three figures out with them say what they are
p00752_A,00752,A,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p00753_A,00753,A,and i take your offer as a great kindness as a great kindness mr harthouse
p00754_A,00754,A,well it may be of more use by and by and my good fellow if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you i may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself
p00755_A,00755,A,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p00756_A,00756,A,now you see tom every man is selfish in everything he does and i am exactly like the rest of my fellow creatures i am desperately intent on your softening towards your sister which you ought to do and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother which you ought to be
p00757_A,00757,A,i will be mr harthouse
p00758_A,00758,A,no time like the present tom begin at once
p00759_A,00759,A,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p00760_A,00760,A,having made which bargain tom we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner time
p00761_A,00761,A,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p00762_A,00762,A,harthouse have you heard

p00769_A,00769,A,of much
p00770_A,00770,A,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00771_A,00771,A,of how much
p00772_A,00772,A,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00773_A,00773,A,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00774_A,00774,A,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00775_A,00775,A,i suppose it might
p00776_A,00776,A,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit

p00780_A,00780,A,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00781_A,00781,A,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00782_A,00782,A,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00783_A,00783,A,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00784_A,00784,A,where is tom by the by
p00785_A,00785,A,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00786_A,00786,A,is anybody suspected
p00787_A,00787,A,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00788_A,00788,A,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00789_A,00789,A,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00790_A,00790,A,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00791_A,00791,A,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00792_A,00792,A,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00793_A,00793,A,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00794_A,00794,A,suspicious certainly
p00795_A,00795,A,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00796_A,00796,A,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00797_A,00797,A,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00798_A,00798,A,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00799_A,00799,A,don t be low sir pray let me see you cheerful sir as i used to do i cannot bear to see you so sir try a hand at backgammon sir as you used to do when i had the honour of living under your roof

p00828_A,00828,A,tom do you believe the man i gave the money to is really implicated in this crime
p00829_A,00829,A,i don t know i don t see why he shouldn t be
p00830_A,00830,A,he seemed to me an honest man
p00831_A,00831,A,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is
p00832_A,00832,A,was he offended by what you said
p00833_A,00833,A,no he took it pretty well he was civil enough where are you loo good night my dear good night

p00836_A,00836,A,i wouldn t have you do that to night tom of all the nights in your life many and much happier as i hope they will be
p00837_A,00837,A,it appears but yesterday sir that i had the honour of receiving you at the bank when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with mr bounderby s address
p00838_A,00838,A,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00839_A,00839,A,we live in a singular world sir
p00840_A,00840,A,i have had the honour by a coincidence of which i am proud to have made a remark similar in effect though not so epigrammatically expressed
p00841_A,00841,A,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00842_A,00842,A,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00843_A,00843,A,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00844_A,00844,A,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00845_A,00845,A,very engaging sir
p00846_A,00846,A,highly so
p00847_A,00847,A,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00848_A,00848,A,there stop where you are ma am stop where you are mrs bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble i believe
p00849_A,00849,A,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00850_A,00850,A,you may set your mind at rest ma am you can take it very quietly can t you loo
p00851_A,00851,A,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00852_A,00852,A,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time
p00853_A,00853,A,what is the matter with you what has given you offence
p00854_A,00854,A,offence do you suppose if there was any offence given me i shouldn t name it and request to have it corrected i am a straightforward man i believe i don t go beating about for side winds
p00855_A,00855,A,i suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident or too delicate i have never made that objection to you either as a child or as a woman i don t understand what you would have
p00856_A,00856,A,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00857_A,00857,A,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00858_A,00858,A,well my dear and i hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself it was all your father s doing he set his heart upon it and he ought to know
p00859_A,00859,A,i want to hear of you mother not of myself
p00860_A,00860,A,you want to hear of me my dear that s something new i am sure when anybody wants to hear of me not at all well louisa very faint and giddy
p00861_A,00861,A,are you in pain dear mother
p00862_A,00862,A,i think there s a pain somewhere in the room but i couldn t positively say that i have got it you very seldom see your sister she grows like you i wish you would look at her sissy bring her here do you see the likeness louisa
p00863_A,00863,A,yes mother i should think her like me but
p00864_A,00864,A,eh yes i always say so and that reminds me i i want to speak to you my dear sissy my good girl leave us alone a minute
p00865_A,00865,A,you were going to speak to me mother
p00866_A,00866,A,eh yes to be sure my dear you know your father is almost always away now and therefore i must write to him about it
p00867_A,00867,A,about what mother don t be troubled about what
p00868_A,00868,A,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything
p00869_A,00869,A,i can hear you mother
p00870_A,00870,A,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00871_A,00871,A,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00872_A,00872,A,i tell you what ma am you shall come down here of a saturday while the fine weather lasts and stay till monday
p00873_A,00873,A,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00874_A,00874,A,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am
p00875_A,00875,A,very true sir
p00876_A,00876,A,nor yet in a week ma am
p00877_A,00877,A,no indeed sir
p00878_A,00878,A,in a similar manner ma am i can wait you know if romulus and remus could wait josiah bounderby can wait they were better off in their youth than i was however they had a she wolf for a nurse i had only a she wolf for a grandmother she didn t give any milk ma am she gave bruises she was a regular alderney at that
p00879_A,00879,A,ah
p00880_A,00880,A,no ma am i have not heard anything more about it it s in hand though and young tom who rather sticks to business at present something new for him he hadn t the schooling i had is helping my injunction is keep it quiet and let it seem to blow over do what you like under the rose but don t give a sign of what you re about or half a hundred of em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted out of reach for good keep it quiet and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little and we shall have em
p00881_A,00881,A,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00882_A,00882,A,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00883_A,00883,A,you recollect the man mr harthouse
p00884_A,00884,A,oh perfectly
p00885_A,00885,A,his face and his manner and what he said
p00886_A,00886,A,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00887_A,00887,A,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00888_A,00888,A,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00889_A,00889,A,no certainly
p00890_A,00890,A,nor of any other such person
p00891_A,00891,A,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00892_A,00892,A,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00893_A,00893,A,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00894_A,00894,A,but you ll go down to morrow ma am all the same you ll go down just as if i was there it will make no difference to you
p00895_A,00895,A,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00896_A,00896,A,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00897_A,00897,A,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00898_A,00898,A,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00899_A,00899,A,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again
p00900_A,00900,A,what do you mean ma am
p00901_A,00901,A,bitzer present my compliments to young mr thomas and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup with a glass of india ale mr thomas these plain viands being on table i thought you might be tempted

p00903_A,00903,A,how is mr harthouse mr tom
p00904_A,00904,A,oh he s all right

p00907_A,00907,A,the kind of gentleman now whom one might wager to be a good shot
p00908_A,00908,A,crack
p00909_A,00909,A,mr harthouse is a great favourite of mine as indeed he is of most people may we expect to see him again shortly mr tom
p00910_A,00910,A,why i expect to see him to morrow
p00911_A,00911,A,good news
p00912_A,00912,A,i have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here and i am going to dine with him afterwards i believe he is not coming down to the country house for a week or so being due somewhere else at least he says so but i shouldn t wonder if he was to stop here over sunday and stray that way
p00913_A,00913,A,which reminds me would you remember a message to your sister mr tom if i was to charge you with one
p00914_A,00914,A,well i ll try if it isn t a long un
p00915_A,00915,A,it is merely my respectful compliments and i fear i may not trouble her with my society this week being still a little nervous and better perhaps by my poor self
p00916_A,00916,A,oh if that s all it wouldn t much matter even if i was to forget it for loo s not likely to think of you unless she sees you well mrs sparsit i must be off
p00917_A,00917,A,my dear child will you not bear with my society for a little while
p00918_A,00918,A,not here
p00919_A,00919,A,where louisa

p00921_A,00921,A,but we have so little time to make so much of and i have come so far and am altogether so devoted and distracted there never was a slave at once so devoted and ill used by his mistress to look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life and to be received in your frozen manner is heart rending
p00922_A,00922,A,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00923_A,00923,A,but we must meet my dear louisa where shall we meet shall i ride up to the house a few minutes hence innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me
p00924_A,00924,A,no
p00925_A,00925,A,louisa
p00926_A,00926,A,father i want to speak to you
p00927_A,00927,A,what is the matter how strange you look and good heaven have you come here exposed to this storm
p00928_A,00928,A,yes
p00929_A,00929,A,what is it i conjure you louisa tell me what is the matter
p00930_A,00930,A,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00931_A,00931,A,yes louisa
p00932_A,00932,A,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00933_A,00933,A,curse the hour curse the hour
p00934_A,00934,A,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00935_A,00935,A,yes louisa
p00936_A,00936,A,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00937_A,00937,A,no no my poor child
p00938_A,00938,A,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00939_A,00939,A,o no no no louisa
p00940_A,00940,A,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00941_A,00941,A,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00942_A,00942,A,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00943_A,00943,A,and you so young louisa
p00944_A,00944,A,and i so young in this condition father for i show you now without fear or favour the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know it you proposed my husband to me i took him i never made a pretence to him or you that i loved him i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom i made that wild escape into something visionary and have slowly found out how wild it was but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him it matters little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors when i was irrevocably married there rose up into rebellion against the tie the old strife made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me father until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul
p00945_A,00945,A,louisa
p00946_A,00946,A,i do not reproach you father i make no complaint i am here with another object
p00947_A,00947,A,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00948_A,00948,A,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00949_A,00949,A,for you louisa
p00950_A,00950,A,when was i brought to this room
p00951_A,00951,A,last night louisa
p00952_A,00952,A,who brought me here
p00953_A,00953,A,sissy i believe
p00954_A,00954,A,why do you believe so
p00955_A,00955,A,because i found her here this morning she didn t come to my bedside to wake me as she always does and i went to look for her she was not in her own room either and i went looking for her all over the house until i found her here taking care of you and cooling your head will you see father sissy said i was to tell him when you woke
p00956_A,00956,A,what a beaming face you have jane
p00957_A,00957,A,have i i am very glad you think so i am sure it must be sissy s doing
p00958_A,00958,A,you can tell father if you will it was you who made my room so cheerful and gave it this look of welcome
p00959_A,00959,A,my dear louisa my poor daughter my unfortunate child it would be hopeless for me louisa to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed i have been and still am by what broke upon me last night the ground on which i stand has ceased to be solid under my feet the only support on which i leaned and the strength of which it seemed and still does seem impossible to question has given way in an instant i am stunned by these discoveries i have no selfish meaning in what i say but i find the shock of what broke upon me last night to be very heavy indeed i will not say louisa that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago it would have been better for us both better for your peace and better for mine for i am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind i had proved my my system to myself and i have rigidly administered it and i must bear the responsibility of its failures i only entreat you to believe my favourite child that i have meant to do right
p00960_A,00960,A,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00961_A,00961,A,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00962_A,00962,A,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00963_A,00963,A,i hope i have not disturbed you i have come to ask if you would let me stay with you
p00964_A,00964,A,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00965_A,00965,A,am i i would be something to you if i might
p00966_A,00966,A,what
p00967_A,00967,A,whatever you want most if i could be that at all events i would like to try to be as near it as i can and however far off that may be i will never tire of trying will you let me
p00968_A,00968,A,my father sent you to ask me
p00969_A,00969,A,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00970_A,00970,A,at least what
p00971_A,00971,A,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00972_A,00972,A,have i always hated you so much
p00973_A,00973,A,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try
p00974_A,00974,A,first sissy do you know what i am i am so proud and so hardened so confused and troubled so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself that everything is stormy dark and wicked to me does not that repel you
p00975_A,00975,A,no
p00976_A,00976,A,i am so unhappy and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste that if i had been bereft of sense to this hour and instead of being as learned as you think me had to begin to acquire the simplest truths i could not want a guide to peace contentment honour all the good of which i am quite devoid more abjectly than i do does not that repel you
p00977_A,00977,A,no
p00978_A,00978,A,forgive me pity me help me have compassion on my great need and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart
p00979_A,00979,A,well i don t know she was off somewhere at daybreak this morning she s always full of mystery i hate her so i do that white chap he s always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow
p00980_A,00980,A,where were you last night tom
p00981_A,00981,A,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p00982_A,00982,A,i was prevented from coming detained
p00983_A,00983,A,detained two of us were detained i was detained looking for you till i lost every train but the mail it would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night and have to walk home through a pond i was obliged to sleep in town after all
p00984_A,00984,A,where
p00985_A,00985,A,where why in my own bed at bounderby s
p00986_A,00986,A,did you see your sister
p00987_A,00987,A,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off
p00988_A,00988,A,beg your pardon sir you re wanted sir if you please beg your pardon sir young lady outside sir wishes to see you
p00989_A,00989,A,outside where
p00990_A,00990,A,i speak to mr harthouse
p00991_A,00991,A,if i do not understand and i do not sir what your honour as a gentleman binds you to in other matters i am sure i may rely upon it to keep my visit secret and to keep secret what i am going to say i will rely upon it if you will tell me i may so far trust
p00992_A,00992,A,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now
p00993_A,00993,A,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p00994_A,00994,A,i left her within an hour
p00995_A,00995,A,at
p00996_A,00996,A,at her father s
p00997_A,00997,A,she hurried there last night she arrived there in great agitation and was insensible all through the night i live at her father s and was with her you may be sure sir you will never see her again as long as you live
p00998_A,00998,A,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p00999_A,00999,A,i have no charge from her
p01000_A,01000,A,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p01001_A,01001,A,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p01002_A,01002,A,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p01003_A,01003,A,it is still true there is no hope
p01004_A,01004,A,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p01005_A,01005,A,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p01006_A,01006,A,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned
p01007_A,01007,A,yes
p01008_A,01008,A,will you oblige me by confiding it
p01009_A,01009,A,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p01010_A,01010,A,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p01011_A,01011,A,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p01012_A,01012,A,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence
p01013_A,01013,A,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p01014_A,01014,A,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p01015_A,01015,A,my name
p01016_A,01016,A,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p01017_A,01017,A,sissy jupe
p01018_A,01018,A,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p01019_A,01019,A,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p01020_A,01020,A,send my fellow here
p01021_A,01021,A,gone to bed sir
p01022_A,01022,A,now tom gradgrind here s a lady here mrs sparsit you know mrs sparsit who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb
p01023_A,01023,A,you have missed my letter
p01024_A,01024,A,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p01025_A,01025,A,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p01026_A,01026,A,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse
p01027_A,01027,A,indeed
p01028_A,01028,A,ah indeed and in that conversation
p01029_A,01029,A,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p01030_A,01030,A,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p01031_A,01031,A,undoubtedly she is here
p01032_A,01032,A,here
p01033_A,01033,A,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p01034_A,01034,A,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p01035_A,01035,A,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p01036_A,01036,A,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone
p01037_A,01037,A,my dear bounderby
p01038_A,01038,A,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p01039_A,01039,A,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p01040_A,01040,A,i thought you couldn t make em
p01041_A,01041,A,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p01042_A,01042,A,i never mentioned his name
p01043_A,01043,A,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p01044_A,01044,A,who do you mean by we
p01045_A,01045,A,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p01046_A,01046,A,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p01047_A,01047,A,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p01048_A,01048,A,i don t see it at all sir
p01049_A,01049,A,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p01050_A,01050,A,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p01051_A,01051,A,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p01052_A,01052,A,you d like to keep her here for a time
p01053_A,01053,A,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p01054_A,01054,A,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p01055_A,01055,A,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p01056_A,01056,A,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p01057_A,01057,A,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p01058_A,01058,A,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p01059_A,01059,A,bounderby this is unreasonable
p01060_A,01060,A,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p01061_A,01061,A,not i fear to spare me
p01062_A,01062,A,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p01063_A,01063,A,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p01064_A,01064,A,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p01065_A,01065,A,what do i mean bounderby
p01066_A,01066,A,by your visiting proposition
p01067_A,01067,A,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p01068_A,01068,A,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p01069_A,01069,A,if you put it in those terms
p01070_A,01070,A,what made you think of this
p01071_A,01071,A,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p01072_A,01072,A,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p01073_A,01073,A,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p01074_A,01074,A,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p01075_A,01075,A,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p01076_A,01076,A,who is it
p01077_A,01077,A,it is mr bounderby and your brother mr tom and a young woman who says her name is rachael and that you know her
p01078_A,01078,A,what do they want sissy dear
p01079_A,01079,A,they want to see you rachael has been crying and seems angry
p01080_A,01080,A,you have seen me once before young lady you have seen me young lady once before
p01081_A,01081,A,i have
p01082_A,01082,A,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p01083_A,01083,A,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p01084_A,01084,A,why couldn t you say so young tom
p01085_A,01085,A,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p01086_A,01086,A,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p01087_A,01087,A,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p01088_A,01088,A,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p01089_A,01089,A,did you offer him a bank note
p01090_A,01090,A,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p01091_A,01091,A,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p01092_A,01092,A,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p01093_A,01093,A,i am very very sorry
p01094_A,01094,A,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p01095_A,01095,A,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p01096_A,01096,A,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p01097_A,01097,A,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01098_A,01098,A,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01099_A,01099,A,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01100_A,01100,A,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01101_A,01101,A,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01102_A,01102,A,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01103_A,01103,A,what what young lady in the name of mercy was left the poor lad to do the masters against him on one hand the men against him on the other he only wantin to work hard in peace and do what he felt right can a man have no soul of his own no mind of his own must he go wrong all through wi this side or must he go wrong all through wi that or else be hunted like a hare
p01104_A,01104,A,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p01105_A,01105,A,you need have no fear of that young lady he is sure
p01106_A,01106,A,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01107_A,01107,A,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01108_A,01108,A,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p01109_A,01109,A,good night father
p01110_A,01110,A,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p01111_A,01111,A,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p01112_A,01112,A,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p01113_A,01113,A,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p01114_A,01114,A,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p01115_A,01115,A,then i will come next night too
p01116_A,01116,A,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p01117_A,01117,A,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p01118_A,01118,A,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p01119_A,01119,A,very honest
p01120_A,01120,A,i misdoubt if there is as many as twenty left in all this place who have any trust in the poor dear lad now if it hadn t been mercifully brought about that i was to have you to speak to times are when i think my mind would not have kept right but i get hope and strength through you and you believe that though appearances may rise against him he will be proved clear
p01121_A,01121,A,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01122_A,01122,A,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01123_A,01123,A,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01124_A,01124,A,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01125_A,01125,A,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01126_A,01126,A,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01127_A,01127,A,that is a dreadful thought
p01128_A,01128,A,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01129_A,01129,A,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01130_A,01130,A,but he is in none of them he has been sought for in all and he s not there
p01131_A,01131,A,true
p01132_A,01132,A,he d walk the journey in two days if he was footsore and couldn t walk i sent him in the letter he got the money to ride lest he should have none of his own to spare
p01133_A,01133,A,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01134_A,01134,A,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01135_A,01135,A,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go

p01139_A,01139,A,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p01140_A,01140,A,why what do you mean by this i ask you what do you mean by this mrs sparsit ma am
p01141_A,01141,A,sir
p01142_A,01142,A,why don t you mind your own business ma am how dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs
p01143_A,01143,A,my dear josiah my darling boy i am not to blame it s not my fault josiah i told this lady over and over again that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you but she would do it
p01144_A,01144,A,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p01145_A,01145,A,my own boy she threatened me that if i resisted her i should be brought by constables and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a such a fine house as this indeed indeed it is not my fault my dear noble stately boy i have always lived quiet and secret josiah my dear i have never broken the condition once i have never said i was your mother i have admired you at a distance and if i have come to town sometimes with long times between to take a proud peep at you i have done it unbeknown my love and gone away again
p01146_A,01146,A,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p01147_A,01147,A,me unnatural me inhuman to my dear boy
p01148_A,01148,A,dear yes dear in his self made prosperity madam i dare say not very dear however when you deserted him in his infancy and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother
p01149_A,01149,A,i deserted my josiah now lord forgive you sir for your wicked imaginations and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother who died in my arms before josiah was born may you repent of it sir and live to know better
p01150_A,01150,A,do you deny then madam that you left your son to to be brought up in the gutter
p01151_A,01151,A,josiah in the gutter no such a thing sir never for shame on you my dear boy knows and will give you to know that though he come of humble parents he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful and i ve his books at home to show it aye have i and my dear boy knows and will give you to know sir that after his beloved father died when he was eight years old his mother too could pinch a bit as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it to help him out in life and put him prentice and a steady lad he was and a kind master he had to lend him a hand and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving and i ll give you to know sir for this my dear boy won t that though his mother kept but a little village shop he never forgot her but pensioned me on thirty pound a year more than i want for i put by out of it only making the condition that i was to keep down in my own part and make no boasts about him and not trouble him and i never have except with looking at him once a year when he has never knowed it and it s right that i should keep down in my own part and i have no doubts that if i was here i should do a many unbefitting things and i am well contented and i can keep my pride in my josiah to myself and i can love for love s own sake and i am ashamed of you sir for your slanders and suspicions and i never stood here before nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no and i shouldn t be here now if it hadn t been for being brought here and for shame upon you oh for shame to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son with my son standing here to tell you so different
p01152_A,01152,A,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p01153_A,01153,A,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael

p01173_A,01173,A,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p01174_A,01174,A,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p01175_A,01175,A,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p01176_A,01176,A,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p01177_A,01177,A,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p01178_A,01178,A,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p01179_A,01179,A,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p01180_A,01180,A,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p01181_A,01181,A,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p01182_A,01182,A,sissy has effected it father
p01183_A,01183,A,it is always you my child
p01184_A,01184,A,we had our fears before yesterday and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last night and heard what passed being close to rachael all the time i went to him when no one saw and said to him he was in a tremble before i whispered to him and he started and trembled more then and said i thought of father s old circus i have not forgotten where mr sleary goes at this time of year and i read of him in a paper only the other day i told him to hurry there and tell his name and ask mr sleary to hide him till i came he said and i saw him shrink away among the people

p01193_A,01193,A,i don t see why so many people are employed in situations of trust so many people out of so many will be dishonest i have heard you talk a hundred times of its being a law how can i help laws you have comforted others with such things father comfort yourself

p01205_A,01205,A,bitzer have you a heart
p01206_A,01206,A,the circulation sir couldn t be carried on without one no man sir acquainted with the facts established by harvey relating to the circulation of the blood can doubt that i have a heart
p01207_A,01207,A,is it accessible to any compassionate influence
p01208_A,01208,A,it is accessible to reason sir and to nothing else
p01209_A,01209,A,what motive even what motive in reason can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth and crushing his miserable father see his sister here pity us
p01210_A,01210,A,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good
p01211_A,01211,A,if this is solely a question of self interest with you
p01212_A,01212,A,i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir but i am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self interest what you must always appeal to is a person s self interest it s your only hold we are so constituted i was brought up in that catechism when i was very young sir as you are aware
p01213_A,01213,A,what sum of money will you set against your expected promotion
p01214_A,01214,A,thank you sir for hinting at the proposal but i will not set any sum against it knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative i have gone over the calculations in my mind and i find that to compound a felony even on very high terms indeed would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the bank

p01242_A,01242,A,then suppose you try ma am you can take your own time for going ma am but perhaps in the meanwhile it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind to eat her meals by herself and not to be intruded upon i really ought to apologise to you being only josiah bounderby of coketown for having stood in your light so long because i can take the opportunity of saying a word to you before you go mrs sparsit ma am i rather think you are cramped here do you know it appears to me that under my humble roof there s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people s affairs and it appears to my poor judgment
p00000_B,00000,B,sissy jupe sir
p00001_B,00001,B,sissy is not a name don t call yourself sissy call yourself cecilia
p00002_B,00002,B,it s father as calls me sissy sir

p00006_B,00006,B,if you please sir when they can get any to break they do break horses in the ring sir
p00007_B,00007,B,you mustn t tell us about the ring here very well then describe your father as a horsebreaker he doctors sick horses i dare say
p00008_B,00008,B,oh yes sir
p00009_B,00009,B,very well then he is a veterinary surgeon a farrier and horsebreaker give me your definition of a horse girl number twenty unable to define a horse girl number twenty possessed of no facts in reference to one of the commonest of animals some boy s definition of a horse bitzer yours bitzer your definition of a horse
p00010_B,00010,B,quadruped graminivorous forty teeth namely twenty four grinders four eye teeth and twelve incisive sheds coat in the spring in marshy countries sheds hoofs too hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron age known by marks in mouth
p00011_B,00011,B,now girl number twenty you know what a horse is
p00012_B,00012,B,very well that s a horse now let me ask you girls and boys would you paper a room with representations of horses
p00013_B,00013,B,you must paper it whether you like it or not don t tell us you wouldn t paper it what do you mean boy
p00014_B,00014,B,i ll explain to you then why you wouldn t paper a room with representations of horses do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality in fact do you of course no why then you are not to see anywhere what you don t see in fact you are not to have anywhere what you don t have in fact what is called taste is only another name for fact this is a new principle a discovery a great discovery now i ll try you again suppose you were going to carpet a room would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it girl number twenty so you would carpet your room or your husband s room if you were a grown woman and had a husband with representations of flowers would you why would you
p00015_B,00015,B,if you please sir i am very fond of flowers
p00016_B,00016,B,it wouldn t hurt them sir they wouldn t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy
p00017_B,00017,B,ay ay ay but you mustn t fancy that s it you are never to fancy
p00018_B,00018,B,you are not cecilia jupe to do anything of that kind
p00019_B,00019,B,fact fact fact
p00020_B,00020,B,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure
p00021_B,00021,B,mr m choakumchild we only wait for you
p00022_B,00022,B,wanted to see what it was like
p00023_B,00023,B,what it was like
p00024_B,00024,B,yes father
p00025_B,00025,B,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00026_B,00026,B,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00027_B,00027,B,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00028_B,00028,B,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00029_B,00029,B,tired of what
p00030_B,00030,B,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00031_B,00031,B,say not another word you are childish i will hear no more what would your best friends say louisa do you attach no value to their good opinion what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say
p00032_B,00032,B,no as wet as a sop a foot of water in it
p00033_B,00033,B,cold i was born with inflammation of the lungs and of everything else i believe that was capable of inflammation for years ma am i was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen i was so sickly that i was always moaning and groaning i was so ragged and dirty that you wouldn t have touched me with a pair of tongs how i fought through it i don t know i was determined i suppose i have been a determined character in later life and i suppose i was then here i am mrs gradgrind anyhow and nobody to thank for my being here but myself my mother bolted ma am my mother left me to my grandmother and according to the best of my remembrance my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived if i got a little pair of shoes by any chance she would take em off and sell em for drink why i have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four teen glasses of liquor before breakfast she kept a chandler s shop and kept me in an egg box that was the cot of my infancy an old egg box as soon as i was big enough to run away of course i ran away then i became a young vagabond and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me they were right they had no business to do anything else i was a nuisance an incumbrance and a pest i know that very well i was to pull through it i suppose mrs gradgrind whether i was to do it or not ma am i did it i pulled through it though nobody threw me out a rope vagabond errand boy vagabond labourer porter clerk chief manager small partner josiah bounderby of coketown those are the antecedents and the culmination josiah bounderby of coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops mrs gradgrind and was first able to tell the time upon a dial plate from studying the steeple clock of st giles s church london under the direction of a drunken cripple who was a convicted thief and an incorrigible vagrant tell josiah bounderby of coketown of your district schools and your model schools and your training schools and your whole kettle of fish of schools and josiah bounderby of coketown tells you plainly all right all correct he hadn t such advantages but let us have hard headed solid fisted people the education that made him won t do for everybody he knows well such and such his education was however and you may force him to swallow boiling fat but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life
p00034_B,00034,B,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00035_B,00035,B,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00036_B,00036,B,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00037_B,00037,B,that s the reason
p00038_B,00038,B,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly
p00039_B,00039,B,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00040_B,00040,B,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00041_B,00041,B,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00042_B,00042,B,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00043_B,00043,B,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00044_B,00044,B,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00045_B,00045,B,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00046_B,00046,B,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00047_B,00047,B,cecilia jupe by name
p00048_B,00048,B,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00049_B,00049,B,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00050_B,00050,B,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00051_B,00051,B,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00052_B,00052,B,pray mrs gradgrind what passed
p00053_B,00053,B,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00054_B,00054,B,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00055_B,00055,B,i am much of your opinion
p00056_B,00056,B,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00057_B,00057,B,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00058_B,00058,B,not the least in the world as long as you do it at once i never wear gloves i didn t climb up the ladder in them shouldn t be so high up if i had
p00059_B,00059,B,you can take one mr bounderby
p00060_B,00060,B,always my pet ain t you louisa good bye louisa
p00061_B,00061,B,what are you about loo you ll rub a hole in your face
p00062_B,00062,B,you may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like tom i wouldn t cry
p00063_B,00063,B,i was i was run after sir and i wanted to get away
p00064_B,00064,B,run after who would run after you
p00065_B,00065,B,yes sir
p00066_B,00066,B,no i wasn t sir not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say it s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn t known to the horse riders
p00067_B,00067,B,he frightened me so with his cruel faces
p00068_B,00068,B,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00069_B,00069,B,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week
p00070_B,00070,B,truly i think so bitzer turn you about and take yourself home jupe stay here a moment let me hear of your running in this manner any more boy and you will hear of me through the master of the school you understand what i mean go along
p00071_B,00071,B,gin
p00072_B,00072,B,dear no sir it s the nine oils
p00073_B,00073,B,the what
p00074_B,00074,B,the nine oils sir to rub father with
p00075_B,00075,B,then what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for
p00076_B,00076,B,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00077_B,00077,B,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00078_B,00078,B,and this is pod s end is it jupe
p00079_B,00079,B,this is it sir and if you wouldn t mind sir this is the house it s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it s only merrylegs and he only barks
p00080_B,00080,B,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00081_B,00081,B,father is not in our room sir if you wouldn t mind walking in i ll find him directly father must have gone down to the booth sir i don t know why he should go there but he must be there i ll bring him in a minute
p00082_B,00082,B,what does she mean back in a minute it s more than a mile off
p00083_B,00083,B,by your leaves gentlemen it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe
p00084_B,00084,B,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00085_B,00085,B,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00086_B,00086,B,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00087_B,00087,B,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00088_B,00088,B,kidderminster stow that
p00089_B,00089,B,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00090_B,00090,B,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00091_B,00091,B,has what has he missed
p00092_B,00092,B,missed his tip
p00093_B,00093,B,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00094_B,00094,B,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00095_B,00095,B,oh that is tip is it
p00096_B,00096,B,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00097_B,00097,B,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00098_B,00098,B,lower yourself then oh lord if you ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to let yourself down a bit
p00099_B,00099,B,this is a very obtrusive lad
p00100_B,00100,B,we d have had a young gentleman to meet you if we had known you were coming it s a pity you don t have a bespeak being so particular you re on the tight jeff ain t you
p00101_B,00101,B,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00102_B,00102,B,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00103_B,00103,B,yes i was
p00104_B,00104,B,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00105_B,00105,B,i never saw the man in my life
p00106_B,00106,B,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00107_B,00107,B,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00108_B,00108,B,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00109_B,00109,B,why has he been so very much goosed
p00110_B,00110,B,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00111_B,00111,B,a cackler here we go again
p00112_B,00112,B,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00113_B,00113,B,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00114_B,00114,B,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now
p00115_B,00115,B,perhaps so
p00116_B,00116,B,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00117_B,00117,B,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00118_B,00118,B,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00119_B,00119,B,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00120_B,00120,B,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00121_B,00121,B,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00122_B,00122,B,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00123_B,00123,B,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00124_B,00124,B,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00125_B,00125,B,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00126_B,00126,B,but even as an example to louisa of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity leads to and ends in think of it bounderby in that point of view
p00127_B,00127,B,yes
p00128_B,00128,B,well thquire ith it your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl thquire

p00137_B,00137,B,now good people all this is wanton waste of time let the girl understand the fact let her take it from me if you like who have been run away from myself here what s your name your father has absconded deserted you and you mustn t expect to see him again as long as you live
p00138_B,00138,B,i tell you what thquire to thpeak plain to you my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort and drop it they re a very good natur d people my people but they re accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh and if you don t act upon my advithe i m damned if i don t believe they ll pith you out o winder
p00139_B,00139,B,it is of no moment whether this person is to be expected back at any time or the contrary he is gone away and there is no present expectation of his return that i believe is agreed on all hands
p00140_B,00140,B,thath agreed thquire thick to that
p00141_B,00141,B,well then i who came here to inform the father of the poor girl jupe that she could not be received at the school any more in consequence of there being practical objections into which i need not enter to the reception there of the children of persons so employed am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal i am willing to take charge of you jupe and to educate you and provide for you the only condition over and above your good behaviour i make is that you decide now at once whether to accompany me or remain here also that if you accompany me now it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present these observations comprise the whole of the case
p00142_B,00142,B,at the thame time i mutht put in my word thquire tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen if you like thethilia to be prentitht you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth emma gordon in whothe lap you re a lying at prethent would be a mother to you and joth phine would be a thithter to you i don t pretend to be of the angel breed myself and i don t thay but what when you mith d your tip you d find me cut up rough and thwear an oath or two at you but what i thay thquire ith that good tempered or bad tempered i never did a horthe a injury yet no more than thwearing at him went and that i don t expect i thall begin otherwithe at my time of life with a rider i never wath much of a cackler thquire and i have thed my thay
p00143_B,00143,B,the only observation i will make to you jupe in the way of influencing your decision is that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education and that even your father himself from what i understand appears on your behalf to have known and felt that much be sure you know your own mind jupe i say no more be sure you know your own mind
p00144_B,00144,B,when father comes back how will he ever find me if i go away
p00145_B,00145,B,you may be quite at ease you may be quite at ease jupe on that score in such a case your father i apprehend must find out mr

p00154_B,00154,B,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl
p00155_B,00155,B,the girl is now waiting to know whether she is to go straight to the school or up to the lodge
p00156_B,00156,B,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00157_B,00157,B,of course she can if you wish it mr bounderby
p00158_B,00158,B,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00159_B,00159,B,indeed mr bounderby very thoughtful of you
p00160_B,00160,B,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00161_B,00161,B,are you speaking of young miss gradgrind mr bounderby
p00162_B,00162,B,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00163_B,00163,B,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00164_B,00164,B,louisa louisa louisa
p00165_B,00165,B,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00166_B,00166,B,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00167_B,00167,B,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00168_B,00168,B,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00169_B,00169,B,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00170_B,00170,B,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00171_B,00171,B,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00172_B,00172,B,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00173_B,00173,B,i do not sir deny it
p00174_B,00174,B,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00175_B,00175,B,it is true sir
p00176_B,00176,B,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00177_B,00177,B,yes sir it is unquestionably true
p00178_B,00178,B,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00179_B,00179,B,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00180_B,00180,B,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00181_B,00181,B,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00182_B,00182,B,jupe i have made up my mind to take you into my house and when you are not in attendance at the school to employ you about mrs gradgrind who is rather an invalid i have explained to miss louisa this is miss louisa the miserable but natural end of your late career and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past and is not to be referred to any more from this time you begin your history you are at present ignorant i know
p00183_B,00183,B,yes sir very
p00184_B,00184,B,i shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you of the advantages of the training you will receive you will be reclaimed and formed you have been in the habit now of reading to your father and those people i found you among i dare say
p00185_B,00185,B,only to father and merrylegs sir at least i mean to father when merrylegs was always there
p00186_B,00186,B,never mind merrylegs jupe i don t ask about him i understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father
p00187_B,00187,B,o yes sir thousands of times they were the happiest o of all the happy times we had together sir
p00188_B,00188,B,and what did you read to your father jupe
p00189_B,00189,B,about the fairies sir and the dwarf and the hunchback and the genies and about
p00190_B,00190,B,hush that is enough never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more bounderby this is a case for rigid training and i shall observe it with interest
p00191_B,00191,B,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00192_B,00192,B,tom i wonder
p00193_B,00193,B,i am sick of my life loo i hate it altogether and i hate everybody except you
p00194_B,00194,B,you don t hate sissy tom
p00195_B,00195,B,i hate to be obliged to call her jupe and she hates me
p00196_B,00196,B,no she does not tom i am sure
p00197_B,00197,B,she must she must just hate and detest the whole set out of us they ll bother her head off i think before they have done with her already she s getting as pale as wax and as heavy as i am as to me i am a donkey that s what i am i am as obstinate as one i am more stupid than one i get as much pleasure as one and i should like to kick like one
p00198_B,00198,B,not me i hope tom
p00199_B,00199,B,no loo i wouldn t hurt you i made an exception of you at first i don t know what this jolly old jaundiced jail would be without you
p00200_B,00200,B,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00201_B,00201,B,why of course i do what s the use of talking about it
p00202_B,00202,B,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00203_B,00203,B,well no more do i i am as bad as you in that respect and i am a mule too which you re not if father was determined to make me either a prig or a mule and i am not a prig why it stands to reason i must be a mule and so i am
p00204_B,00204,B,it s a great pity it s a great pity tom it s very unfortunate for both of us
p00205_B,00205,B,oh you you are a girl loo and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does i don t miss anything in you you are the only pleasure i have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like
p00206_B,00206,B,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it
p00207_B,00207,B,i wish i could collect all the facts we hear so much about and all the figures and all the people who found them out and i wish i could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together however when i go to live with old bounderby i ll have my revenge
p00208_B,00208,B,your revenge tom
p00209_B,00209,B,i mean i ll enjoy myself a little and go about and see something and hear something i ll recompense myself for the way in which i have been brought up
p00210_B,00210,B,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00211_B,00211,B,oh i don t mind that i shall very well know how to manage and smooth old bounderby
p00212_B,00212,B,what is your great mode of smoothing and managing tom is it a secret
p00213_B,00213,B,oh if it is a secret it s not far off it s you you are his little pet you are his favourite he ll do anything for you when he says to me what i don t like i shall say to him that ll bring him about or nothing will have you gone to sleep loo
p00214_B,00214,B,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00215_B,00215,B,you seem to find more to look at in it than ever i could find another of the advantages i suppose of being a girl
p00216_B,00216,B,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00217_B,00217,B,why there s one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home
p00218_B,00218,B,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00219_B,00219,B,not but what i shall be very unwilling both to leave you loo and to leave you here but i must go you know whether i like it or not and i had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence than where i should lose it altogether don t you see
p00220_B,00220,B,yes tom
p00221_B,00221,B,except that it is a fire it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks what do you see in it not a circus
p00222_B,00222,B,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00223_B,00223,B,wondering again
p00224_B,00224,B,i have such unmanageable thoughts that they will wonder
p00225_B,00225,B,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00226_B,00226,B,nonsense nonsense don t stand there and tell me such stuff louisa to my face when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father s ears i should never hear the last of it after all the trouble that has been taken with you after the lectures you have attended and the experiments you have seen after i have heard you myself when the whole of my right side has been benumbed going on with your master about combustion and calcination and calorification and i may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes i wish yes i really do wish that i had never had a family and then you would have known what it was to do without me
p00227_B,00227,B,to do unto others as i would that they should do unto me
p00228_B,00228,B,do you think so
p00229_B,00229,B,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00230_B,00230,B,you might not be the better for it sissy
p00231_B,00231,B,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00232_B,00232,B,i don t know that you are more useful to my mother and more pleasant with her than i can ever be you are pleasanter to yourself than i am to my self
p00233_B,00233,B,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00234_B,00234,B,mr and mrs m choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves i suppose sissy
p00235_B,00235,B,o no they know everything
p00236_B,00236,B,tell me some of your mistakes
p00237_B,00237,B,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00238_B,00238,B,national i think it must have been
p00239_B,00239,B,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00240_B,00240,B,you had better say national as he said so
p00241_B,00241,B,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00242_B,00242,B,what did you say
p00243_B,00243,B,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00244_B,00244,B,that was a great mistake of yours
p00245_B,00245,B,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00246_B,00246,B,of course it was
p00247_B,00247,B,then mr m choakumchild said he would try me once more and he said here are the stutterings
p00248_B,00248,B,statistics
p00249_B,00249,B,yes miss louisa they always remind me of stutterings and that s another of my mistakes of accidents upon the sea and i find mr m choakumchild said that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death what is the percentage and i said miss i said it was nothing
p00250_B,00250,B,nothing sissy
p00251_B,00251,B,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00252_B,00252,B,did your father know so much himself that he wished you to be well taught too sissy no one hears us and if any one did i am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question
p00253_B,00253,B,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00254_B,00254,B,your mother
p00255_B,00255,B,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00256_B,00256,B,did your father love her
p00257_B,00257,B,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00258_B,00258,B,yet he leaves you now sissy
p00259_B,00259,B,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00260_B,00260,B,tell me more about him i will never ask you again where did you live
p00261_B,00261,B,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00262_B,00262,B,to make the people laugh
p00263_B,00263,B,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00264_B,00264,B,and you were his comfort through everything
p00265_B,00265,B,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00266_B,00266,B,and he liked them
p00267_B,00267,B,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00268_B,00268,B,and your father was always kind to the last

p00271_B,00271,B,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00272_B,00272,B,finish by telling me how your father left you sissy now that i have asked you so much tell me the end the blame if there is any blame is mine not yours
p00273_B,00273,B,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and

p00334_B,00334,B,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money
p00335_B,00335,B,how much might that be
p00336_B,00336,B,why you d have to go to doctors commons with a suit and you d have to go to a court of common law with a suit and you d have to go to the house of lords with a suit and you d have to get an act of parliament to enable you to marry again and it would cost you if it was a case of very plain sailing i suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound perhaps twice the money
p00337_B,00337,B,there s no other law

p00367_B,00367,B,i am afraid it would sir
p00368_B,00368,B,i cannot disguise from you jupe that the result of your probation there has disappointed me has greatly disappointed me you have not acquired under mr and mrs m choakumchild anything like that amount of exact knowledge which i looked for you are extremely deficient in your facts your acquaintance with figures is very limited you are altogether backward and below the mark
p00369_B,00369,B,i am sorry sir but i know it is quite true yet i have tried hard sir
p00370_B,00370,B,yes yes i believe you have tried hard i have observed you and i can find no fault in that respect
p00371_B,00371,B,thank you sir i have thought sometimes that perhaps i tried to learn too much and that if i had asked to be allowed to try a little less i might have
p00372_B,00372,B,no jupe no no the course you pursued you pursued according to the system the system and there is no more to be said about it i can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers and that we began too late still as i have said already i am disappointed
p00373_B,00373,B,i wish i could have made a better acknowledgment sir of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you and of your protection of her
p00374_B,00374,B,don t shed tears don t shed tears i don t complain of you you are an affectionate earnest good young woman and and we must make that do
p00375_B,00375,B,thank you sir very much
p00376_B,00376,B,you are useful to mrs gradgrind and in a generally pervading way you are serviceable in the family also so i understand from miss louisa and indeed so i have observed myself i therefore hope that you can make yourself happy in those relations
p00377_B,00377,B,i should have nothing to wish sir if
p00378_B,00378,B,i understand you you still refer to your father i have heard from miss louisa that you still preserve that bottle well if your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful you would have been wiser on these points i will say no more
p00379_B,00379,B,yes father
p00380_B,00380,B,my dear i must speak with you alone and seriously come to me in my room after breakfast to morrow will you
p00381_B,00381,B,yes father
p00382_B,00382,B,your hands are rather cold louisa are you not well
p00383_B,00383,B,quite well father
p00384_B,00384,B,and cheerful
p00385_B,00385,B,i am as cheerful father as i usually am or usually have been
p00386_B,00386,B,that s well
p00387_B,00387,B,dear tom how long it is since you have been to see me
p00388_B,00388,B,why i have been otherwise engaged loo in the evenings and in the daytime old bounderby has been keeping me at it rather but i touch him up with you when he comes it too strong and so we preserve an understanding i say has father said anything particular to you to day or yesterday loo
p00389_B,00389,B,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00390_B,00390,B,ah that s what i mean do you know where he is to night
p00391_B,00391,B,no
p00392_B,00392,B,then i ll tell you he s with old bounderby they are having a regular confab together up at the bank why at the bank do you think well i ll tell you again to keep mrs sparsit s ears as far off as possible i expect you are very fond of me an t you loo
p00393_B,00393,B,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00394_B,00394,B,well sister of mine when you say that you are near my thoughts we might be so much oftener together mightn t we always together almost mightn t we it would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to i know what loo it would be a splendid thing for me it would be uncommonly jolly i say loo i thought i d come and just hint to you what was going on though i supposed you d most likely guess even if you didn t know i can t stay because i m engaged to some fellows to night you won t forget how fond you are of me
p00395_B,00395,B,no dear tom i won t forget
p00396_B,00396,B,that s a capital girl good bye loo
p00397_B,00397,B,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00398_B,00398,B,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00399_B,00399,B,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00400_B,00400,B,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00401_B,00401,B,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00402_B,00402,B,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00403_B,00403,B,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00404_B,00404,B,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00405_B,00405,B,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00406_B,00406,B,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00407_B,00407,B,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00408_B,00408,B,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00409_B,00409,B,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00410_B,00410,B,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00411_B,00411,B,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00412_B,00412,B,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00413_B,00413,B,shall i marry him
p00414_B,00414,B,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00415_B,00415,B,no father i do not
p00416_B,00416,B,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00417_B,00417,B,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00418_B,00418,B,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00419_B,00419,B,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00420_B,00420,B,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00421_B,00421,B,i speak of my own life father
p00422_B,00422,B,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00423_B,00423,B,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00424_B,00424,B,how matter what matter my dear
p00425_B,00425,B,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00426_B,00426,B,certainly my dear
p00427_B,00427,B,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00428_B,00428,B,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00429_B,00429,B,none father what does it matter
p00430_B,00430,B,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00431_B,00431,B,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00432_B,00432,B,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00433_B,00433,B,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00434_B,00434,B,my dear quite true quite true
p00435_B,00435,B,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00436_B,00436,B,my dear louisa you abundantly repay my care kiss me my dear girl i may assure you now my favourite child that i am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived mr bounderby is a very remarkable man and what little disparity can be said to exist between you if any is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired it has always been my object so to educate you as that you might while still in your early youth be if i may so express myself almost any age kiss me once more louisa now let us go and find your mother
p00437_B,00437,B,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him
p00438_B,00438,B,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00439_B,00439,B,whatever i am to call him mr gradgrind when he is married to louisa i must call him something it s impossible to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name i cannot call him josiah for the name is insupportable to me you yourself wouldn t hear of joe you very well know am i to call my own son in law mister not i believe unless the time has arrived when as an invalid i am to be trampled upon by my relations then what am i to call him as to the wedding all i ask louisa is and i ask it with a fluttering in my chest which actually extends to the soles of my feet that it may take place soon otherwise i know it is one of those subjects i shall never hear the last of
p00440_B,00440,B,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00441_B,00441,B,thank you sir
p00442_B,00442,B,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00443_B,00443,B,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00444_B,00444,B,mrs sparsit ma am i am going to astonish you
p00445_B,00445,B,yes sir

p00450_B,00450,B,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00451_B,00451,B,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00452_B,00452,B,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00453_B,00453,B,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00454_B,00454,B,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00455_B,00455,B,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00456_B,00456,B,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00457_B,00457,B,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00458_B,00458,B,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00459_B,00459,B,you ll have your own private apartments and you ll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it and you ll have your maid to attend upon you and you ll have your light porter to protect you and you ll be what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable
p00460_B,00460,B,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00461_B,00461,B,ladies and gentlemen i am josiah bounderby of coketown since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness i suppose i must acknowledge the same though as you all know me and know what i am and what my extraction was you won t expect a speech from a man who when he sees a post says and when he sees a pump says and is not to be got to call a post a pump or a pump a post or either of them a toothpick if you want a speech this morning my friend and father in law tom gradgrind is a member of parliament and you know where to get it i am not your man however if i feel a little independent when i look around this table to day and reflect how little i thought of marrying tom gradgrind s daughter when i was a ragged street boy who never washed his face unless it was at a pump and that not oftener than once a fortnight i hope i may be excused so i hope you like my feeling independent if you don t i can t help it i do feel independent now i have mentioned and you have mentioned that i am this day married to tom gradgrind s daughter i am very glad to be so it has long been my wish to be so i have watched her bringing up and i believe she is worthy of me at the same time not to deceive you i believe i am worthy of her so i thank you on both our parts for the good will you have shown towards us and the best wish i can give the unmarried part of the present company is this i hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as i have found and i hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found

p00468_B,00468,B,what are the restless wretches doing now
p00469_B,00469,B,merely going on in the old way ma am uniting and leaguing and engaging to stand by one another
p00470_B,00470,B,it is much to be regretted that the united masters allow of any such class combinations
p00471_B,00471,B,yes ma am
p00472_B,00472,B,being united themselves they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man
p00473_B,00473,B,they have done that ma am but it rather fell through ma am
p00474_B,00474,B,i do not pretend to understand these things my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere and mr sparsit as a powler being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions i only know that these people must be conquered and that it s high time it was done once for all
p00475_B,00475,B,yes ma am you couldn t put it clearer i am sure ma am
p00476_B,00476,B,has it been a busy day bitzer

p00483_B,00483,B,i beg your pardon ma am it s quite true that you did object to names being used and they re always best avoided
p00484_B,00484,B,please to remember that i have a charge here i hold a trust here bitzer under mr bounderby however improbable both mr bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago that he would ever become my patron making me an annual compliment i cannot but regard him in that light from mr bounderby i have received every acknowledgment of my social station and every recognition of my family descent that i could possibly expect more far more therefore to my patron i will be scrupulously true and i do not consider i will not consider i cannot consider that i should be scrupulously true if i allowed names to be mentioned under this roof that are unfortunately most unfortunately no doubt of that connected with his no bitzer say an individual and i will hear you say mr thomas and you must excuse me
p00485_B,00485,B,with the usual exception ma am of an individual
p00486_B,00486,B,ah h
p00487_B,00487,B,an individual ma am has never been what he ought to have been since he first came into the place he is a dissipated extravagant idler he is not worth his salt ma am he wouldn t get it either if he hadn t a friend and relation at court ma am
p00488_B,00488,B,ah h
p00489_B,00489,B,i only hope ma am that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on otherwise ma am we know out of whose pocket that money comes
p00490_B,00490,B,ah h
p00491_B,00491,B,he is to be pitied ma am the last party i have alluded to is to be pitied ma am
p00492_B,00492,B,yes bitzer i have always pitied the delusion always
p00493_B,00493,B,as to an individual ma am he is as improvident as any of the people in this town and you know what their improvidence is ma am no one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does
p00494_B,00494,B,they would do well to take example by you bitzer
p00495_B,00495,B,thank you ma am but since you do refer to me now look at me ma am i have put by a little ma am already that gratuity which i receive at christmas ma am i never touch it i don t even go the length of my wages though they re not high ma am why can t they do as i have done ma am what one person can do another can do as to their wanting recreations ma am it s stuff and nonsense i don t want recreations i never did and i never shall i don t like em as to their combining together there are many of them i have no doubt that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then whether in money or good will and improve their livelihood then why don t they improve it ma am it s the first consideration of a rational creature and it s what they pretend to want
p00496_B,00496,B,pretend indeed
p00497_B,00497,B,i am sure we are constantly hearing ma am till it becomes quite nauseous concerning their wives and families why look at me ma am i don t want a wife and family why should they
p00498_B,00498,B,because they are improvident
p00499_B,00499,B,yes ma am that s where it is if they were more provident and less perverse ma am what would they do they would say or as the case might be ma am
p00500_B,00500,B,to be sure

p00513_B,00513,B,is it possible excuse me you are not a native i think
p00514_B,00514,B,no sir it was once my good or ill fortune as it may be before i became a widow to move in a very different sphere my husband was a powler
p00515_B,00515,B,beg your pardon really was
p00516_B,00516,B,a powler
p00517_B,00517,B,powler family you must be very much bored here
p00518_B,00518,B,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00519_B,00519,B,very philosophical and very exemplary and laudable and
p00520_B,00520,B,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00521_B,00521,B,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00522_B,00522,B,no sir he does not
p00523_B,00523,B,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00524_B,00524,B,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00525_B,00525,B,quite an eternity i think he married gradgrind s daughter
p00526_B,00526,B,yes he had that honour
p00527_B,00527,B,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00528_B,00528,B,indeed sir is she
p00529_B,00529,B,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00530_B,00530,B,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00531_B,00531,B,i give you my honour mrs powler that i never was so astonished in my life i assure you mrs powler that the father s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity i am obliged to you of all things for correcting so absurd a mistake pray excuse my intrusion many thanks good day
p00532_B,00532,B,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00533_B,00533,B,spends a deal of money on his dress ma am
p00534_B,00534,B,it must be admitted that it s very tasteful
p00535_B,00535,B,yes ma am if that s worth the money besides which ma am he looks to me as if he gamed
p00536_B,00536,B,it s immoral to game
p00537_B,00537,B,it s ridiculous ma am because the chances are against the players
p00538_B,00538,B,o you fool
p00539_B,00539,B,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00540_B,00540,B,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00541_B,00541,B,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00542_B,00542,B,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00543_B,00543,B,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00544_B,00544,B,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00545_B,00545,B,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00546_B,00546,B,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00547_B,00547,B,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00548_B,00548,B,now how am i to take this
p00549_B,00549,B,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00550_B,00550,B,have you none of your own
p00551_B,00551,B,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00552_B,00552,B,you are a singular politician
p00553_B,00553,B,pardon me i have not even that merit we are the largest party in the state i assure you mrs bounderby if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together
p00554_B,00554,B,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards
p00555_B,00555,B,never mind that now
p00556_B,00556,B,well then don t begin with me
p00557_B,00557,B,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p00558_B,00558,B,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00559_B,00559,B,no such luck sir
p00560_B,00560,B,so much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for so much the more so much the more
p00561_B,00561,B,i believe you
p00562_B,00562,B,a very good fellow indeed
p00563_B,00563,B,you think so don t you
p00564_B,00564,B,what a comical brother in law you are
p00565_B,00565,B,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean
p00566_B,00566,B,you are a piece of caustic tom
p00567_B,00567,B,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p00568_B,00568,B,don t mind me but take care when his wife is by you know
p00569_B,00569,B,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p00570_B,00570,B,that s the past tense tom we are in the present tense now
p00571_B,00571,B,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p00572_B,00572,B,good very quaint though you don t mean it
p00573_B,00573,B,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p00574_B,00574,B,my dear fellow what am i bound to suppose when i find two married people living in harmony and happiness
p00575_B,00575,B,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p00576_B,00576,B,very dutiful in your interesting sister
p00577_B,00577,B,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p00578_B,00578,B,it was charming tom
p00579_B,00579,B,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p00580_B,00580,B,perfectly delightful and she gets on so placidly
p00581_B,00581,B,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p00582_B,00582,B,ay ay has resources of her own
p00583_B,00583,B,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p00584_B,00584,B,formed his daughter on his own model
p00585_B,00585,B,his daughter ah and everybody else why he formed me that way
p00586_B,00586,B,impossible
p00587_B,00587,B,he did though i mean to say mr harthouse that when i first left home and went to old bounderby s i was as flat as a warming pan and knew no more about life than any oyster does
p00588_B,00588,B,come tom i can hardly believe that a joke s a joke
p00589_B,00589,B,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p00590_B,00590,B,and your intelligent sister
p00591_B,00591,B,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p00592_B,00592,B,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister
p00593_B,00593,B,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no
p00594_B,00594,B,come it s late be off

p00599_B,00599,B,oh my friends and fellow men i do not wonder that you the prostrate sons of labour are incredulous of the existence of such a man but he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed and judas iscariot existed and castlereagh existed and this man exists my friends by virtue o my office as your president i askes o our friend slackbridge who may be a little over hetter in this business to take his seat whiles this man stephen blackpool is heern you all know this man stephen blackpool you know him awlung o his misfort ns and his good name

p00706_B,00706,B,mrs bounderby i esteem it a most fortunate accident that i find you alone here i have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you your brother my young friend tom
p00707_B,00707,B,being so impulsive
p00708_B,00708,B,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00709_B,00709,B,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00710_B,00710,B,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00711_B,00711,B,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00712_B,00712,B,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00713_B,00713,B,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00714_B,00714,B,thank you i claim to deserve it you know how little i do claim but i will go that length you have done so much for him you are so fond of him your whole life mrs bounderby expresses such charming self forgetfulness on his account pardon me again i am running wide of the subject i am interested in him for his own sake mrs bounderby it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother s years if he is heedless inconsiderate and expensive a little dissipated in the common phrase is he
p00715_B,00715,B,yes
p00716_B,00716,B,allow me to be frank do you think he games at all i think he makes bets
p00717_B,00717,B,i know he does
p00718_B,00718,B,of course he loses
p00719_B,00719,B,yes
p00720_B,00720,B,everybody does lose who bets may i hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes acquit me of impertinent curiosity my dear mrs bounderby i think tom may be gradually falling into trouble and i wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience shall i say again for his sake is that necessary candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father
p00721_B,00721,B,i do not think it likely
p00722_B,00722,B,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00723_B,00723,B,i do not think that likely either
p00724_B,00724,B,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00725_B,00725,B,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00726_B,00726,B,so spirited too
p00727_B,00727,B,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00728_B,00728,B,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00729_B,00729,B,to relieve you from needless apprehension and as this confidence regarding your brother which i prize i am sure above all possible things has been established between us i obey i cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word look and act of his life of the affection of his best friend of the devotion of his best friend of her unselfishness of her sacrifice the return he makes her within my observation is a very poor one what she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude not his ill humour and caprice careless fellow as i am i am not so indifferent mrs bounderby as to be regardless of this vice in your brother or inclined to consider it a venial offence in a word it is to correct your brother in this mrs bounderby that i must aspire my better knowledge of his circumstances and my direction and advice in extricating them rather valuable i hope as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale will give me some influence over him and all i gain i shall certainly use towards this end i have said enough and more than enough i seem to be protesting that i am a sort of good fellow when upon my honour i have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect and openly announce that i am nothing of the sort yonder among the trees is your brother himself no doubt just come down as he seems to be loitering in this direction it may be as well perhaps to walk towards him and throw ourselves in his way he has been very silent and doleful of late perhaps his brotherly conscience is touched if there are such things as consciences though upon my honour i hear of them much too often to believe in them
p00730_B,00730,B,whose name tom have you been carving on the trees
p00731_B,00731,B,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p00732_B,00732,B,you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature s on the bark tom
p00733_B,00733,B,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p00734_B,00734,B,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00735_B,00735,B,mercenary who is not mercenary ask my sister
p00736_B,00736,B,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00737_B,00737,B,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it
p00738_B,00738,B,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00739_B,00739,B,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p00740_B,00740,B,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p00741_B,00741,B,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p00742_B,00742,B,my good fellow so am i
p00743_B,00743,B,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p00744_B,00744,B,tom you are inconsiderate you expect too much of your sister you have had money of her you dog you know you have
p00745_B,00745,B,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p00746_B,00746,B,but my dear tom if your sister has not got it
p00747_B,00747,B,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p00748_B,00748,B,my dear tom let me try to be your banker
p00749_B,00749,B,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p00750_B,00750,B,what is the present need tom three figures out with them say what they are
p00751_B,00751,B,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p00752_B,00752,B,whelp whelp what an ass you are
p00753_B,00753,B,well it may be of more use by and by and my good fellow if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you i may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself
p00754_B,00754,B,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p00755_B,00755,B,now you see tom every man is selfish in everything he does and i am exactly like the rest of my fellow creatures i am desperately intent on your softening towards your sister which you ought to do and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother which you ought to be
p00756_B,00756,B,i will be mr harthouse
p00757_B,00757,B,no time like the present tom begin at once
p00758_B,00758,B,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p00759_B,00759,B,having made which bargain tom we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner time
p00760_B,00760,B,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p00761_B,00761,B,so much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for so much the less so much the less
p00762_B,00762,B,heard what
p00763_B,00763,B,then you haven t heard
p00764_B,00764,B,i have heard you and so has this brute i have heard nothing else
p00765_B,00765,B,the bank s robbed
p00766_B,00766,B,you don t mean it
p00767_B,00767,B,robbed last night sir robbed in an extraordinary manner robbed with a false key
p00768_B,00768,B,of much
p00769_B,00769,B,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00770_B,00770,B,of how much
p00771_B,00771,B,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00772_B,00772,B,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00773_B,00773,B,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00774_B,00774,B,i suppose it might
p00775_B,00775,B,suppose it might by the lord you may suppose so by george it might have been twice twenty there s no knowing what it would have been or wouldn t have been as it was but for the fellows being disturbed
p00776_B,00776,B,i have already had the honour
p00777_B,00777,B,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00778_B,00778,B,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00779_B,00779,B,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00780_B,00780,B,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00781_B,00781,B,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00782_B,00782,B,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00783_B,00783,B,where is tom by the by
p00784_B,00784,B,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00785_B,00785,B,is anybody suspected
p00786_B,00786,B,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00787_B,00787,B,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00788_B,00788,B,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00789_B,00789,B,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00790_B,00790,B,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00791_B,00791,B,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00792_B,00792,B,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00793_B,00793,B,suspicious certainly
p00794_B,00794,B,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00795_B,00795,B,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00796_B,00796,B,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00797_B,00797,B,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00798_B,00798,B,but it is my duty to remember that what i was i am no longer indeed if i could altogether cancel the remembrance that mr sparsit was a powler or that i myself am related to the scadgers family or if i could even revoke the fact and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions i would gladly do so i should think it under existing circumstances right to do so
p00799_B,00799,B,i haven t played backgammon ma am since that time
p00800_B,00800,B,no sir i am aware that you have not i remember that miss gradgrind takes no interest in the game but i shall be happy sir if you will condescend
p00801_B,00801,B,what s the matter ma am you don t see a fire do you
p00802_B,00802,B,oh dear no sir i was thinking of the dew
p00803_B,00803,B,what have you got to do with the dew ma am
p00804_B,00804,B,it s not myself sir i am fearful of miss gradgrind s taking cold
p00805_B,00805,B,she never takes cold
p00806_B,00806,B,really sir oh sir not your sherry warm with lemon peel and nutmeg
p00807_B,00807,B,why i have got out of the habit of taking it now ma am
p00808_B,00808,B,the more s the pity sir you are losing all your good old habits cheer up sir if miss gradgrind will permit me i will offer to make it for you as i have often done
p00809_B,00809,B,tom have you anything to tell me if ever you loved me in your life and have anything concealed from every one besides tell it to me
p00810_B,00810,B,i don t know what you mean loo you have been dreaming
p00811_B,00811,B,my dear brother is there nothing that you have to tell me is there nothing you can tell me if you will you can tell me nothing that will change me o tom tell me the truth
p00812_B,00812,B,i don t know what you mean loo
p00813_B,00813,B,as you lie here alone my dear in the melancholy night so you must lie somewhere one night when even i if i am living then shall have left you as i am here beside you barefoot unclothed undistinguishable in darkness so must i lie through all the night of my decay until i am dust in the name of that time tom tell me the truth now
p00814_B,00814,B,what is it you want to know
p00815_B,00815,B,you may be certain that i will not reproach you you may be certain that i will be compassionate and true to you you may be certain that i will save you at whatever cost o tom have you nothing to tell me whisper very softly say only and i shall understand you not a word tom
p00816_B,00816,B,how can i say yes or how can i say no when i don t know what you mean loo you are a brave kind girl worthy i begin to think of a better brother than i am but i have nothing more to say go to bed go to bed

p00820_B,00820,B,only those you have heard of from him
p00821_B,00821,B,tom have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people and that we saw those three together
p00822_B,00822,B,no didn t you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with you
p00823_B,00823,B,yes but i did not know then what was going to happen
p00824_B,00824,B,nor i neither how could i
p00825_B,00825,B,ought i to say after what has happened that i made that visit should i say so must i say so
p00826_B,00826,B,good heavens loo you are not in the habit of asking my advice say what you like if you keep it to yourself i shall keep it to my self if you disclose it there s an end of it
p00827_B,00827,B,tom do you believe the man i gave the money to is really implicated in this crime
p00828_B,00828,B,i don t know i don t see why he shouldn t be
p00829_B,00829,B,he seemed to me an honest man
p00830_B,00830,B,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is
p00831_B,00831,B,was he offended by what you said
p00832_B,00832,B,no he took it pretty well he was civil enough where are you loo good night my dear good night
p00833_B,00833,B,you have nothing more to tell me
p00834_B,00834,B,no what should i have you wouldn t have me tell you a lie
p00835_B,00835,B,i wouldn t have you do that to night tom of all the nights in your life many and much happier as i hope they will be
p00836_B,00836,B,thank you my dear loo i am so tired that i am sure i wonder i don t say anything to get to sleep go to bed go to bed
p00837_B,00837,B,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00838_B,00838,B,we live in a singular world sir
p00839_B,00839,B,i have had the honour by a coincidence of which i am proud to have made a remark similar in effect though not so epigrammatically expressed
p00840_B,00840,B,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00841_B,00841,B,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00842_B,00842,B,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00843_B,00843,B,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00844_B,00844,B,very engaging sir
p00845_B,00845,B,highly so
p00846_B,00846,B,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00847_B,00847,B,if i waited to be taken care of by my wife ma am i believe you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday so i ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot
p00848_B,00848,B,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00849_B,00849,B,you may set your mind at rest ma am you can take it very quietly can t you loo
p00850_B,00850,B,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00851_B,00851,B,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time

p00867_B,00867,B,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything

p00869_B,00869,B,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00870_B,00870,B,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00871_B,00871,B,but there is something not an ology at all that your father has missed or forgotten louisa i don t know what it is i have often sat with sissy near me and thought about it i shall never get its name now but your father may it makes me restless i want to write to him to find out for god s sake what it is give me a pen give me a pen
p00872_B,00872,B,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00873_B,00873,B,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am

p00876_B,00876,B,no indeed sir
p00877_B,00877,B,in a similar manner ma am i can wait you know if romulus and remus could wait josiah bounderby can wait they were better off in their youth than i was however they had a she wolf for a nurse i had only a she wolf for a grandmother she didn t give any milk ma am she gave bruises she was a regular alderney at that
p00878_B,00878,B,ah
p00879_B,00879,B,no ma am i have not heard anything more about it it s in hand though and young tom who rather sticks to business at present something new for him he hadn t the schooling i had is helping my injunction is keep it quiet and let it seem to blow over do what you like under the rose but don t give a sign of what you re about or half a hundred of em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted out of reach for good keep it quiet and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little and we shall have em
p00880_B,00880,B,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00881_B,00881,B,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00882_B,00882,B,if not quite
p00883_B,00883,B,oh perfectly
p00884_B,00884,B,his face and his manner and what he said
p00885_B,00885,B,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00886_B,00886,B,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00887_B,00887,B,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00888_B,00888,B,no certainly
p00889_B,00889,B,nor of any other such person
p00890_B,00890,B,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00891_B,00891,B,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00892_B,00892,B,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00893_B,00893,B,i only say what is reasonable nothing worse i have talked it over with my friend tom more than once of course i remain on terms of perfect confidence with tom and he is quite of my opinion and i am quite of his will you walk
p00894_B,00894,B,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00895_B,00895,B,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00896_B,00896,B,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00897_B,00897,B,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00898_B,00898,B,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again

p00905_B,00905,B,he is shooting in yorkshire sent loo a basket half as big as a church yesterday
p00906_B,00906,B,the kind of gentleman now whom one might wager to be a good shot
p00907_B,00907,B,crack
p00908_B,00908,B,mr harthouse is a great favourite of mine as indeed he is of most people may we expect to see him again shortly mr tom
p00909_B,00909,B,why i expect to see him to morrow
p00910_B,00910,B,good news
p00911_B,00911,B,i have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here and i am going to dine with him afterwards i believe he is not coming down to the country house for a week or so being due somewhere else at least he says so but i shouldn t wonder if he was to stop here over sunday and stray that way
p00912_B,00912,B,which reminds me would you remember a message to your sister mr tom if i was to charge you with one
p00913_B,00913,B,well i ll try if it isn t a long un
p00914_B,00914,B,it is merely my respectful compliments and i fear i may not trouble her with my society this week being still a little nervous and better perhaps by my poor self
p00915_B,00915,B,oh if that s all it wouldn t much matter even if i was to forget it for loo s not likely to think of you unless she sees you well mrs sparsit i must be off
p00916_B,00916,B,this is a device to keep him out of the way harthouse is with his sister now
p00917_B,00917,B,not here
p00918_B,00918,B,where louisa
p00919_B,00919,B,not here
p00920_B,00920,B,but we have so little time to make so much of and i have come so far and am altogether so devoted and distracted there never was a slave at once so devoted and ill used by his mistress to look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life and to be received in your frozen manner is heart rending
p00921_B,00921,B,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00922_B,00922,B,but we must meet my dear louisa where shall we meet shall i ride up to the house a few minutes hence innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me
p00923_B,00923,B,no
p00924_B,00924,B,your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed though i am the most unfortunate fellow in the world i believe to have been insensible to all other women and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the most beautiful and the most engaging and the most imperious my dearest louisa i cannot go myself or let you go in this hard abuse of your power
p00925_B,00925,B,father i want to speak to you
p00926_B,00926,B,what is the matter how strange you look and good heaven have you come here exposed to this storm
p00927_B,00927,B,yes
p00928_B,00928,B,what is it i conjure you louisa tell me what is the matter
p00929_B,00929,B,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00930_B,00930,B,yes louisa
p00931_B,00931,B,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00932_B,00932,B,curse the hour curse the hour
p00933_B,00933,B,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00934_B,00934,B,yes louisa
p00935_B,00935,B,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00936_B,00936,B,no no my poor child
p00937_B,00937,B,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00938_B,00938,B,o no no no louisa
p00939_B,00939,B,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00940_B,00940,B,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00941_B,00941,B,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00942_B,00942,B,and you so young louisa
p00943_B,00943,B,and i so young in this condition father for i show you now without fear or favour the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know it you proposed my husband to me i took him i never made a pretence to him or you that i loved him i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom i made that wild escape into something visionary and have slowly found out how wild it was but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him it matters little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors when i was irrevocably married there rose up into rebellion against the tie the old strife made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me father until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul
p00944_B,00944,B,louisa
p00945_B,00945,B,i do not reproach you father i make no complaint i am here with another object
p00946_B,00946,B,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00947_B,00947,B,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00948_B,00948,B,for you louisa
p00949_B,00949,B,i say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence it matters very little how he gained it father he did gain it what you know of the story of my marriage he soon knew just as well i have done no worse i have not disgraced you but if you ask me whether i have loved him or do love him i tell you plainly father that it may be so i don t know this night my husband being away he has been with me declaring himself my lover this minute he expects me for i could release myself of his presence by no other means i do not know that i am sorry i do not know that i am ashamed i do not know that i am degraded in my own esteem all that i know is your philosophy and your teaching will not save me now father you have brought me to this save me by some other means i shall die if you hold me let me fall upon the ground
p00950_B,00950,B,last night louisa
p00951_B,00951,B,who brought me here
p00952_B,00952,B,sissy i believe
p00953_B,00953,B,why do you believe so
p00954_B,00954,B,because i found her here this morning she didn t come to my bedside to wake me as she always does and i went to look for her she was not in her own room either and i went looking for her all over the house until i found her here taking care of you and cooling your head will you see father sissy said i was to tell him when you woke
p00955_B,00955,B,what a beaming face you have jane
p00956_B,00956,B,have i i am very glad you think so i am sure it must be sissy s doing
p00957_B,00957,B,you can tell father if you will it was you who made my room so cheerful and gave it this look of welcome
p00958_B,00958,B,oh no louisa it was done before i came it was
p00959_B,00959,B,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00960_B,00960,B,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00961_B,00961,B,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00962_B,00962,B,o my child my child i am an unhappy man to see you thus what avails it to me that you do not reproach me if i so bitterly reproach myself louisa i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house by mere love and gratitude that what the head had left undone and could not do the heart may have been doing silently can it be so i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear
p00963_B,00963,B,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00964_B,00964,B,am i i would be something to you if i might
p00965_B,00965,B,what
p00966_B,00966,B,whatever you want most if i could be that at all events i would like to try to be as near it as i can and however far off that may be i will never tire of trying will you let me
p00967_B,00967,B,my father sent you to ask me
p00968_B,00968,B,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00969_B,00969,B,at least what
p00970_B,00970,B,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00971_B,00971,B,have i always hated you so much
p00972_B,00972,B,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try
p00973_B,00973,B,first sissy do you know what i am i am so proud and so hardened so confused and troubled so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself that everything is stormy dark and wicked to me does not that repel you
p00974_B,00974,B,no
p00975_B,00975,B,i am so unhappy and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste that if i had been bereft of sense to this hour and instead of being as learned as you think me had to begin to acquire the simplest truths i could not want a guide to peace contentment honour all the good of which i am quite devoid more abjectly than i do does not that repel you
p00976_B,00976,B,no
p00977_B,00977,B,forgive me pity me help me have compassion on my great need and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart
p00978_B,00978,B,o lay it here lay it here my dear
p00979_B,00979,B,where were you last night tom
p00980_B,00980,B,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p00981_B,00981,B,i was prevented from coming detained
p00982_B,00982,B,detained two of us were detained i was detained looking for you till i lost every train but the mail it would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night and have to walk home through a pond i was obliged to sleep in town after all
p00983_B,00983,B,where
p00984_B,00984,B,where why in my own bed at bounderby s
p00985_B,00985,B,did you see your sister
p00986_B,00986,B,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off
p00987_B,00987,B,so whether i am waiting for a hostile message or an assignation or a penitent remonstrance or an impromptu wrestle with my friend bounderby in the lancashire manner which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs i ll dine bounderby has the advantage in point of weight and if anything of a british nature is to come off between us it may be as well to be in training some dinner at six with a beefsteak in it
p00988_B,00988,B,outside where
p00989_B,00989,B,outside this door sir
p00990_B,00990,B,to mr harthouse and you speak to him with the most confiding eyes i ever saw and the most earnest voice though so quiet i ever heard
p00991_B,00991,B,you may i assure you
p00992_B,00992,B,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p00993_B,00993,B,i left her within an hour
p00994_B,00994,B,at
p00995_B,00995,B,at her father s
p00996_B,00996,B,then i certainly do not see where we are going
p00997_B,00997,B,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p00998_B,00998,B,i have no charge from her
p00999_B,00999,B,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p01000_B,01000,B,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p01001_B,01001,B,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p01002_B,01002,B,it is still true there is no hope
p01003_B,01003,B,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p01004_B,01004,B,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p01005_B,01005,B,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned
p01006_B,01006,B,yes
p01007_B,01007,B,will you oblige me by confiding it
p01008_B,01008,B,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p01009_B,01009,B,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p01010_B,01010,B,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p01011_B,01011,B,upon my soul i don t know what to say so immensely absurd
p01012_B,01012,B,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p01013_B,01013,B,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p01014_B,01014,B,my name
p01015_B,01015,B,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p01016_B,01016,B,sissy jupe
p01017_B,01017,B,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p01018_B,01018,B,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p01019_B,01019,B,it wanted this to complete the defeat the defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished only a poor girl only a stroller only james harthouse made nothing of only james harthouse a great pyramid of failure
p01020_B,01020,B,gone to bed sir
p01021_B,01021,B,tell him to get up and pack up
p01022_B,01022,B,you have missed my letter
p01023_B,01023,B,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p01024_B,01024,B,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p01025_B,01025,B,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse
p01026_B,01026,B,indeed
p01027_B,01027,B,ah indeed and in that conversation
p01028_B,01028,B,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p01029_B,01029,B,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p01030_B,01030,B,undoubtedly she is here
p01031_B,01031,B,here
p01032_B,01032,B,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p01033_B,01033,B,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p01034_B,01034,B,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p01035_B,01035,B,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed
p01036_B,01036,B,my dear bounderby
p01037_B,01037,B,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p01038_B,01038,B,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p01039_B,01039,B,i thought you couldn t make em
p01040_B,01040,B,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p01041_B,01041,B,i never mentioned his name
p01042_B,01042,B,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p01043_B,01043,B,who do you mean by we
p01044_B,01044,B,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p01045_B,01045,B,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p01046_B,01046,B,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p01047_B,01047,B,i don t see it at all sir
p01048_B,01048,B,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p01049_B,01049,B,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p01050_B,01050,B,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p01051_B,01051,B,you d like to keep her here for a time
p01052_B,01052,B,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p01053_B,01053,B,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p01054_B,01054,B,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p01055_B,01055,B,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p01056_B,01056,B,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p01057_B,01057,B,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p01058_B,01058,B,bounderby this is unreasonable
p01059_B,01059,B,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p01060_B,01060,B,not i fear to spare me
p01061_B,01061,B,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p01062_B,01062,B,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p01063_B,01063,B,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p01064_B,01064,B,what do i mean bounderby
p01065_B,01065,B,by your visiting proposition
p01066_B,01066,B,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p01067_B,01067,B,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p01068_B,01068,B,if you put it in those terms
p01069_B,01069,B,what made you think of this
p01070_B,01070,B,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p01071_B,01071,B,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p01072_B,01072,B,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p01073_B,01073,B,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p01074_B,01074,B,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p01075_B,01075,B,i always come to a decision and whatever i do i do at once i should be surprised at tom gradgrind s addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown knowing what he knows of him if i could be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug i have given you my decision and i have got no more to say good night
p01076_B,01076,B,it is mr bounderby and your brother mr tom and a young woman who says her name is rachael and that you know her
p01077_B,01077,B,what do they want sissy dear
p01078_B,01078,B,they want to see you rachael has been crying and seems angry
p01079_B,01079,B,father i cannot refuse to see them for a reason that will explain itself shall they come in here
p01080_B,01080,B,i have
p01081_B,01081,B,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p01082_B,01082,B,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p01083_B,01083,B,why couldn t you say so young tom
p01084_B,01084,B,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p01085_B,01085,B,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p01086_B,01086,B,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p01087_B,01087,B,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p01088_B,01088,B,did you offer him a bank note
p01089_B,01089,B,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p01090_B,01090,B,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p01091_B,01091,B,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p01092_B,01092,B,i am very very sorry
p01093_B,01093,B,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p01094_B,01094,B,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p01095_B,01095,B,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p01096_B,01096,B,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01097_B,01097,B,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01098_B,01098,B,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01099_B,01099,B,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01100_B,01100,B,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01101_B,01101,B,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01102_B,01102,B,what what young lady in the name of mercy was left the poor lad to do the masters against him on one hand the men against him on the other he only wantin to work hard in peace and do what he felt right can a man have no soul of his own no mind of his own must he go wrong all through wi this side or must he go wrong all through wi that or else be hunted like a hare
p01103_B,01103,B,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p01104_B,01104,B,you need have no fear of that young lady he is sure
p01105_B,01105,B,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01106_B,01106,B,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01107_B,01107,B,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p01108_B,01108,B,good night father
p01109_B,01109,B,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p01110_B,01110,B,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p01111_B,01111,B,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p01112_B,01112,B,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p01113_B,01113,B,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p01114_B,01114,B,then i will come next night too
p01115_B,01115,B,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p01116_B,01116,B,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p01117_B,01117,B,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p01118_B,01118,B,very honest
p01119_B,01119,B,and her confidence not to be shaken i ask myself does the real culprit know of these accusations where is he who is he
p01120_B,01120,B,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01121_B,01121,B,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01122_B,01122,B,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01123_B,01123,B,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01124_B,01124,B,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01125_B,01125,B,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01126_B,01126,B,that is a dreadful thought
p01127_B,01127,B,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01128_B,01128,B,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01129_B,01129,B,but he is in none of them he has been sought for in all and he s not there
p01130_B,01130,B,true
p01131_B,01131,B,he d walk the journey in two days if he was footsore and couldn t walk i sent him in the letter he got the money to ride lest he should have none of his own to spare
p01132_B,01132,B,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01133_B,01133,B,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01134_B,01134,B,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go
p01135_B,01135,B,yes dear
p01136_B,01136,B,it s mrs pegler
p01137_B,01137,B,i should think it is fetch mr bounderby stand away everybody don t tell me i have told you twenty times coming along that i will not leave you till i have handed you over to him myself
p01138_B,01138,B,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p01139_B,01139,B,why what do you mean by this i ask you what do you mean by this mrs sparsit ma am
p01140_B,01140,B,sir
p01141_B,01141,B,why don t you mind your own business ma am how dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs
p01142_B,01142,B,my dear josiah my darling boy i am not to blame it s not my fault josiah i told this lady over and over again that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you but she would do it
p01143_B,01143,B,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p01144_B,01144,B,my own boy she threatened me that if i resisted her i should be brought by constables and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a such a fine house as this indeed indeed it is not my fault my dear noble stately boy i have always lived quiet and secret josiah my dear i have never broken the condition once i have never said i was your mother i have admired you at a distance and if i have come to town sometimes with long times between to take a proud peep at you i have done it unbeknown my love and gone away again
p01145_B,01145,B,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p01146_B,01146,B,me unnatural me inhuman to my dear boy

p01172_B,01172,B,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p01173_B,01173,B,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p01174_B,01174,B,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p01175_B,01175,B,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p01176_B,01176,B,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p01177_B,01177,B,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p01178_B,01178,B,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p01179_B,01179,B,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p01180_B,01180,B,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p01181_B,01181,B,sissy has effected it father
p01182_B,01182,B,it is always you my child

p01209_B,01209,B,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good

p01241_B,01241,B,then suppose you try ma am you can take your own time for going ma am but perhaps in the meanwhile it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind to eat her meals by herself and not to be intruded upon i really ought to apologise to you being only josiah bounderby of coketown for having stood in your light so long because i can take the opportunity of saying a word to you before you go mrs sparsit ma am i rather think you are cramped here do you know it appears to me that under my humble roof there s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people s affairs and it appears to my poor judgment
p01242_B,01242,B,pray don t name it sir if that portrait could speak sir but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others it would testify that a long period has elapsed since i first habitually addressed it as the picture of a noodle nothing that a noodle does can awaken surprise or indignation the proceedings of a noodle can only inspire contempt
