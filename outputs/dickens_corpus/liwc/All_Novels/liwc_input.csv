p00020_A,00020,A,fact fact fact
p00021_A,00021,A,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure
p00022_A,00022,A,louisa thomas in the name of wonder idleness and folly what do you do here
p00023_A,00023,A,wanted to see what it was like
p00024_A,00024,A,what it was like
p00025_A,00025,A,yes father
p00026_A,00026,A,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00027_A,00027,A,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00028_A,00028,A,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00029_A,00029,A,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00030_A,00030,A,tired of what
p00031_A,00031,A,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00032_A,00032,A,i hadn t a shoe to my foot as to a stocking i didn t know such a thing by name i passed the day in a ditch and the night in a pigsty that s the way i spent my tenth birthday not that a ditch was new to me for i was born in a ditch
p00033_A,00033,A,enough to give a baby cold
p00034_A,00034,A,well what s the matter what is young thomas in the dumps about
p00035_A,00035,A,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00036_A,00036,A,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00037_A,00037,A,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00038_A,00038,A,that s the reason
p00039_A,00039,A,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly
p00040_A,00040,A,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00041_A,00041,A,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00042_A,00042,A,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00043_A,00043,A,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00044_A,00044,A,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00045_A,00045,A,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00046_A,00046,A,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00047_A,00047,A,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00048_A,00048,A,cecilia jupe by name
p00049_A,00049,A,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00050_A,00050,A,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00051_A,00051,A,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00052_A,00052,A,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00053_A,00053,A,pray mrs gradgrind what passed
p00054_A,00054,A,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00055_A,00055,A,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00056_A,00056,A,i am much of your opinion
p00057_A,00057,A,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00058_A,00058,A,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00059_A,00059,A,it s all right now louisa it s all right young thomas you won t do so any more i ll answer for it s being all over with father well louisa that s worth a kiss isn t it
p00060_A,00060,A,you can take one mr bounderby
p00061_A,00061,A,always my pet ain t you louisa good bye louisa
p00062_A,00062,A,what are you about loo you ll rub a hole in your face
p00063_A,00063,A,halloa stop where are you going stop why are you tearing about the streets in this improper manner
p00064_A,00064,A,i was i was run after sir and i wanted to get away
p00065_A,00065,A,what do you mean boy what are you doing how dare you dash against everybody in this manner was this boy running after you jupe
p00066_A,00066,A,yes sir
p00067_A,00067,A,no i wasn t sir not till she run away from me but the horse riders never mind what they say sir they re famous for it you know the horse riders are famous for never minding what they say it s as well known in the town as please sir as the multiplication table isn t known to the horse riders
p00068_A,00068,A,he frightened me so with his cruel faces
p00069_A,00069,A,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00070_A,00070,A,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week
p00071_A,00071,A,dear no sir it s the nine oils
p00072_A,00072,A,the what
p00073_A,00073,A,the nine oils sir to rub father with
p00074_A,00074,A,then what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for
p00075_A,00075,A,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00076_A,00076,A,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00077_A,00077,A,and this is pod s end is it jupe
p00078_A,00078,A,this is it sir and if you wouldn t mind sir this is the house it s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it s only merrylegs and he only barks
p00079_A,00079,A,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00080_A,00080,A,father is not in our room sir if you wouldn t mind walking in i ll find him directly father must have gone down to the booth sir i don t know why he should go there but he must be there i ll bring him in a minute
p00081_A,00081,A,by your leaves gentlemen
p00082_A,00082,A,by your leaves gentlemen it was you i believe that were wishing to see jupe
p00083_A,00083,A,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00084_A,00084,A,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00085_A,00085,A,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00086_A,00086,A,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00087_A,00087,A,kidderminster stow that
p00088_A,00088,A,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00089_A,00089,A,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00090_A,00090,A,has what has he missed
p00091_A,00091,A,missed his tip
p00092_A,00092,A,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00093_A,00093,A,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00094_A,00094,A,oh that is tip is it
p00095_A,00095,A,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00096_A,00096,A,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00097_A,00097,A,lower yourself then oh lord if you ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to let yourself down a bit
p00098_A,00098,A,this is a very obtrusive lad
p00099_A,00099,A,we d have had a young gentleman to meet you if we had known you were coming it s a pity you don t have a bespeak being so particular you re on the tight jeff ain t you
p00100_A,00100,A,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00101_A,00101,A,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00102_A,00102,A,yes i was
p00103_A,00103,A,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00104_A,00104,A,i never saw the man in my life
p00105_A,00105,A,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00106_A,00106,A,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00107_A,00107,A,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00108_A,00108,A,why has he been so very much goosed
p00109_A,00109,A,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00110_A,00110,A,a cackler here we go again
p00111_A,00111,A,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00112_A,00112,A,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00113_A,00113,A,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now
p00114_A,00114,A,perhaps so
p00115_A,00115,A,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00116_A,00116,A,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00117_A,00117,A,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00118_A,00118,A,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00119_A,00119,A,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00120_A,00120,A,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00121_A,00121,A,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00122_A,00122,A,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00123_A,00123,A,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00124_A,00124,A,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00125_A,00125,A,well thquire ith it your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl thquire
p00126_A,00126,A,i shall have something to propose to her when she comes back
p00127_A,00127,A,glad to hear it thquire not that i want to get rid of the child any more than i want to thtand in her way i m willing to take her prentith though at her age ith late my voithe ith a little huthky thquire and not eathy heard by them ath don t know me but if you d been chilled and heated heated and chilled chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young ath often ath i have been your voithe wouldn t have lathted out thquire no more than mine
p00128_A,00128,A,i dare say not
p00129_A,00129,A,what thall it be thquire while you wait thall it be therry give it a name thquire
p00130_A,00130,A,nothing for me i thank you
p00131_A,00131,A,father hush she has come back
p00132_A,00132,A,ith an internal thame upon my thoul it ith
p00133_A,00133,A,o my dear father my good kind father where are you gone you are gone to try to do me some good i know you are gone away for my sake i am sure and how miserable and helpless you will be without me poor poor father until you come back
p00134_A,00134,A,now good people all this is wanton waste of time let the girl understand the fact let her take it from me if you like who have been run away from myself here what s your name your father has absconded deserted you and you mustn t expect to see him again as long as you live
p00135_A,00135,A,i tell you what thquire to thpeak plain to you my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort and drop it they re a very good natur d people my people but they re accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh and if you don t act upon my advithe i m damned if i don t believe they ll pith you out o winder
p00136_A,00136,A,it is of no moment whether this person is to be expected back at any time or the contrary he is gone away and there is no present expectation of his return that i believe is agreed on all hands
p00137_A,00137,A,thath agreed thquire thick to that
p00138_A,00138,A,well then i who came here to inform the father of the poor girl jupe that she could not be received at the school any more in consequence of there being practical objections into which i need not enter to the reception there of the children of persons so employed am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal i am willing to take charge of you jupe and to educate you and provide for you the only condition over and above your good behaviour i make is that you decide now at once whether to accompany me or remain here also that if you accompany me now it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present these observations comprise the whole of the case
p00139_A,00139,A,at the thame time i mutht put in my word thquire tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen if you like thethilia to be prentitht you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth emma gordon in whothe lap you re a lying at prethent would be a mother to you and joth phine would be a thithter to you i don t pretend to be of the angel breed myself and i don t thay but what when you mith d your tip you d find me cut up rough and thwear an oath or two at you but what i thay thquire ith that good tempered or bad tempered i never did a horthe a injury yet no more than thwearing at him went and that i don t expect i thall begin otherwithe at my time of life with a rider i never wath much of a cackler thquire and i have thed my thay
p00140_A,00140,A,the only observation i will make to you jupe in the way of influencing your decision is that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education and that even your father himself from what i understand appears on your behalf to have known and felt that much be sure you know your own mind jupe i say no more be sure you know your own mind
p00141_A,00141,A,when father comes back how will he ever find me if i go away
p00142_A,00142,A,you may be quite at ease you may be quite at ease jupe on that score in such a case your father i apprehend must find out mr
p00143_A,00143,A,thleary thath my name thquire not athamed of it known all over england and alwayth paythe ith way
p00144_A,00144,A,must find out mr sleary who would then let him know where you went i should have no power of keeping you against his wish and he would have no difficulty at any time in finding mr thomas gradgrind of coketown i am well known
p00145_A,00145,A,well known you re one of the thort thquire that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe but never mind that at prethent
p00146_A,00146,A,oh give me my clothes give me my clothes and let me go away before i break my heart
p00147_A,00147,A,now jupe if you are quite determined come
p00148_A,00148,A,leave the bottle my dear ith large to carry it will be of no uthe to you now give it to me
p00149_A,00149,A,no no oh no pray let me keep it for father till he comes back he will want it when he comes back he had never thought of going away when he sent me for it i must keep it for him if you please
p00150_A,00150,A,mr bounderby you are unusually slow sir with your breakfast this morning
p00151_A,00151,A,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl
p00152_A,00152,A,the girl is now waiting to know whether she is to go straight to the school or up to the lodge
p00153_A,00153,A,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00154_A,00154,A,of course she can if you wish it mr bounderby
p00155_A,00155,A,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00156_A,00156,A,indeed mr bounderby very thoughtful of you
p00157_A,00157,A,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00158_A,00158,A,are you speaking of young miss gradgrind mr bounderby
p00159_A,00159,A,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00160_A,00160,A,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00161_A,00161,A,louisa louisa louisa
p00162_A,00162,A,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00163_A,00163,A,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00164_A,00164,A,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00165_A,00165,A,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00166_A,00166,A,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00167_A,00167,A,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00168_A,00168,A,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00169_A,00169,A,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00170_A,00170,A,i do not sir deny it
p00171_A,00171,A,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00172_A,00172,A,it is true sir
p00173_A,00173,A,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00174_A,00174,A,can jupe be sent here bounderby
p00175_A,00175,A,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00176_A,00176,A,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00177_A,00177,A,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00178_A,00178,A,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00179_A,00179,A,jupe i have made up my mind to take you into my house and when you are not in attendance at the school to employ you about mrs gradgrind who is rather an invalid i have explained to miss louisa this is miss louisa the miserable but natural end of your late career and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past and is not to be referred to any more from this time you begin your history you are at present ignorant i know
p00180_A,00180,A,yes sir very
p00181_A,00181,A,i shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you of the advantages of the training you will receive you will be reclaimed and formed you have been in the habit now of reading to your father and those people i found you among i dare say
p00182_A,00182,A,only to father and merrylegs sir at least i mean to father when merrylegs was always there
p00183_A,00183,A,never mind merrylegs jupe i don t ask about him i understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father
p00184_A,00184,A,o yes sir thousands of times they were the happiest o of all the happy times we had together sir
p00185_A,00185,A,and what did you read to your father jupe
p00186_A,00186,A,about the fairies sir and the dwarf and the hunchback and the genies and about
p00187_A,00187,A,hush that is enough never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more bounderby this is a case for rigid training and i shall observe it with interest
p00188_A,00188,A,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00189_A,00189,A,louisa never wonder
p00190_A,00190,A,i am sick of my life loo i hate it altogether and i hate everybody except you
p00191_A,00191,A,you don t hate sissy tom
p00192_A,00192,A,i hate to be obliged to call her jupe and she hates me
p00193_A,00193,A,no she does not tom i am sure
p00194_A,00194,A,she must she must just hate and detest the whole set out of us they ll bother her head off i think before they have done with her already she s getting as pale as wax and as heavy as i am as to me i am a donkey that s what i am i am as obstinate as one i am more stupid than one i get as much pleasure as one and i should like to kick like one
p00195_A,00195,A,not me i hope tom
p00196_A,00196,A,no loo i wouldn t hurt you i made an exception of you at first i don t know what this jolly old jaundiced jail would be without you
p00197_A,00197,A,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00198_A,00198,A,why of course i do what s the use of talking about it
p00199_A,00199,A,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00200_A,00200,A,well no more do i i am as bad as you in that respect and i am a mule too which you re not if father was determined to make me either a prig or a mule and i am not a prig why it stands to reason i must be a mule and so i am
p00201_A,00201,A,it s a great pity it s a great pity tom it s very unfortunate for both of us
p00202_A,00202,A,oh you you are a girl loo and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does i don t miss anything in you you are the only pleasure i have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like
p00203_A,00203,A,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it
p00204_A,00204,A,i wish i could collect all the facts we hear so much about and all the figures and all the people who found them out and i wish i could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together however when i go to live with old bounderby i ll have my revenge
p00205_A,00205,A,your revenge tom
p00206_A,00206,A,i mean i ll enjoy myself a little and go about and see something and hear something i ll recompense myself for the way in which i have been brought up
p00207_A,00207,A,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00208_A,00208,A,oh i don t mind that i shall very well know how to manage and smooth old bounderby
p00209_A,00209,A,what is your great mode of smoothing and managing tom is it a secret
p00210_A,00210,A,oh if it is a secret it s not far off it s you you are his little pet you are his favourite he ll do anything for you when he says to me what i don t like i shall say to him that ll bring him about or nothing will have you gone to sleep loo
p00211_A,00211,A,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00212_A,00212,A,you seem to find more to look at in it than ever i could find another of the advantages i suppose of being a girl
p00213_A,00213,A,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00214_A,00214,A,why there s one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home
p00215_A,00215,A,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00216_A,00216,A,not but what i shall be very unwilling both to leave you loo and to leave you here but i must go you know whether i like it or not and i had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence than where i should lose it altogether don t you see
p00217_A,00217,A,yes tom
p00218_A,00218,A,except that it is a fire it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks what do you see in it not a circus
p00219_A,00219,A,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00220_A,00220,A,wondering again
p00221_A,00221,A,then i beg of you louisa to do nothing of that description for goodness sake you inconsiderate girl or i shall never hear the last of it from your father and thomas it is really shameful with my poor head continually wearing me out that a boy brought up as you have been and whose education has cost what yours has should be found encouraging his sister to wonder when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it louisa don t tell me in my state of health for unless you had been encouraged it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it
p00222_A,00222,A,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00223_A,00223,A,what is the first principle of this science
p00224_A,00224,A,it would be a fine thing to be you miss louisa
p00225_A,00225,A,do you think so
p00226_A,00226,A,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00227_A,00227,A,you might not be the better for it sissy
p00228_A,00228,A,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00229_A,00229,A,i don t know that you are more useful to my mother and more pleasant with her than i can ever be you are pleasanter to yourself than i am to my self
p00230_A,00230,A,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00231_A,00231,A,mr and mrs m choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves i suppose sissy
p00232_A,00232,A,o no they know everything
p00233_A,00233,A,tell me some of your mistakes
p00234_A,00234,A,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00235_A,00235,A,national i think it must have been
p00236_A,00236,A,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00237_A,00237,A,you had better say national as he said so
p00238_A,00238,A,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00239_A,00239,A,what did you say
p00240_A,00240,A,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00241_A,00241,A,that was a great mistake of yours
p00242_A,00242,A,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00243_A,00243,A,of course it was
p00244_A,00244,A,yes miss louisa they always remind me of stutterings and that s another of my mistakes of accidents upon the sea and i find mr m choakumchild said that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death what is the percentage and i said miss i said it was nothing
p00245_A,00245,A,nothing sissy
p00246_A,00246,A,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00247_A,00247,A,did your father know so much himself that he wished you to be well taught too sissy no one hears us and if any one did i am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question
p00248_A,00248,A,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00249_A,00249,A,your mother
p00250_A,00250,A,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00251_A,00251,A,did your father love her
p00252_A,00252,A,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00253_A,00253,A,yet he leaves you now sissy
p00254_A,00254,A,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00255_A,00255,A,tell me more about him i will never ask you again where did you live
p00256_A,00256,A,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00257_A,00257,A,to make the people laugh
p00258_A,00258,A,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00259_A,00259,A,and you were his comfort through everything
p00260_A,00260,A,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00261_A,00261,A,and he liked them
p00262_A,00262,A,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00263_A,00263,A,and your father was always kind to the last
p00264_A,00264,A,always always kinder and kinder than i can tell he was angry only one night and that was not to me but merrylegs merrylegs is his performing dog
p00265_A,00265,A,why was he angry with the dog
p00266_A,00266,A,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00267_A,00267,A,finish by telling me how your father left you sissy now that i have asked you so much tell me the end the blame if there is any blame is mine not yours
p00268_A,00268,A,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and
p00269_A,00269,A,i am asking sissy a few questions tom you have no occasion to go away but don t interrupt us for a moment tom dear
p00270_A,00270,A,oh very well only father has brought old bounderby home and i want you to come into the drawing room because if you come there s a good chance of old bounderby s asking me to dinner and if you don t there s none
p00271_A,00271,A,i ll come directly
p00272_A,00272,A,i ll wait for you to make sure
p00273_A,00273,A,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone
p00274_A,00274,A,i say look sharp for old bounderby loo
p00275_A,00275,A,there s no more to tell miss louisa i keep the nine oils ready for him and i know he will come back every letter that i see in mr gradgrind s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes for i think it comes from father or from mr sleary about father mr sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of and i trust to him to keep his word
p00276_A,00276,A,do look sharp for old bounderby loo he ll be off if you don t look sharp
p00277_A,00277,A,i beg your pardon sir for being troublesome but have you had any letter yet about me

p00325_A,00325,A,no no dunnot say that sir tan t kep up that way not that way tis kep down that way i m a weaver i were in a fact ry when a chilt but i ha gotten een to see wi and eern to year wi i read in th papers every sizes every sessions and you read too i know it with dismay how th supposed unpossibility o ever getting unchained from one another at any price on any terms brings blood upon this land and brings many common married fok to battle murder and sudden death let us ha this right understood mine s a grievous case an i want if yo will be so good t know the law that helps me
p00326_A,00326,A,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money
p00327_A,00327,A,how much might that be
p00328_A,00328,A,why you d have to go to doctors commons with a suit and you d have to go to a court of common law with a suit and you d have to go to the house of lords with a suit and you d have to get an act of parliament to enable you to marry again and it would cost you if it was a case of very plain sailing i suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound perhaps twice the money
p00329_A,00329,A,there s no other law
p00330_A,00330,A,certainly not

p00354_A,00354,A,i fear jupe that your continuance at the school any longer would be useless
p00355_A,00355,A,i am afraid it would sir
p00356_A,00356,A,i cannot disguise from you jupe that the result of your probation there has disappointed me has greatly disappointed me you have not acquired under mr and mrs m choakumchild anything like that amount of exact knowledge which i looked for you are extremely deficient in your facts your acquaintance with figures is very limited you are altogether backward and below the mark
p00357_A,00357,A,i am sorry sir but i know it is quite true yet i have tried hard sir
p00358_A,00358,A,yes yes i believe you have tried hard i have observed you and i can find no fault in that respect
p00359_A,00359,A,thank you sir i have thought sometimes that perhaps i tried to learn too much and that if i had asked to be allowed to try a little less i might have
p00360_A,00360,A,no jupe no no the course you pursued you pursued according to the system the system and there is no more to be said about it i can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers and that we began too late still as i have said already i am disappointed
p00361_A,00361,A,i wish i could have made a better acknowledgment sir of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you and of your protection of her
p00362_A,00362,A,don t shed tears don t shed tears i don t complain of you you are an affectionate earnest good young woman and and we must make that do
p00363_A,00363,A,thank you sir very much
p00364_A,00364,A,you are useful to mrs gradgrind and in a generally pervading way you are serviceable in the family also so i understand from miss louisa and indeed so i have observed myself i therefore hope that you can make yourself happy in those relations
p00365_A,00365,A,i should have nothing to wish sir if
p00366_A,00366,A,my dear louisa you are a woman
p00367_A,00367,A,yes father
p00368_A,00368,A,my dear i must speak with you alone and seriously come to me in my room after breakfast to morrow will you
p00369_A,00369,A,yes father
p00370_A,00370,A,your hands are rather cold louisa are you not well
p00371_A,00371,A,quite well father
p00372_A,00372,A,and cheerful
p00373_A,00373,A,i am as cheerful father as i usually am or usually have been
p00374_A,00374,A,are you there loo
p00375_A,00375,A,dear tom how long it is since you have been to see me
p00376_A,00376,A,why i have been otherwise engaged loo in the evenings and in the daytime old bounderby has been keeping me at it rather but i touch him up with you when he comes it too strong and so we preserve an understanding i say has father said anything particular to you to day or yesterday loo
p00377_A,00377,A,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00378_A,00378,A,then i ll tell you he s with old bounderby they are having a regular confab together up at the bank why at the bank do you think well i ll tell you again to keep mrs sparsit s ears as far off as possible i expect you are very fond of me an t you loo
p00379_A,00379,A,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00380_A,00380,A,well sister of mine when you say that you are near my thoughts we might be so much oftener together mightn t we always together almost mightn t we it would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to i know what loo it would be a splendid thing for me it would be uncommonly jolly i say loo i thought i d come and just hint to you what was going on though i supposed you d most likely guess even if you didn t know i can t stay because i m engaged to some fellows to night you won t forget how fond you are of me
p00381_A,00381,A,no dear tom i won t forget
p00382_A,00382,A,my dear louisa i prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together you have been so well trained and you do i am happy to say so much justice to the education you have received that i have perfect confidence in your good sense you are not impulsive you are not romantic you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation from that ground alone i know you will view and consider what i am going to communicate louisa my dear you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me a proposal of marriage my dear
p00383_A,00383,A,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00384_A,00384,A,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00385_A,00385,A,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00386_A,00386,A,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00387_A,00387,A,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00388_A,00388,A,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00389_A,00389,A,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00390_A,00390,A,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00391_A,00391,A,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00392_A,00392,A,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00393_A,00393,A,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00394_A,00394,A,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00395_A,00395,A,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00396_A,00396,A,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00397_A,00397,A,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00398_A,00398,A,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00399_A,00399,A,shall i marry him
p00400_A,00400,A,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00401_A,00401,A,no father i do not
p00402_A,00402,A,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00403_A,00403,A,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00404_A,00404,A,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00405_A,00405,A,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00406_A,00406,A,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00407_A,00407,A,i speak of my own life father
p00408_A,00408,A,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00409_A,00409,A,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00410_A,00410,A,how matter what matter my dear
p00411_A,00411,A,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00412_A,00412,A,certainly my dear
p00413_A,00413,A,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00414_A,00414,A,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00415_A,00415,A,none father what does it matter
p00416_A,00416,A,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00417_A,00417,A,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00418_A,00418,A,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00419_A,00419,A,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00420_A,00420,A,my dear quite true quite true
p00421_A,00421,A,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00422_A,00422,A,mrs gradgrind allow me to present to you mrs bounderby
p00423_A,00423,A,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him
p00424_A,00424,A,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00425_A,00425,A,good evening mr bounderby
p00426_A,00426,A,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00427_A,00427,A,thank you sir
p00428_A,00428,A,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00429_A,00429,A,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00430_A,00430,A,mrs sparsit ma am i am going to astonish you
p00431_A,00431,A,yes sir
p00432_A,00432,A,i am going ma am to marry tom gradgrind s daughter
p00433_A,00433,A,yes sir i hope you may be happy mr bounderby oh indeed i hope you may be happy sir
p00434_A,00434,A,i wish with all my heart sir that you may be in all respects very happy
p00435_A,00435,A,well ma am i am obliged to you i hope i shall be
p00436_A,00436,A,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00437_A,00437,A,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00438_A,00438,A,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00439_A,00439,A,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00440_A,00440,A,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00441_A,00441,A,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00442_A,00442,A,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00443_A,00443,A,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00444_A,00444,A,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00445_A,00445,A,you ll have your own private apartments and you ll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it and you ll have your maid to attend upon you and you ll have your light porter to protect you and you ll be what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable
p00446_A,00446,A,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00447_A,00447,A,ladies and gentlemen i am josiah bounderby of coketown since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness i suppose i must acknowledge the same though as you all know me and know what i am and what my extraction was you won t expect a speech from a man who when he sees a post says and when he sees a pump says and is not to be got to call a post a pump or a pump a post or either of them a toothpick if you want a speech this morning my friend and father in law tom gradgrind is a member of parliament and you know where to get it i am not your man however if i feel a little independent when i look around this table to day and reflect how little i thought of marrying tom gradgrind s daughter when i was a ragged street boy who never washed his face unless it was at a pump and that not oftener than once a fortnight i hope i may be excused so i hope you like my feeling independent if you don t i can t help it i do feel independent now i have mentioned and you have mentioned that i am this day married to tom gradgrind s daughter i am very glad to be so it has long been my wish to be so i have watched her bringing up and i believe she is worthy of me at the same time not to deceive you i believe i am worthy of her so i thank you on both our parts for the good will you have shown towards us and the best wish i can give the unmarried part of the present company is this i hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as i have found and i hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found
p00448_A,00448,A,thank you bitzer

p00453_A,00453,A,well ma am i can t say that i have heard anything particular our people are a bad lot ma am but that is no news unfortunately
p00454_A,00454,A,what are the restless wretches doing now
p00455_A,00455,A,merely going on in the old way ma am uniting and leaguing and engaging to stand by one another
p00456_A,00456,A,it is much to be regretted that the united masters allow of any such class combinations
p00457_A,00457,A,yes ma am
p00458_A,00458,A,being united themselves they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man
p00459_A,00459,A,they have done that ma am but it rather fell through ma am
p00460_A,00460,A,i do not pretend to understand these things my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere and mr sparsit as a powler being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions i only know that these people must be conquered and that it s high time it was done once for all
p00461_A,00461,A,yes ma am you couldn t put it clearer i am sure ma am
p00462_A,00462,A,has it been a busy day bitzer

p00468_A,00468,A,bitzer do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names
p00469_A,00469,A,i beg your pardon ma am it s quite true that you did object to names being used and they re always best avoided
p00470_A,00470,A,please to remember that i have a charge here i hold a trust here bitzer under mr bounderby however improbable both mr bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago that he would ever become my patron making me an annual compliment i cannot but regard him in that light from mr bounderby i have received every acknowledgment of my social station and every recognition of my family descent that i could possibly expect more far more therefore to my patron i will be scrupulously true and i do not consider i will not consider i cannot consider that i should be scrupulously true if i allowed names to be mentioned under this roof that are unfortunately most unfortunately no doubt of that connected with his no bitzer say an individual and i will hear you say mr thomas and you must excuse me
p00471_A,00471,A,with the usual exception ma am of an individual
p00472_A,00472,A,ah h
p00473_A,00473,A,an individual ma am has never been what he ought to have been since he first came into the place he is a dissipated extravagant idler he is not worth his salt ma am he wouldn t get it either if he hadn t a friend and relation at court ma am
p00474_A,00474,A,ah h
p00475_A,00475,A,i only hope ma am that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on otherwise ma am we know out of whose pocket that money comes
p00476_A,00476,A,ah h
p00477_A,00477,A,he is to be pitied ma am the last party i have alluded to is to be pitied ma am
p00478_A,00478,A,yes bitzer i have always pitied the delusion always

p00503_A,00503,A,powler family you must be very much bored here
p00504_A,00504,A,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00505_A,00505,A,very philosophical and very exemplary and laudable and
p00506_A,00506,A,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00507_A,00507,A,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00508_A,00508,A,no sir he does not
p00509_A,00509,A,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00510_A,00510,A,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00511_A,00511,A,quite an eternity i think he married gradgrind s daughter
p00512_A,00512,A,yes he had that honour
p00513_A,00513,A,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00514_A,00514,A,indeed sir is she
p00515_A,00515,A,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00516_A,00516,A,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00517_A,00517,A,i give you my honour mrs powler that i never was so astonished in my life i assure you mrs powler that the father s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity i am obliged to you of all things for correcting so absurd a mistake pray excuse my intrusion many thanks good day
p00518_A,00518,A,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00519_A,00519,A,spends a deal of money on his dress ma am
p00520_A,00520,A,it must be admitted that it s very tasteful
p00521_A,00521,A,yes ma am if that s worth the money besides which ma am he looks to me as if he gamed
p00522_A,00522,A,it s immoral to game
p00523_A,00523,A,it s ridiculous ma am because the chances are against the players
p00524_A,00524,A,if you want to bring in for any place a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech look after my brother jem for he s your man
p00525_A,00525,A,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00526_A,00526,A,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00527_A,00527,A,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00528_A,00528,A,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00529_A,00529,A,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00530_A,00530,A,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00531_A,00531,A,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00532_A,00532,A,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00533_A,00533,A,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00534_A,00534,A,you are going to devote yourself as i gather from what mr bounderby has said to the service of your country you have made up your mind to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties
p00535_A,00535,A,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00536_A,00536,A,have you none of your own
p00537_A,00537,A,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00538_A,00538,A,you are a singular politician
p00539_A,00539,A,when i was your age young tom i was punctual or i got no dinner
p00540_A,00540,A,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards
p00541_A,00541,A,never mind that now
p00542_A,00542,A,well then don t begin with me
p00543_A,00543,A,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p00544_A,00544,A,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00545_A,00545,A,no such luck sir
p00546_A,00546,A,do you smoke
p00547_A,00547,A,thank ee thank ee well mr harthouse i hope you have had about a dose of old bounderby to night
p00548_A,00548,A,a very good fellow indeed
p00549_A,00549,A,you think so don t you
p00550_A,00550,A,what a comical brother in law you are
p00551_A,00551,A,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean
p00552_A,00552,A,you are a piece of caustic tom
p00553_A,00553,A,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p00554_A,00554,A,don t mind me but take care when his wife is by you know
p00555_A,00555,A,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p00556_A,00556,A,that s the past tense tom we are in the present tense now
p00557_A,00557,A,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p00558_A,00558,A,good very quaint though you don t mean it
p00559_A,00559,A,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p00560_A,00560,A,my dear fellow what am i bound to suppose when i find two married people living in harmony and happiness
p00561_A,00561,A,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p00562_A,00562,A,very dutiful in your interesting sister
p00563_A,00563,A,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p00564_A,00564,A,it was charming tom
p00565_A,00565,A,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p00566_A,00566,A,perfectly delightful and she gets on so placidly
p00567_A,00567,A,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p00568_A,00568,A,ay ay has resources of her own
p00569_A,00569,A,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p00570_A,00570,A,formed his daughter on his own model
p00571_A,00571,A,he did though i mean to say mr harthouse that when i first left home and went to old bounderby s i was as flat as a warming pan and knew no more about life than any oyster does
p00572_A,00572,A,come tom i can hardly believe that a joke s a joke
p00573_A,00573,A,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p00574_A,00574,A,and your intelligent sister
p00575_A,00575,A,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p00576_A,00576,A,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister
p00577_A,00577,A,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no

p00595_A,00595,A,i sed as i had nowt to sen sir not as i was fearfo o openin my lips
p00596_A,00596,A,you said ah i know what you said more than that i know what you mean you see not always the same thing by the lord harry quite different things you had better tell us at once that that fellow slackbridge is not in the town stirring up the people to mutiny and that he is not a regular qualified leader of the people that is a most confounded scoundrel you had better tell us so at once you can t deceive me you want to tell us so why don t you
p00597_A,00597,A,i m as sooary as yo sir when the people s leaders is bad they taks such as offers haply tis na the sma est o their misfortuns when they can get no better

p00654_A,00654,A,the name of being troublesome
p00655_A,00655,A,then by the prejudices of his own class and by the prejudices of the other he is sacrificed alike are the two so deeply separated in this town that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them he fell into suspicion with his fellow weavers because he had made a promise not to be one of them i think it must have been to you that he made that promise might i ask you why he made it

p00682_A,00682,A,why sir i am told that nickits gave seven hundred pound for that seabeach now to be plain with you if i ever in the whole course of my life take seven looks at it at a hundred pound a look it will be as much as i shall do no by george i don t forget that i am josiah bounderby of coketown for years upon years the only pictures in my possession or that i could have got into my possession by any means unless i stole em were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot on the blacking bottles that i was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with and that i sold when they were empty for a farthing a piece and glad to get it
p00683_A,00683,A,harthouse you have a couple of horses down here bring half a dozen more if you like and we ll find room for em there s stabling in this place for a dozen horses and unless nickits is belied he kept the full number a round dozen of em sir when that man was a boy he went to westminster school went to westminster school as a king s scholar when i was principally living on garbage and sleeping in market baskets why if i wanted to keep a dozen horses which i don t for one s enough for me i couldn t bear to see em in their stalls here and think what my own lodging used to be i couldn t look at em sir and not order em out yet so things come round you see this place you know what sort of a place it is you are aware that there s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere i don t care where and here got into the middle of it like a maggot into a nut is josiah bounderby while nickits as a man came into my office and told me yesterday nickits who used to act in latin in the westminster school plays with the chief justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face is drivelling at this minute drivelling sir in a fifth floor up a narrow dark back street in antwerp
p00684_A,00684,A,pardon me the expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful tom should be so proud of it i know this is inexcusable but i am so compelled to admire
p00685_A,00685,A,being so impulsive
p00686_A,00686,A,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00687_A,00687,A,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00688_A,00688,A,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00689_A,00689,A,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00690_A,00690,A,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00691_A,00691,A,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00692_A,00692,A,allow me to be frank do you think he games at all i think he makes bets
p00693_A,00693,A,i know he does
p00694_A,00694,A,everybody does lose who bets may i hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes acquit me of impertinent curiosity my dear mrs bounderby i think tom may be gradually falling into trouble and i wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience shall i say again for his sake is that necessary candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me i will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages whether forgive my plainness whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father
p00695_A,00695,A,i do not think it likely
p00696_A,00696,A,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00697_A,00697,A,i do not think that likely either
p00698_A,00698,A,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00699_A,00699,A,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00700_A,00700,A,when i married i found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt heavily for him i mean heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets they were no sacrifice i sold them very willingly i attached no value to them they were quite worthless to me since then i have given my brother at various times what money i could spare in short what money i have had confiding in you at all on the faith of the interest you profess for him i will not do so by halves since you have been in the habit of visiting here he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds i have not been able to give it to him i have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved but i have kept these secrets until now when i trust them to your honour i have held no confidence with any one because you anticipated my reason just now
p00701_A,00701,A,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00702_A,00702,A,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00703_A,00703,A,halloa i didn t know you were here
p00704_A,00704,A,whose name tom have you been carving on the trees
p00705_A,00705,A,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p00706_A,00706,A,you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature s on the bark tom
p00707_A,00707,A,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p00708_A,00708,A,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00709_A,00709,A,mercenary who is not mercenary ask my sister
p00710_A,00710,A,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00711_A,00711,A,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it
p00712_A,00712,A,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00713_A,00713,A,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p00714_A,00714,A,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p00715_A,00715,A,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p00716_A,00716,A,my good fellow so am i
p00717_A,00717,A,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p00718_A,00718,A,tom you are inconsiderate you expect too much of your sister you have had money of her you dog you know you have
p00719_A,00719,A,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p00720_A,00720,A,but my dear tom if your sister has not got it
p00721_A,00721,A,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p00722_A,00722,A,my dear tom let me try to be your banker
p00723_A,00723,A,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p00724_A,00724,A,what is the present need tom three figures out with them say what they are
p00725_A,00725,A,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p00726_A,00726,A,and i take your offer as a great kindness as a great kindness mr harthouse
p00727_A,00727,A,well it may be of more use by and by and my good fellow if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you i may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself
p00728_A,00728,A,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p00729_A,00729,A,now you see tom every man is selfish in everything he does and i am exactly like the rest of my fellow creatures i am desperately intent on your softening towards your sister which you ought to do and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother which you ought to be
p00730_A,00730,A,i will be mr harthouse
p00731_A,00731,A,no time like the present tom begin at once
p00732_A,00732,A,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p00733_A,00733,A,having made which bargain tom we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner time
p00734_A,00734,A,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p00735_A,00735,A,harthouse have you heard
p00736_A,00736,A,heard what
p00737_A,00737,A,then you haven t heard
p00738_A,00738,A,i have heard you and so has this brute i have heard nothing else
p00739_A,00739,A,the bank s robbed
p00740_A,00740,A,you don t mean it
p00741_A,00741,A,robbed last night sir robbed in an extraordinary manner robbed with a false key
p00742_A,00742,A,of much
p00743_A,00743,A,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00744_A,00744,A,of how much
p00745_A,00745,A,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00746_A,00746,A,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00747_A,00747,A,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00748_A,00748,A,i suppose it might
p00749_A,00749,A,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit
p00750_A,00750,A,i have already had the honour
p00751_A,00751,A,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00752_A,00752,A,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00753_A,00753,A,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00754_A,00754,A,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00755_A,00755,A,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00756_A,00756,A,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00757_A,00757,A,where is tom by the by
p00758_A,00758,A,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00759_A,00759,A,is anybody suspected
p00760_A,00760,A,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00761_A,00761,A,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00762_A,00762,A,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00763_A,00763,A,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00764_A,00764,A,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00765_A,00765,A,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00766_A,00766,A,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00767_A,00767,A,suspicious certainly
p00768_A,00768,A,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00769_A,00769,A,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00770_A,00770,A,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00771_A,00771,A,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me

p00802_A,00802,A,i don t know i don t see why he shouldn t be
p00803_A,00803,A,he seemed to me an honest man
p00804_A,00804,A,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is
p00805_A,00805,A,was he offended by what you said
p00806_A,00806,A,no he took it pretty well he was civil enough where are you loo good night my dear good night

p00810_A,00810,A,it appears but yesterday sir that i had the honour of receiving you at the bank when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with mr bounderby s address
p00811_A,00811,A,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00812_A,00812,A,we live in a singular world sir
p00813_A,00813,A,i have had the honour by a coincidence of which i am proud to have made a remark similar in effect though not so epigrammatically expressed
p00814_A,00814,A,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00815_A,00815,A,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00816_A,00816,A,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00817_A,00817,A,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00818_A,00818,A,very engaging sir
p00819_A,00819,A,highly so
p00820_A,00820,A,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00821_A,00821,A,there stop where you are ma am stop where you are mrs bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble i believe
p00822_A,00822,A,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00823_A,00823,A,you may set your mind at rest ma am you can take it very quietly can t you loo
p00824_A,00824,A,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00825_A,00825,A,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time
p00826_A,00826,A,what is the matter with you what has given you offence
p00827_A,00827,A,offence do you suppose if there was any offence given me i shouldn t name it and request to have it corrected i am a straightforward man i believe i don t go beating about for side winds
p00828_A,00828,A,i suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident or too delicate i have never made that objection to you either as a child or as a woman i don t understand what you would have
p00829_A,00829,A,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00830_A,00830,A,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00831_A,00831,A,well my dear and i hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself it was all your father s doing he set his heart upon it and he ought to know
p00832_A,00832,A,i want to hear of you mother not of myself
p00833_A,00833,A,you want to hear of me my dear that s something new i am sure when anybody wants to hear of me not at all well louisa very faint and giddy
p00834_A,00834,A,are you in pain dear mother
p00835_A,00835,A,i think there s a pain somewhere in the room but i couldn t positively say that i have got it you very seldom see your sister she grows like you i wish you would look at her sissy bring her here do you see the likeness louisa
p00836_A,00836,A,yes mother i should think her like me but
p00837_A,00837,A,eh yes i always say so and that reminds me i i want to speak to you my dear sissy my good girl leave us alone a minute
p00838_A,00838,A,you were going to speak to me mother
p00839_A,00839,A,eh yes to be sure my dear you know your father is almost always away now and therefore i must write to him about it
p00840_A,00840,A,about what mother don t be troubled about what
p00841_A,00841,A,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything
p00842_A,00842,A,i can hear you mother
p00843_A,00843,A,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00844_A,00844,A,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00845_A,00845,A,i tell you what ma am you shall come down here of a saturday while the fine weather lasts and stay till monday
p00846_A,00846,A,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00847_A,00847,A,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am
p00848_A,00848,A,very true sir
p00849_A,00849,A,nor yet in a week ma am
p00850_A,00850,A,no indeed sir
p00851_A,00851,A,no ma am i have not heard anything more about it it s in hand though and young tom who rather sticks to business at present something new for him he hadn t the schooling i had is helping my injunction is keep it quiet and let it seem to blow over do what you like under the rose but don t give a sign of what you re about or half a hundred of em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted out of reach for good keep it quiet and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little and we shall have em
p00852_A,00852,A,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00853_A,00853,A,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00854_A,00854,A,you recollect the man mr harthouse
p00855_A,00855,A,oh perfectly
p00856_A,00856,A,his face and his manner and what he said
p00857_A,00857,A,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00858_A,00858,A,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00859_A,00859,A,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00860_A,00860,A,no certainly
p00861_A,00861,A,nor of any other such person
p00862_A,00862,A,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00863_A,00863,A,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00864_A,00864,A,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00865_A,00865,A,but you ll go down to morrow ma am all the same you ll go down just as if i was there it will make no difference to you
p00866_A,00866,A,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00867_A,00867,A,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00868_A,00868,A,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00869_A,00869,A,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00870_A,00870,A,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again
p00871_A,00871,A,what do you mean ma am

p00882_A,00882,A,which reminds me would you remember a message to your sister mr tom if i was to charge you with one
p00883_A,00883,A,well i ll try if it isn t a long un
p00884_A,00884,A,it is merely my respectful compliments and i fear i may not trouble her with my society this week being still a little nervous and better perhaps by my poor self
p00885_A,00885,A,oh if that s all it wouldn t much matter even if i was to forget it for loo s not likely to think of you unless she sees you well mrs sparsit i must be off

p00891_A,00891,A,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00892_A,00892,A,father i want to speak to you
p00893_A,00893,A,what is it i conjure you louisa tell me what is the matter
p00894_A,00894,A,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00895_A,00895,A,yes louisa
p00896_A,00896,A,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00897_A,00897,A,curse the hour curse the hour
p00898_A,00898,A,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00899_A,00899,A,yes louisa
p00900_A,00900,A,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00901_A,00901,A,no no my poor child
p00902_A,00902,A,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00903_A,00903,A,o no no no louisa
p00904_A,00904,A,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00905_A,00905,A,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00906_A,00906,A,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00907_A,00907,A,and you so young louisa
p00908_A,00908,A,i do not reproach you father i make no complaint i am here with another object
p00909_A,00909,A,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00910_A,00910,A,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00911_A,00911,A,for you louisa
p00912_A,00912,A,when was i brought to this room
p00913_A,00913,A,last night louisa

p00916_A,00916,A,why do you believe so
p00917_A,00917,A,because i found her here this morning she didn t come to my bedside to wake me as she always does and i went to look for her she was not in her own room either and i went looking for her all over the house until i found her here taking care of you and cooling your head will you see father sissy said i was to tell him when you woke
p00918_A,00918,A,what a beaming face you have jane
p00919_A,00919,A,have i i am very glad you think so i am sure it must be sissy s doing
p00920_A,00920,A,you can tell father if you will it was you who made my room so cheerful and gave it this look of welcome
p00921_A,00921,A,my dear louisa my poor daughter my unfortunate child it would be hopeless for me louisa to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed i have been and still am by what broke upon me last night the ground on which i stand has ceased to be solid under my feet the only support on which i leaned and the strength of which it seemed and still does seem impossible to question has given way in an instant i am stunned by these discoveries i have no selfish meaning in what i say but i find the shock of what broke upon me last night to be very heavy indeed i will not say louisa that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago it would have been better for us both better for your peace and better for mine for i am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind i had proved my my system to myself and i have rigidly administered it and i must bear the responsibility of its failures i only entreat you to believe my favourite child that i have meant to do right
p00922_A,00922,A,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00923_A,00923,A,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00924_A,00924,A,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00925_A,00925,A,i hope i have not disturbed you i have come to ask if you would let me stay with you
p00926_A,00926,A,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00927_A,00927,A,whatever you want most if i could be that at all events i would like to try to be as near it as i can and however far off that may be i will never tire of trying will you let me
p00928_A,00928,A,my father sent you to ask me
p00929_A,00929,A,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00930_A,00930,A,at least what
p00931_A,00931,A,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00932_A,00932,A,have i always hated you so much
p00933_A,00933,A,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try
p00934_A,00934,A,forgive me pity me help me have compassion on my great need and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart
p00935_A,00935,A,well i don t know she was off somewhere at daybreak this morning she s always full of mystery i hate her so i do that white chap he s always got his blinking eyes upon a fellow
p00936_A,00936,A,where were you last night tom
p00937_A,00937,A,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p00938_A,00938,A,i was prevented from coming detained
p00939_A,00939,A,where why in my own bed at bounderby s
p00940_A,00940,A,did you see your sister
p00941_A,00941,A,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off
p00942_A,00942,A,beg your pardon sir you re wanted sir if you please beg your pardon sir young lady outside sir wishes to see you
p00943_A,00943,A,outside where
p00944_A,00944,A,i speak to mr harthouse
p00945_A,00945,A,if i do not understand and i do not sir what your honour as a gentleman binds you to in other matters i am sure i may rely upon it to keep my visit secret and to keep secret what i am going to say i will rely upon it if you will tell me i may so far trust
p00946_A,00946,A,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now
p00947_A,00947,A,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p00948_A,00948,A,at her father s
p00949_A,00949,A,she hurried there last night she arrived there in great agitation and was insensible all through the night i live at her father s and was with her you may be sure sir you will never see her again as long as you live
p00950_A,00950,A,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p00951_A,00951,A,i have no charge from her
p00952_A,00952,A,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p00953_A,00953,A,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p00954_A,00954,A,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p00955_A,00955,A,it is still true there is no hope
p00956_A,00956,A,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p00957_A,00957,A,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p00958_A,00958,A,will you oblige me by confiding it
p00959_A,00959,A,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p00960_A,00960,A,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p00961_A,00961,A,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p00962_A,00962,A,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence
p00963_A,00963,A,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p00964_A,00964,A,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p00965_A,00965,A,my name
p00966_A,00966,A,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p00967_A,00967,A,sissy jupe
p00968_A,00968,A,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p00969_A,00969,A,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p00970_A,00970,A,send my fellow here
p00971_A,00971,A,gone to bed sir
p00972_A,00972,A,now tom gradgrind here s a lady here mrs sparsit you know mrs sparsit who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb
p00973_A,00973,A,you have missed my letter
p00974_A,00974,A,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p00975_A,00975,A,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p00976_A,00976,A,ah indeed and in that conversation
p00977_A,00977,A,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p00978_A,00978,A,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p00979_A,00979,A,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p00980_A,00980,A,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p00981_A,00981,A,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00982_A,00982,A,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone
p00983_A,00983,A,my dear bounderby
p00984_A,00984,A,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p00985_A,00985,A,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p00986_A,00986,A,i thought you couldn t make em
p00987_A,00987,A,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p00988_A,00988,A,i never mentioned his name
p00989_A,00989,A,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p00990_A,00990,A,who do you mean by we
p00991_A,00991,A,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p00992_A,00992,A,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p00993_A,00993,A,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p00994_A,00994,A,i don t see it at all sir
p00995_A,00995,A,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p00996_A,00996,A,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p00997_A,00997,A,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p00998_A,00998,A,you d like to keep her here for a time
p00999_A,00999,A,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p01000_A,01000,A,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p01001_A,01001,A,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p01002_A,01002,A,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p01003_A,01003,A,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p01004_A,01004,A,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p01005_A,01005,A,bounderby this is unreasonable
p01006_A,01006,A,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p01007_A,01007,A,not i fear to spare me
p01008_A,01008,A,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p01009_A,01009,A,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p01010_A,01010,A,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p01011_A,01011,A,what do i mean bounderby
p01012_A,01012,A,by your visiting proposition
p01013_A,01013,A,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p01014_A,01014,A,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p01015_A,01015,A,if you put it in those terms
p01016_A,01016,A,what made you think of this
p01017_A,01017,A,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p01018_A,01018,A,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p01019_A,01019,A,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p01020_A,01020,A,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p01021_A,01021,A,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p01022_A,01022,A,who is it
p01023_A,01023,A,it is mr bounderby and your brother mr tom and a young woman who says her name is rachael and that you know her
p01024_A,01024,A,what do they want sissy dear
p01025_A,01025,A,they want to see you rachael has been crying and seems angry
p01026_A,01026,A,you have seen me once before young lady you have seen me young lady once before
p01027_A,01027,A,i have
p01028_A,01028,A,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p01029_A,01029,A,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p01030_A,01030,A,why couldn t you say so young tom
p01031_A,01031,A,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p01032_A,01032,A,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p01033_A,01033,A,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p01034_A,01034,A,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p01035_A,01035,A,did you offer him a bank note
p01036_A,01036,A,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p01037_A,01037,A,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p01038_A,01038,A,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p01039_A,01039,A,i am very very sorry
p01040_A,01040,A,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p01041_A,01041,A,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p01042_A,01042,A,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p01043_A,01043,A,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01044_A,01044,A,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01045_A,01045,A,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01046_A,01046,A,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01047_A,01047,A,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01048_A,01048,A,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01049_A,01049,A,what what young lady in the name of mercy was left the poor lad to do the masters against him on one hand the men against him on the other he only wantin to work hard in peace and do what he felt right can a man have no soul of his own no mind of his own must he go wrong all through wi this side or must he go wrong all through wi that or else be hunted like a hare
p01050_A,01050,A,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p01051_A,01051,A,you need have no fear of that young lady he is sure
p01052_A,01052,A,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01053_A,01053,A,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01054_A,01054,A,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p01055_A,01055,A,good night father
p01056_A,01056,A,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p01057_A,01057,A,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p01058_A,01058,A,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p01059_A,01059,A,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p01060_A,01060,A,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p01061_A,01061,A,then i will come next night too
p01062_A,01062,A,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p01063_A,01063,A,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p01064_A,01064,A,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p01065_A,01065,A,very honest
p01066_A,01066,A,i misdoubt if there is as many as twenty left in all this place who have any trust in the poor dear lad now if it hadn t been mercifully brought about that i was to have you to speak to times are when i think my mind would not have kept right but i get hope and strength through you and you believe that though appearances may rise against him he will be proved clear
p01067_A,01067,A,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01068_A,01068,A,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01069_A,01069,A,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01070_A,01070,A,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01071_A,01071,A,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01072_A,01072,A,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01073_A,01073,A,that is a dreadful thought
p01074_A,01074,A,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01075_A,01075,A,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01076_A,01076,A,he d walk the journey in two days if he was footsore and couldn t walk i sent him in the letter he got the money to ride lest he should have none of his own to spare
p01077_A,01077,A,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01078_A,01078,A,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01079_A,01079,A,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go

p01082_A,01082,A,why what s the matter now mrs sparsit ma am
p01083_A,01083,A,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p01084_A,01084,A,why don t you mind your own business ma am how dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs
p01085_A,01085,A,my dear josiah my darling boy i am not to blame it s not my fault josiah i told this lady over and over again that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you but she would do it
p01086_A,01086,A,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p01087_A,01087,A,my own boy she threatened me that if i resisted her i should be brought by constables and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a such a fine house as this indeed indeed it is not my fault my dear noble stately boy i have always lived quiet and secret josiah my dear i have never broken the condition once i have never said i was your mother i have admired you at a distance and if i have come to town sometimes with long times between to take a proud peep at you i have done it unbeknown my love and gone away again
p01088_A,01088,A,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p01089_A,01089,A,me unnatural me inhuman to my dear boy
p01090_A,01090,A,dear yes dear in his self made prosperity madam i dare say not very dear however when you deserted him in his infancy and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother
p01091_A,01091,A,i deserted my josiah now lord forgive you sir for your wicked imaginations and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother who died in my arms before josiah was born may you repent of it sir and live to know better
p01092_A,01092,A,do you deny then madam that you left your son to to be brought up in the gutter
p01093_A,01093,A,josiah in the gutter no such a thing sir never for shame on you my dear boy knows and will give you to know that though he come of humble parents he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful and i ve his books at home to show it aye have i and my dear boy knows and will give you to know sir that after his beloved father died when he was eight years old his mother too could pinch a bit as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it to help him out in life and put him prentice and a steady lad he was and a kind master he had to lend him a hand and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving and i ll give you to know sir for this my dear boy won t that though his mother kept but a little village shop he never forgot her but pensioned me on thirty pound a year more than i want for i put by out of it only making the condition that i was to keep down in my own part and make no boasts about him and not trouble him and i never have except with looking at him once a year when he has never knowed it and it s right that i should keep down in my own part and i have no doubts that if i was here i should do a many unbefitting things and i am well contented and i can keep my pride in my josiah to myself and i can love for love s own sake and i am ashamed of you sir for your slanders and suspicions and i never stood here before nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no and i shouldn t be here now if it hadn t been for being brought here and for shame upon you oh for shame to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son with my son standing here to tell you so different
p01094_A,01094,A,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p01095_A,01095,A,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael

p01114_A,01114,A,dear father you have three young children left they will be different i will be different yet with heaven s help
p01115_A,01115,A,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p01116_A,01116,A,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p01117_A,01117,A,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p01118_A,01118,A,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p01119_A,01119,A,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p01120_A,01120,A,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p01121_A,01121,A,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p01122_A,01122,A,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p01123_A,01123,A,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p01124_A,01124,A,sissy has effected it father
p01125_A,01125,A,it is always you my child
p01126_A,01126,A,we had our fears before yesterday and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last night and heard what passed being close to rachael all the time i went to him when no one saw and said to him he was in a tremble before i whispered to him and he started and trembled more then and said i thought of father s old circus i have not forgotten where mr sleary goes at this time of year and i read of him in a paper only the other day i told him to hurry there and tell his name and ask mr sleary to hide him till i came he said and i saw him shrink away among the people

p01134_A,01134,A,i don t see why so many people are employed in situations of trust so many people out of so many will be dishonest i have heard you talk a hundred times of its being a law how can i help laws you have comforted others with such things father comfort yourself

p01150_A,01150,A,what motive even what motive in reason can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth and crushing his miserable father see his sister here pity us
p01151_A,01151,A,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good
p01152_A,01152,A,if this is solely a question of self interest with you
p01153_A,01153,A,i beg your pardon for interrupting you sir but i am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self interest what you must always appeal to is a person s self interest it s your only hold we are so constituted i was brought up in that catechism when i was very young sir as you are aware
p01154_A,01154,A,what sum of money will you set against your expected promotion
p01155_A,01155,A,thank you sir for hinting at the proposal but i will not set any sum against it knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative i have gone over the calculations in my mind and i find that to compound a felony even on very high terms indeed would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the bank
p01156_A,01156,A,bitzer bitzer i have but one chance left to soften you you were many years at my school if in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son i entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance
p01157_A,01157,A,i really wonder sir to find you taking a position so untenable my schooling was paid for it was a bargain and when i came away the bargain ended i don t deny that my schooling was cheap but that comes right sir i was made in the cheapest market and have to dispose of myself in the dearest pray don t do that it s of no use doing that it only worries you seem to think that i have some animosity against young mr tom whereas i have none at all i am only going on the reasonable grounds i have mentioned to take him back to coketown if he was to resist i should set up the cry of stop thief but he won t resist you may depend upon it

p01264_A,01264,A,i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr bumble
p01265_A,01265,A,you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry i say you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry
p01266_A,01266,A,think so the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble
p01267_A,01267,A,so are the coffins
p01268_A,01268,A,well well mr bumble there s no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble well seasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham
p01269_A,01269,A,well well every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable
p01270_A,01270,A,of course of course and if i don t get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you see he he he
p01271_A,01271,A,just so
p01272_A,01272,A,though i must say though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over one s calculation makes a great hole in one s profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir
p01273_A,01273,A,by the bye you don t know anybody who wants a boy do you a porochial prentis who is at present a dead weight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms
p01274_A,01274,A,gadso that s just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you know dear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble i never noticed it before
p01275_A,01275,A,yes i think it rather pretty the die is the same as the porochial seal the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on newyear s morning mr sowerberry i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight
p01276_A,01276,A,i recollect the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didn t they and they made it a special verdict i think by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had
p01277_A,01277,A,tush foolery if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk they d have enough to do
p01278_A,01278,A,very true they would indeed
p01279_A,01279,A,juries juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches
p01280_A,01280,A,so they are
p01281_A,01281,A,they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that
p01282_A,01282,A,no more they have
p01283_A,01283,A,i despise em
p01284_A,01284,A,so do i
p01285_A,01285,A,and i only wish we d a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em
p01286_A,01286,A,let em alone for that
p01287_A,01287,A,well what about the boy

p01704_A,01704,A,the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury em that is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they don t die upon the road to spite us ha ha ha we are forgetting business ma am here is your porochial stipend for the month

p01910_A,01910,A,at your service ma am shall i shut the door ma am
p01911_A,01911,A,hard weather mr bumble
p01912_A,01912,A,hard indeed ma am anti porochial weather this ma am we have given away mrs corney we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented
p01913_A,01913,A,of course not when would they be mr bumble
p01914_A,01914,A,when indeed ma am why here s one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight is he grateful ma am is he grateful not a copper farthing s worth of it what does he do ma am but ask for a few coals if it s only a pocket handkerchief full he says coals what would he do with coals toast his cheese with em and then come back for more that s the way with these people ma am give em a apron full of coals to day and they ll come back for another the day after to morrow as brazen as alabaster i never see anything like the pitch it s got to the day afore yesterday a man you have been a married woman ma am and i may mention it to you a man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseer s door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney as he wouldn t go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal my heart says the ungrateful villain what s the use of this to me you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you won t get anything else here then i ll die in the streets says the vagrant oh no you won t says our overseer
p01915_A,01915,A,ha ha that was very good so like mr grannett wasn t it well mr bumble

p01918_A,01918,A,mrs corney out of door relief properly managed properly managed ma am is the porochial safeguard the great principle of out of door relief is to give the paupers exactly what they don t want and then they get tired of coming
p01919_A,01919,A,dear me well that is a good one too
p01920_A,01920,A,yes betwixt you and me ma am that s the great principle and that s the reason why if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers you ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese that s the rule now mrs corney all over the country but however these are official secrets ma am not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves this is the port wine ma am that the board ordered for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment
p01921_A,01921,A,you ll have a very cold walk mr bumble
p01922_A,01922,A,it blows ma am enough to cut one s ears off

p01927_A,01927,A,oh yes so fond of their home too that it s quite a pleasure i m sure
p01928_A,01928,A,mrs corney ma am i mean to say this ma am that any cat or kitten that could live with you ma am and not be fond of its home must be a ass ma am
p01929_A,01929,A,oh mr bumble
p01930_A,01930,A,it s of no use disguising facts ma am i would drown it myself with pleasure

p02018_A,02018,A,change it i will change it listen to me you drab listen to me who with six words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bull s throat between my fingers now if he comes back and leaves the boy behind him if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch and do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too late
p02019_A,02019,A,what is all this
p02020_A,02020,A,what is it when the boy s worth hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the lives of and me bound too to a born devil that only wants the will and has the power to to nancy dear did you mind me dear
p02021_A,02021,A,don t worry me now fagin if bill has not done it this time he will another he has done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and when he can t he won t so no more about that
p02022_A,02022,A,regarding this boy my dear
p02023_A,02023,A,the boy must take his chance with the rest and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harm s way and out of yours that is if bill comes to no harm and if toby got clear off bill s pretty sure to be safe for bill s worth two of toby any time
p02024_A,02024,A,and about what i was saying my dear
p02025_A,02025,A,ah is that
p02026_A,02026,A,yes i have been lingering here these two hours where the devil have you been
p02027_A,02027,A,on your business my dear on your business all night
p02028_A,02028,A,oh of course well and what s come of it
p02029_A,02029,A,nothing good
p02030_A,02030,A,nothing bad i hope it s as dark as the grave make haste
p02031_A,02031,A,shut the door
p02032_A,02032,A,that wasn t my doing the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole
p02033_A,02033,A,we can say the few words we ve got to say in here my dear and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours we ll set the candle on the stairs there
p02034_A,02034,A,i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once
p02035_A,02035,A,only hear him
p02036_A,02036,A,why do you mean to say you couldn t have done it if you had chosen haven t you done it with other boys scores of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldn t you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life
p02037_A,02037,A,but not mine he might have become of use to me when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my good friend
p02038_A,02038,A,what then
p02039_A,02039,A,i saw it was not easy to train him to the business he was not like other boys in the same circumstances
p02040_A,02040,A,curse him no or he would have been a thief long ago
p02041_A,02041,A,i had no hold upon him to make him worse his hand was not in i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all
p02042_A,02042,A,that was not my doing
p02043_A,02043,A,no no my dear and i don t quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him
p02044_A,02044,A,throttle the girl
p02045_A,02045,A,why we can t afford to do that just now my dear and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden she ll care no more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if he is alive i can make him one from this time and if if it s not likely mind but if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead
p02046_A,02046,A,it s no fault of mine if he is mind that fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death i told you from the first i won t shed blood it s always found out and haunts a man besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me fire this infernal den what s that
p02047_A,02047,A,what where
p02048_A,02048,A,yonder the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath
p02049_A,02049,A,it s your fancy
p02050_A,02050,A,i ll swear i saw it it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away

p02096_A,02096,A,i shouldn t wish to appear ill mannered gentlemen mr giles ought to know
p02097_A,02097,A,certainly and whatever mr giles says it isn t our place to contradict him no no i know my sitiwation thank my stars i know my sitiwation

p02099_A,02099,A,i an t

p02103_A,02103,A,i ll tell you what it is gentlemen we re all afraid
p02104_A,02104,A,speak for yourself sir
p02105_A,02105,A,so i do it s natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am
p02106_A,02106,A,so am i only there s no call to tell a man he is so bounceably
p02107_A,02107,A,but it s wonderful what a man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i know i should if we d caught one of them rascals i know what it was it was the gate
p02108_A,02108,A,i shouldn t wonder if it was
p02109_A,02109,A,it was about half past two or i wouldn t swear that it mightn t have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes i fancied i heerd a noise heerd a noise i says at first and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct
p02110_A,02110,A,what sort of a noise
p02111_A,02111,A,a kind of a busting noise
p02112_A,02112,A,more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater
p02113_A,02113,A,i heerd it now quite apparent i says i says i tossed off the clothes got softly out of bed drew on a pair of
p02114_A,02114,A,ladies present mr giles
p02115_A,02115,A,of shoes sir seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room i says when i had woke him
p02116_A,02116,A,so you did
p02117_A,02117,A,i says
p02118_A,02118,A,was he frightened
p02119_A,02119,A,not a bit of it he was as firm ah pretty near as firm as i was
p02120_A,02120,A,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p02121_A,02121,A,you re a woman
p02122_A,02122,A,so am i
p02123_A,02123,A,here he is here s one of the thieves ma am here s a thief miss wounded miss i shot him miss and brittles held the light
p02124_A,02124,A,i m here miss don t be frightened miss i ain t much injured he didn t make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him
p02125_A,02125,A,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p02126_A,02126,A,wounded desperate miss
p02127_A,02127,A,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p02128_A,02128,A,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p02129_A,02129,A,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p02130_A,02130,A,and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he
p02131_A,02131,A,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p02132_A,02132,A,he is always slow
p02133_A,02133,A,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p02134_A,02134,A,he gets worse instead of better i think
p02135_A,02135,A,i never heard of such a thing my dear mrs maylie bless my soul in the silence of the night too i never heard of such a thing you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright why didn t you send bless me my man should have come in a minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody i m sure under such circumstances dear dear so unexpected in the silence of the night too and you miss rose i
p02136_A,02136,A,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p02137_A,02137,A,ah to be sure so there is that was your handiwork giles i understand honour eh well i don t know perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and you ve fought a duel giles gad that s true where is he show me the way i ll look in again as i come down mrs maylie that s the little window that he got in at eh well i couldn t have believed it this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie
p02138_A,02138,A,he is not in danger i hope
p02139_A,02139,A,i beg your pardon ma am but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in
p02140_A,02140,A,rose wished to see the man but i wouldn t hear of it
p02141_A,02141,A,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p02142_A,02142,A,if it be necessary certainly not
p02143_A,02143,A,now let us hear what you think of him he has not been shaved very recently but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding stop though let me first see that he is in visiting order
p02144_A,02144,A,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p02145_A,02145,A,vice takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her
p02146_A,02146,A,but at so early an age
p02147_A,02147,A,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p02148_A,02148,A,but can you oh can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society but even if he has been wicked think how young he is think that he may never have known a mother s love or the comfort of a home that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt aunt dear aunt for mercy s sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment oh as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late
p02149_A,02149,A,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p02150_A,02150,A,oh no
p02151_A,02151,A,no surely my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others what can i do to save him sir
p02152_A,02152,A,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p02153_A,02153,A,unless there is some other way of preserving the child
p02154_A,02154,A,there is no other no other take my word for it
p02155_A,02155,A,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p02156_A,02156,A,you seem to think that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to day except yourself miss rose i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present
p02157_A,02157,A,you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself
p02158_A,02158,A,well that is no very difficult matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger now i make this stipulation that i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events
p02159_A,02159,A,oh no aunt
p02160_A,02160,A,oh yes aunt is is a bargain
p02161_A,02161,A,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p02162_A,02162,A,sit still
p02163_A,02163,A,thank you sir misses wished some ale to be given out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here how is the patient to night sir
p02164_A,02164,A,so so i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles
p02165_A,02165,A,i hope you don t mean to say sir that he s going to die if i thought it i should never be happy again i wouldn t cut a boy off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county sir
p02166_A,02166,A,that s not the point mr giles are you a protestant
p02167_A,02167,A,yes sir i hope so
p02168_A,02168,A,and what are you boy
p02169_A,02169,A,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p02170_A,02170,A,then tell me this both of you both of you are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night out with it come we are prepared for you pay attention to the reply constable will you something may come of this before long it s a simple question of identity you will observe
p02171_A,02171,A,that s what it is sir
p02172_A,02172,A,here s the house broken into and a couple of men catch one moment s glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness here s a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him by doing which they place his life in great danger and swear he is the thief now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they place themselves i ask you again are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy
p02173_A,02173,A,it s the runners
p02174_A,02174,A,the what
p02175_A,02175,A,yes i sent a message up by the coachman and i only wonder they weren t here before sir
p02176_A,02176,A,you did did you then confound your slow coaches down here that s all
p02177_A,02177,A,who s that
p02178_A,02178,A,oh good evening master can i have a word or two with you in private if you please
p02179_A,02179,A,this is the lady of the house
p02180_A,02180,A,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p02181_A,02181,A,certainly not
p02182_A,02182,A,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p02183_A,02183,A,now what is this about this here boy that the servants are a talking on
p02184_A,02184,A,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p02185_A,02185,A,wery easy disposed of if it is
p02186_A,02186,A,what he says is quite correct who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didn t drop out of the clouds did he master
p02187_A,02187,A,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p02188_A,02188,A,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p02189_A,02189,A,upon my word i hardly know what to do
p02190_A,02190,A,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p02191_A,02191,A,i doubt it my dear young lady i don t think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one
p02192_A,02192,A,you believe it surely
p02193_A,02193,A,i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so but i don t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer nevertheless
p02194_A,02194,A,why not
p02195_A,02195,A,because my pretty cross examiner because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a police officer on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentleman s house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself don t you see all this
p02196_A,02196,A,i see it of course but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child
p02197_A,02197,A,no of course not bless the bright eyes of your sex they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them the more i think of it the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy s real story i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery
p02198_A,02198,A,oh what is to be done dear dear why did they send for these people
p02199_A,02199,A,why indeed i would not have had them here for the world
p02200_A,02200,A,well master this warn t a put up thing
p02201_A,02201,A,and what the devil s a put up thing
p02202_A,02202,A,we call it a put up robbery ladies when the servants is in it
p02203_A,02203,A,nobody suspected them in this case
p02204_A,02204,A,wery likely not ma am but they might have been in it for all that
p02205_A,02205,A,more likely on that wery account
p02206_A,02206,A,we find it was a town hand for the style of work is first rate
p02207_A,02207,A,wery pretty indeed it is
p02208_A,02208,A,there was two of em in it and they had a boy with em that s plain from the size of the window that s all to be said at present we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once if you please

p02221_A,02221,A,of course the lady knows that don t she always interrupting you are partner this here conkey chickweed miss kept a public house over battlebridge way and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting and badger drawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for i ve seen em off en he warn t one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window which was only a story high he was wery quick about it but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they set up a hue and cry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i don t know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house said chickweed says spyers says the poor man spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moment s notice he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars out jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed a tearing down the street full cry away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner shoots round sees a little crowd dives in says chickweed it was a remarkable occurrence but he warn t to be seen nowhere so they went back to the public house next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again at last he couldn t help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed a roaring out off he starts once more with chickweed half way down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterday s one the man s lost again this was done once or twice more till one half the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief
p02222_A,02222,A,what did jem spyers say
p02223_A,02223,A,jem spyers for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says said chickweed said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadn t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances

p02278_A,02278,A,amen to that my child

p02280_A,02280,A,she is very ill now and will be worse i am sure my dear dear rose oh what shall i do without her
p02281_A,02281,A,and consider ma am oh consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her i am sure certain quite certain that for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die heaven will never let her die so young
p02282_A,02282,A,hush you think like a child poor boy but you teach me my duty notwithstanding i had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy god s will be done i love her and he knows how well we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne it must be carried to the market town which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know here is another letter but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know i would not forward it unless i feared the worst
p02283_A,02283,A,shall it go ma am
p02284_A,02284,A,hah what the devil s this
p02285_A,02285,A,i beg your pardon sir i was in a great hurry to get home and didn t see you were coming
p02286_A,02286,A,death who would have thought it grind him to ashes he d start up from a stone coffin to come in my way
p02287_A,02287,A,i am sorry i hope i have not hurt you
p02288_A,02288,A,what of rose tell me at once i can bear it anything but suspense oh tell me in the name of heaven
p02289_A,02289,A,you must compose yourself be calm my dear ma am pray
p02290_A,02290,A,let me go in god s name my dear child she is dead she is dying
p02291_A,02291,A,here oliver what s the news miss rose master o li ver
p02292_A,02292,A,in a word better or worse
p02293_A,02293,A,better much better
p02294_A,02294,A,thank heaven you are sure
p02295_A,02295,A,quite sir the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end
p02296_A,02296,A,you are quite certain there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled
p02297_A,02297,A,i would not for the world sir indeed you may believe me mr losberne s words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come i heard him say so
p02298_A,02298,A,i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise giles i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her you can say i am coming
p02299_A,02299,A,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p02300_A,02300,A,mother why did you not write before
p02301_A,02301,A,i did but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losberne s opinion
p02302_A,02302,A,but why why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if rose had i cannot utter that word now if this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself how could i ever have know happiness again
p02303_A,02303,A,if that had been the case harry i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import
p02304_A,02304,A,and who can wonder if it be so mother or why should i say if it is it is you know it mother you must know it
p02305_A,02305,A,i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty
p02306_A,02306,A,this is unkind mother do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
p02307_A,02307,A,i think my dear son that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting above all i think that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so
p02308_A,02308,A,mother he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus
p02309_A,02309,A,you think so now harry
p02310_A,02310,A,and ever will the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little
p02311_A,02311,A,harry it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now
p02312_A,02312,A,let it rest with rose then you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way
p02313_A,02313,A,i will not but i would have you consider
p02314_A,02314,A,i have considered mother i have considered years and years i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave this place rose shall hear me
p02315_A,02315,A,she shall
p02316_A,02316,A,there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother
p02317_A,02317,A,not coldly far from it
p02318_A,02318,A,how then she has formed no other attachment
p02319_A,02319,A,no indeed you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already what i would say is this before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on rose s history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic
p02320_A,02320,A,what do you mean
p02321_A,02321,A,that i leave you to discover i must go back to her god bless you
p02322_A,02322,A,i shall see you again to night
p02323_A,02323,A,by and by when i leave rose
p02324_A,02324,A,you will tell her i am here
p02325_A,02325,A,of course
p02326_A,02326,A,and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her you will not refuse to do this mother
p02327_A,02327,A,have you shot anything particular lately giles
p02328_A,02328,A,nothing particular sir
p02329_A,02329,A,nor catching any thieves nor identifying any house breakers
p02330_A,02330,A,none at all sir
p02331_A,02331,A,well i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing admirably pray how is brittles
p02332_A,02332,A,the boy is very well sir and sends his respectful duty sir
p02333_A,02333,A,hush my dear it is he sure enough come away
p02334_A,02334,A,what direction did he take
p02335_A,02335,A,that i missed them in an instant
p02336_A,02336,A,it must have been a dream oliver
p02337_A,02337,A,who was the other
p02338_A,02338,A,the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him
p02339_A,02339,A,they took this way are you sure
p02340_A,02340,A,as i am that the men were at the window the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
p02341_A,02341,A,this is strange
p02342_A,02342,A,strange blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it
p02343_A,02343,A,a few a very few will suffice rose what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated i i ought to have left here before
p02344_A,02344,A,you should indeed forgive me for saying so but i wish you had
p02345_A,02345,A,i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming a creature a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels fluttered between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved you these were distractions almost too great to bear they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course you recovered day by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind
p02346_A,02346,A,i did not mean that i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you
p02347_A,02347,A,there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours rose my own dear rose for years for years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy s attachment and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer
p02348_A,02348,A,your behaviour has ever been kind and noble as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer
p02349_A,02349,A,it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose
p02350_A,02350,A,it is that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love look into the world think how many hearts you would be proud to gain are there confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful friend you have
p02351_A,02351,A,and your reasons rose your reasons for this decision
p02352_A,02352,A,you have a right to know them you can say nothing to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it alike to others and to myself
p02353_A,02353,A,to yourself
p02354_A,02354,A,yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world
p02355_A,02355,A,if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty
p02356_A,02356,A,they do not
p02357_A,02357,A,then you return my love say but that dear rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment
p02358_A,02358,A,if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved i could have
p02359_A,02359,A,have received this declaration very differently do not conceal that from me at least rose
p02360_A,02360,A,i could stay why should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry as we have met to day we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you
p02361_A,02361,A,another word rose your reason in your own words from your own lips let me hear it
p02362_A,02362,A,the prospect before you is a brilliant one all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life are in store for you but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place in a word there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me
p02363_A,02363,A,one word more rose dearest rose one more if i had been less less fortunate the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if i had been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth
p02364_A,02364,A,do not press me to reply the question does not arise and never will it is unfair almost unkind to urge it
p02365_A,02365,A,if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this one question
p02366_A,02366,A,then if your lot had been differently cast if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger i must leave you now indeed
p02367_A,02367,A,i ask one promise once and only once more say within a year but it may be much sooner i may speak to you again on this subject for the last time
p02368_A,02368,A,not to press me to alter my right determination it will be useless
p02369_A,02369,A,no to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it
p02370_A,02370,A,and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning eh why you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together
p02371_A,02371,A,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p02372_A,02372,A,i hope i may have good cause to do so though i confess i don t think i shall but yesterday morning you had made up your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your mother like a dutiful son to the sea side before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london and at night you urge me with great mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds too bad isn t it oliver
p02373_A,02373,A,i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir
p02374_A,02374,A,that s a fine fellow you shall come and see me when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone
p02375_A,02375,A,the great nobs under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them
p02376_A,02376,A,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p02377_A,02377,A,oliver let me speak a word with you you can write well now
p02378_A,02378,A,i hope so sir
p02379_A,02379,A,i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time i wish you would write to me say once a fort night every alternate monday to the general post office in london will you
p02380_A,02380,A,oh certainly sir i shall be proud to do it
p02381_A,02381,A,i should like to know how how my mother and miss maylie are and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether she they i mean seem happy and quite well you understand me
p02382_A,02382,A,oh quite sir quite
p02383_A,02383,A,drive on hard fast full gallop nothing short of flying will keep pace with me to day
p02384_A,02384,A,cheap you would have been dear at any price and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows that
p02385_A,02385,A,are you going to sit snoring there all day
p02386_A,02386,A,i am going to sit here as long as i think proper ma am and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative
p02387_A,02387,A,your prerogative
p02388_A,02388,A,i said the word ma am the prerogative of a man is to command
p02389_A,02389,A,and what s the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness
p02390_A,02390,A,to obey ma am your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now i wish he was poor man it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper so cry away
p02391_A,02391,A,get up and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do something desperate are you going
p02392_A,02392,A,my dear i didn t know you were here
p02393_A,02393,A,didn t know i was here what do you do here
p02394_A,02394,A,i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my dear
p02395_A,02395,A,you thought they were talking too much what business is it of yours
p02396_A,02396,A,why my dear
p02397_A,02397,A,what business is it of yours
p02398_A,02398,A,it s very true you re matron here my dear but i thought you mightn t be in the way just then
p02399_A,02399,A,i ll tell you what mr bumble we don t want any of your interference you re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don t concern you making everybody in the house laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day be off come
p02400_A,02400,A,were you looking for me when you peered in at the window
p02401_A,02401,A,not that i am aware of unless you re mr
p02402_A,02402,A,i see you were not or you have known my name you don t know it i would recommend you not to ask for it
p02403_A,02403,A,i meant no harm young man
p02404_A,02404,A,and have done none i have seen you before i think you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again you were beadle here once were you not
p02405_A,02405,A,i was porochial beadle
p02406_A,02406,A,just so it was in that character i saw you what are you now
p02407_A,02407,A,master of the workhouse master of the workhouse young man
p02408_A,02408,A,you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i doubt not don t scruple to answer freely man i know you pretty well you see
p02409_A,02409,A,i suppose a married man is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner
p02410_A,02410,A,fill this glass again let it be strong and hot you like it so i suppose
p02411_A,02411,A,not too strong
p02412_A,02412,A,you understand what that means landlord now listen to me i came down to this place to day to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind i want some information from you i don t ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is put up that to begin with carry your memory back let me see twelve years last winter
p02413_A,02413,A,it s a long time very good i ve done it
p02414_A,02414,A,and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave
p02415_A,02415,A,the lying in room i suppose
p02416_A,02416,A,yes a boy was born there
p02417_A,02417,A,a many boys
p02418_A,02418,A,a murrain on the young devils i speak of one a meek looking pale faced boy who was apprenticed down here to a coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed
p02419_A,02419,A,why you mean oliver young twist i remember him of course there wasn t a obstinater young rascal
p02420_A,02420,A,it s not of him i want to hear i ve heard enough of him it s of a woman the hag that nursed his mother where is she
p02421_A,02421,A,where is she it would be hard to tell there s no midwifery there whichever place she s gone to so i suppose she s out of employment anyway
p02422_A,02422,A,what do you mean
p02423_A,02423,A,that she died last winter
p02424_A,02424,A,how can i find her
p02425_A,02425,A,to morrow
p02426_A,02426,A,at nine in the evening at nine in the evening bring her to me there i needn t tell you to be secret it s your interest what do you want following me
p02427_A,02427,A,halloa there stand still a minute i ll be with you directly
p02428_A,02428,A,come in don t keep me here what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet
p02429_A,02429,A,we we were only cooling ourselves
p02430_A,02430,A,cooling yourselves not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hell s fire out as a man can carry about with him you won t cool yourself so easily don t think it this is the woman is it
p02431_A,02431,A,hem that is the woman
p02432_A,02432,A,you think women never can keep secrets i suppose
p02433_A,02433,A,i know they will always keep one till it s found out
p02434_A,02434,A,and what may that be
p02435_A,02435,A,of course you don t how should you hear it hear it rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it i hate the sound these fits come over me now and then and thunder sometimes brings them on don t mind me now it s all over for this once now the sooner we come to our business the better for all the woman know what it is does she he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died and that she told you something
p02436_A,02436,A,about the mother of the boy you named yes
p02437_A,02437,A,the first question is of what nature was her communication
p02438_A,02438,A,that s the second the first is what may the communication be worth
p02439_A,02439,A,who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is
p02440_A,02440,A,nobody better than you i am persuaded
p02441_A,02441,A,humph there may be money s worth to get eh
p02442_A,02442,A,perhaps there may
p02443_A,02443,A,something that was taken from her something that she wore something that
p02444_A,02444,A,you had better bid i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to what s it worth to you
p02445_A,02445,A,it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds speak out and let me know which
p02446_A,02446,A,add five pounds to the sum you have named give me five and twenty pounds in gold and i ll tell you all i know not before
p02447_A,02447,A,five and twenty pounds
p02448_A,02448,A,i spoke as plainly as i could it s not a large sum either
p02449_A,02449,A,not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when it s told and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more
p02450_A,02450,A,such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last
p02451_A,02451,A,what if i pay it for nothing
p02452_A,02452,A,you can easily take it away again i am but a woman alone here and unprotected
p02453_A,02453,A,not alone my dear nor unprotected neither i am here my dear and besides mr monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons mr monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a little run to seed as i may say but he has heerd i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my dear that i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if i m once roused i only want a little rousing that s all
p02454_A,02454,A,you are a fool and had better hold your tongue
p02455_A,02455,A,he had better have cut it out before he came if he can t speak in a lower tone so he s your husband eh
p02456_A,02456,A,he my husband
p02457_A,02457,A,i thought as much when you came in so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that there s only one will between them i m in earnest see here now gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the house top is gone let s hear your story
p02458_A,02458,A,when this woman that we called old sally died she and i were alone
p02459_A,02459,A,was there no one by no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed no one who could hear and might by possibility understand
p02460_A,02460,A,not a soul we were alone i stood alone beside the body when death came over it
p02461_A,02461,A,good go on
p02462_A,02462,A,she spoke of a young creature who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying
p02463_A,02463,A,ay blood how things come about
p02464_A,02464,A,the child was the one you named to him last night the mother this nurse had robbed
p02465_A,02465,A,in life
p02466_A,02466,A,in death she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infant s sake
p02467_A,02467,A,she sold it did she sell it where when to whom how long before
p02468_A,02468,A,as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this she fell back and died
p02469_A,02469,A,without saying more it s a lie i ll not be played with she said more i ll tear the life out of you both but i ll know what it was
p02470_A,02470,A,she didn t utter another word but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper
p02471_A,02471,A,which contained
p02472_A,02472,A,nothing it was a pawnbroker s duplicate
p02473_A,02473,A,for what
p02474_A,02474,A,in good time i ll tell you i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge
p02475_A,02475,A,where is it now
p02476_A,02476,A,there it has the word agnes engraved on the inside there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born i found out that
p02477_A,02477,A,and this is all
p02478_A,02478,A,all i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at and i want to know nothing for it s safer not but i may ask you two questions may i
p02479_A,02479,A,you may ask but whether i answer or not is another question
p02480_A,02480,A,which makes three
p02481_A,02481,A,is that what you expected to get from me
p02482_A,02482,A,it is the other question
p02483_A,02483,A,what do you propose to do with it can it be used against me
p02484_A,02484,A,never nor against me either see here but don t move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush look down don t fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game if you flung a man s body down there where would it be to morrow morning
p02485_A,02485,A,twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides
p02486_A,02486,A,there if the sea ever gives up its dead as books say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party
p02487_A,02487,A,by all means
p02488_A,02488,A,you ll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you i am not afraid of your wife

p02559_A,02559,A,what s it to be
p02560_A,02560,A,that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor
p02561_A,02561,A,i say you re coming it strong
p02562_A,02562,A,you give the message and let me hear the answer
p02563_A,02563,A,it s no good being proper in this world

p02565_A,02565,A,it s a hard matter to get to see you lady if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done you d have been sorry for it one day and not without reason either
p02566_A,02566,A,i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you do not think of that tell me why you wished to see me i am the person you inquired for
p02567_A,02567,A,oh lady lady if there was more like you there would be fewer like me there would there would

p02569_A,02569,A,let me stand lady and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late is is that door shut
p02570_A,02570,A,yes why
p02571_A,02571,A,i lady i am the infamous creature you have heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me god do not mind shrinking openly from me lady i am younger than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it the poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement
p02572_A,02572,A,what dreadful things are these
p02573_A,02573,A,thank heaven upon your knees dear lady that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness and and something worse than all as i have been from my cradle i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed
p02574_A,02574,A,i pity you it wrings my heart to hear you
p02575_A,02575,A,he knows you and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out
p02576_A,02576,A,i never heard the name
p02577_A,02577,A,then he goes by some other amongst us which i more than thought before some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monks the man i asked you about you know
p02578_A,02578,A,yes i understand
p02579_A,02579,A,that monks had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldn t make out why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
p02580_A,02580,A,for what purpose
p02581_A,02581,A,he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i did and i saw him no more till last night
p02582_A,02582,A,and what occurred then
p02583_A,02583,A,i ll tell you lady last night he came again again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were these they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now he d rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides
p02584_A,02584,A,what is all this
p02585_A,02585,A,the truth lady though it comes from my lips then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldn t he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet he says
p02586_A,02586,A,his brother
p02587_A,02587,A,those were his words and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your two legged spaniel was
p02588_A,02588,A,you do not mean to tell me that this was said in earnest
p02589_A,02589,A,he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this i must get back quickly
p02590_A,02590,A,but what can i do to what use can i turn this communication without you back why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay
p02591_A,02591,A,i wish to go back i must go back because how can i tell such things to an innocent lady like you because among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i can t leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now
p02592_A,02592,A,your having interfered in this dear boy s behalf before your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed oh do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the first the first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things
p02593_A,02593,A,lady dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late
p02594_A,02594,A,it is never too late for penitence and atonement
p02595_A,02595,A,it is i cannot leave him now i could not be his death
p02596_A,02596,A,why should you be
p02597_A,02597,A,nothing could save him if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel
p02598_A,02598,A,is it possible that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is madness
p02599_A,02599,A,i don t know what it is i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last
p02600_A,02600,A,what am i to do i should not let you depart from me thus
p02601_A,02601,A,you should lady and i know you will you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done
p02602_A,02602,A,of what use then is the communication you have made this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve
p02603_A,02603,A,you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do
p02604_A,02604,A,but where can i find you again when it is necessary i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time
p02605_A,02605,A,will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed
p02606_A,02606,A,i promise you solemnly
p02607_A,02607,A,every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve i will walk on london bridge if i am alive
p02608_A,02608,A,stay another moment think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touch is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation
p02609_A,02609,A,when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are give away your hearts love will carry you all lengths even such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us pity us lady pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering
p02610_A,02610,A,you will take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet again
p02611_A,02611,A,not a penny
p02612_A,02612,A,do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you i wish to serve you indeed
p02613_A,02613,A,you would serve me best lady if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am to night than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine
p02614_A,02614,A,what makes you look so flurried
p02615_A,02615,A,i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth
p02616_A,02616,A,i never thought you had told us anything but the truth but what is this of whom do you speak
p02617_A,02617,A,getting out of a coach and going into a house i didn t speak to him i couldn t speak to him for he didn t see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did look here here it is here s where he lives i m going there directly oh dear me dear me what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again
p02618_A,02618,A,dear me i beg your pardon young lady i imagined it was some importunate person who i beg you will excuse me be seated pray
p02619_A,02619,A,mr brownlow i believe sir
p02620_A,02620,A,that is my name this is my friend mr grimwig grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes
p02621_A,02621,A,oliver twist you knew him as
p02622_A,02622,A,do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heaven s name put me in possession of it
p02623_A,02623,A,a bad one i ll eat my head if he is not a bad one
p02624_A,02624,A,he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over
p02625_A,02625,A,i m only sixty one and as the devil s in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i don t see the application of that remark
p02626_A,02626,A,do not heed my friend miss maylie he does not mean what he says
p02627_A,02627,A,yes he does
p02628_A,02628,A,no he does not
p02629_A,02629,A,he ll eat his head if he doesn t
p02630_A,02630,A,he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does
p02631_A,02631,A,and he d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it
p02632_A,02632,A,now miss maylie to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken thank god this is great happiness to me great happiness but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie you must pardon my finding fault with you but why not have brought him
p02633_A,02633,A,he is waiting in a coach at the door
p02634_A,02634,A,at this door
p02635_A,02635,A,why you get blinder every day bedwin
p02636_A,02636,A,well that i do sir people s eyes at my time of life don t improve with age sir
p02637_A,02637,A,i could have told you that but put on your glasses and see if you can t find out what you were wanted for will you
p02638_A,02638,A,god be good to me it is my innocent boy
p02639_A,02639,A,my dear old nurse
p02640_A,02640,A,then what the devil is to be done are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver
p02641_A,02641,A,not exactly that but we must proceed gently and with great care
p02642_A,02642,A,gentleness and care i d send them one and all to
p02643_A,02643,A,never mind where but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view
p02644_A,02644,A,what object
p02645_A,02645,A,simply the discovery of oliver s parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived
p02646_A,02646,A,ah i almost forgot that
p02647_A,02647,A,you see placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about
p02648_A,02648,A,hanging a few of them at least in all probability and transporting the rest
p02649_A,02649,A,thus it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot
p02650_A,02650,A,then i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really
p02651_A,02651,A,do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray the promise shall be kept i don t think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself i should like to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves
p02652_A,02652,A,i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine
p02653_A,02653,A,we must put it to the vote who may he be
p02654_A,02654,A,that lady s son and this young lady s very old friend
p02655_A,02655,A,we stay in town of course while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains
p02656_A,02656,A,come on can t yer what a lazybones yer are charlotte
p02657_A,02657,A,it s a heavy load i can tell you
p02658_A,02658,A,heavy what are yer talking about what are yer made for oh there yer are resting again well if yer ain t enough to tire anybody s patience out i don t know what is

p02667_A,02667,A,why not
p02668_A,02668,A,when i tell yer that i don t mean to do a thing that s enough without any why or because either
p02669_A,02669,A,well you needn t be so cross
p02670_A,02670,A,a pretty thing it would be wouldn t it to go and stop at the very first public house outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on no i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest house i can set eyes on cod yer may thanks yer stars i ve got a head for if we hadn t gone at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yer d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady and serve yer right for being a fool

p02742_A,02742,A,except sometimes some people are nobody s enemies but their own yer know
p02743_A,02743,A,don t believe that when a man s his own enemy it s only because he s too much his own friend not because he s careful for everybody but himself pooh pooh there ain t such a thing in nature
p02744_A,02744,A,there oughn t to be if there is
p02745_A,02745,A,that stands to reason some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven it s neither my friend neither it s number one
p02746_A,02746,A,ha ha number one for ever
p02747_A,02747,A,in a little community like ours my dear we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people
p02748_A,02748,A,oh the devil
p02749_A,02749,A,you see we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so for instance it s your object to take care of number one meaning yourself

p02756_A,02756,A,of course it is what do yer talk about such things for
p02757_A,02757,A,only to show you my meaning clearly to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the second my number one the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at first that a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company

p02886_A,02886,A,to humour me you re considerate indeed sir to humour me well well it s no matter
p02887_A,02887,A,why for what for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place why not have let me speak to you above there where it is light and there is something stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole

p02891_A,02891,A,there is nothing unusual in that they have passed me often
p02892_A,02892,A,real ones this was not

p02894_A,02894,A,your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am to night and preached of flames and vengeance oh dear lady why ar n t those who claim to be god s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler
p02895_A,02895,A,ah a turk turns his face after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first you were not here last sunday night
p02896_A,02896,A,i couldn t come i was kept by force
p02897_A,02897,A,by whom
p02898_A,02898,A,him that i told the young lady of before
p02899_A,02899,A,you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to night i hope
p02900_A,02900,A,no it s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldn t give him a drink of laudanum before i came away
p02901_A,02901,A,did he awake before you returned
p02902_A,02902,A,no and neither he nor any of them suspect me
p02903_A,02903,A,good now listen to me
p02904_A,02904,A,i am ready
p02905_A,02905,A,this young lady has communicated to me and to some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are
p02906_A,02906,A,i am
p02907_A,02907,A,that man must be delivered up by you
p02908_A,02908,A,i will not do it i will never do it devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that
p02909_A,02909,A,tell me why
p02910_A,02910,A,for one reason for one reason that the lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and i ll not turn upon them who might any of them have turned upon me but didn t bad as they are
p02911_A,02911,A,then put monks into my hands and leave him to me to deal with
p02912_A,02912,A,what if he turns against the others
p02913_A,02913,A,i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in oliver s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free
p02914_A,02914,A,and if it is not
p02915_A,02915,A,then this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it
p02916_A,02916,A,have i the lady s promise for that
p02917_A,02917,A,you have my true and faithful pledge
p02918_A,02918,A,monks would never learn how you knew what you do
p02919_A,02919,A,never the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess
p02920_A,02920,A,i have been a liar and among liars from a little child but i will take your words he is tall and a strongly made man but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly looks over his shoulder first on one side and then on the other don t forget that for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man s that you might almost tell him by that alone his face is dark like his hair and eyes and although he can t be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds why did you start part of this i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times he was covered up in a large cloak i think that s all i can give you to know him by stay though upon his throat so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face there is
p02921_A,02921,A,a broad red mark like a burn or scald
p02922_A,02922,A,how s this you know him

p02994_A,02994,A,it is because i was your father s oldest friend young man it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely man it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters s death bed when he was yet a boy on the morning that would but heaven willed otherwise have made her my young wife it is because my seared heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and errors till he died it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently now yes edward leeford even now and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name
p02995_A,02995,A,what has the name to do with it what is the name to me
p02996_A,02996,A,nothing nothing to you but it was hers and even at this distance of time brings back to me an old man the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger i am very glad you have changed it very very
p02997_A,02997,A,this is all mighty fine but what do you want with me
p02998_A,02998,A,you have a brother a brother the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm
p02999_A,02999,A,i have no brother you know i was an only child why do you talk to me of brothers you know that as well as i
p03000_A,03000,A,attend to what i do know and you may not i shall interest you by and by i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole and most unnatural issue
p03001_A,03001,A,i don t care for hard names you know the fact and that s enough for me
p03002_A,03002,A,but i also know the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume your mother succeeded she forgot it soon but it rusted and cankered at your father s heart for years
p03003_A,03003,A,well they were separated and what of that
p03004_A,03004,A,when they had been separated for some time and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends this circumstance at least you know already
p03005_A,03005,A,not i not i
p03006_A,03006,A,your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness i speak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than eleven years old and your father but one and thirty for he was i repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth
p03007_A,03007,A,i have nothing to disclose you must talk on if you will
p03008_A,03008,A,these new friends then were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some half a year before and left him with two children there had been more but of all their family happily but two survived they were both daughters one a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or three years old
p03009_A,03009,A,what s this to me
p03010_A,03010,A,they resided in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your father was gifted as few men are he had his sister s soul and person as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him i would that it had ended there his daughter did the same the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless girl
p03011_A,03011,A,your tale is of the longest
p03012_A,03012,A,it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are often it is no uncommon case died and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefs money it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no will no will so that the whole property fell to her and you before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way he came to me
p03013_A,03013,A,i never heard of that
p03014_A,03014,A,by me i told you i should interest you before long i say by me i see that your cunning associate suppressed my name although for aught he knew it would be quite strange to your ears when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history
p03015_A,03015,A,why not
p03016_A,03016,A,denial to me is vain i shall show you that i know more than that
p03017_A,03017,A,you you can t prove anything against me i defy you to do it
p03018_A,03018,A,we shall see i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indies whither as you well know you retired upon your mother s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here i made the voyage you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where i returned your agents had no clue to your residence you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy i wearied them with new applications i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant
p03019_A,03019,A,and now you do see me what then fraud and robbery are high sounding words justified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man s brother you don t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you don t even know that
p03020_A,03020,A,i did not but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all you have a brother you know it and him there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father you repaired to the place of his birth there existed proofs proofs long suppressed of his birth and parentage those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son coward liar you who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night you whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you you who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father s heart and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind you edward leeford do you still brave me
p03021_A,03021,A,no no no
p03022_A,03022,A,every word every word that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party
p03023_A,03023,A,no no i i knew nothing of that i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me i didn t know the cause i thought it was a common quarrel
p03024_A,03024,A,it was the partial disclosure of your secrets will you disclose the whole
p03025_A,03025,A,yes i will
p03026_A,03026,A,set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses
p03027_A,03027,A,that i promise too
p03028_A,03028,A,remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it
p03029_A,03029,A,if you insist upon that i ll do that also
p03030_A,03030,A,the man will be taken he will be taken to night
p03031_A,03031,A,the murderer
p03032_A,03032,A,yes yes his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness spies are hovering about in every direction i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government to night
p03033_A,03033,A,i will give fifty more and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it where is mr maylie
p03034_A,03034,A,harry as soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them
p03035_A,03035,A,fagin what of him
p03036_A,03036,A,when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time they re sure of him

p03038_A,03038,A,yes you you will be secret with me
p03039_A,03039,A,what have you done
p03040_A,03040,A,all that i could hope to do and even more coupling the poor girl s intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friend s inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day write and appoint the evening after to morrow at seven for the meeting we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature which way have they taken
p03041_A,03041,A,i wish that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come here my fine feller
p03042_A,03042,A,why didn t you blunder head

p03044_A,03044,A,why look e young gentleman when a man keeps himself so very ex clusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it it s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency circumstanced as you are
p03045_A,03045,A,especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him that s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return
p03046_A,03046,A,when was fagin took then
p03047_A,03047,A,just at dinner time two o clock this afternoon charley and i made our lucky up the wash us chimney and bolter got into the empty water butt head downwards but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top and so they took him too

p03054_A,03054,A,you should have heard the people groan the officers fought like devils or they d have torn him away he was down once but they made a ring round him and fought their way along you should have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends i can see em now not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along amongst em i can see the people jumping up one behind another and snarling with their teeth and making at him i can see the blood upon his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore they d tear his heart out
p03055_A,03055,A,what s the meaning of this he can t be coming here i i hope not

p03081_A,03081,A,yes that is the bastard child
p03082_A,03082,A,the term you use is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world it reflects disgrace on no one living except you who use it let that pass he was born in this town
p03083_A,03083,A,in the workhouse of this town you have the story there
p03084_A,03084,A,i must have it here too
p03085_A,03085,A,listen then you his father being taken ill at rome was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with her to look after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next day when he died among the papers in his desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to yourself and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes the other a will
p03086_A,03086,A,what of the letter
p03087_A,03087,A,the letter a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery to be explained one day prevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back she was at that time within a few months of her confinement he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her prayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done before and then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted i believe he had
p03088_A,03088,A,the will the will was in the same spirit as the letter he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions one for agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and ever come of age if it were a girl it was to inherit the money unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong he did this he said to mark his confidence in the mother and his conviction only strengthened by approaching death that the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature if he were disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you for then and not till then when both children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion
p03089_A,03089,A,my mother did what a woman should have done she burnt this will the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot the girl s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate i love her for it now could add goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke
p03090_A,03090,A,years after this this man s edward leeford s mother came to me he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died inquiries were set on foot and strict searches made they were unavailing for a long time but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france
p03091_A,03091,A,there she died after a lingering illness and on her death bed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallows foot she was right he came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began
p03092_A,03092,A,the locket and ring
p03093_A,03093,A,do my hi s deceive me or is that little oliver oh o li ver if you know d how i ve been a grieving for you

p03101_A,03101,A,you shut the door the night old sally died but you couldn t shut out the sound nor stop the chinks no no no no no we heard her try to tell you what she d done and saw you take a paper from her hand and watched you too next day to the pawnbroker s shop yes and it was a locket and gold ring we found out that and saw it given you we were by oh we were by and we know more than that for she told us often long ago that the young mother had told her that feeling she should never get over it she was on her way at the time that she was taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child
p03102_A,03102,A,would you like to see the pawnbroker himself

p03106_A,03106,A,indeed it will you may make up your mind to that and think yourself well off besides
p03107_A,03107,A,it was all mrs bumble she would do it
p03108_A,03108,A,that is no excuse you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction
p03109_A,03109,A,if the law supposes that the law is a ass a idiot if that s the eye of the law the law is a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experience by experience

p03115_A,03115,A,the child when her father died in a strange place in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced the child was taken by some wretched cottagers who reared it as their own
p03116_A,03116,A,go on go on
p03117_A,03117,A,you couldn t find the spot to which these people had repaired but where friendship fails hatred will often force a way my mother found it after a year of cunning search ay and found the child
p03118_A,03118,A,she took it did she
p03119_A,03119,A,no the people were poor and began to sicken at least the man did of their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promised more which she never meant to send she didn t quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the child s unhappiness but told the history of the sister s shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or other the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the girl by chance pitied her and took her home there was some cursed spell i think against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy i lost sight of her two or three years ago and saw her no more until a few months back
p03120_A,03120,A,do you see her now

p00024_B,00024,B,yes father
p00025_B,00025,B,thomas though i have the fact before me i find it difficult to believe that you with your education and resources should have brought your sister to a scene like this
p00026_B,00026,B,i brought him father i asked him to come
p00027_B,00027,B,i am sorry to hear it i am very sorry indeed to hear it it makes thomas no better and it makes you worse louisa you thomas and you to whom the circle of the sciences is open thomas and you who may be said to be replete with facts thomas and you who have been trained to mathematical exactness thomas and you here in this degraded position i am amazed
p00028_B,00028,B,i was tired father i have been tired a long time
p00029_B,00029,B,tired of what
p00030_B,00030,B,i don t know of what of everything i think
p00031_B,00031,B,say not another word you are childish i will hear no more what would your best friends say louisa do you attach no value to their good opinion what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say what would mr bounderby say
p00032_B,00032,B,no as wet as a sop a foot of water in it
p00033_B,00033,B,cold i was born with inflammation of the lungs and of everything else i believe that was capable of inflammation for years ma am i was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen i was so sickly that i was always moaning and groaning i was so ragged and dirty that you wouldn t have touched me with a pair of tongs how i fought through it i don t know i was determined i suppose i have been a determined character in later life and i suppose i was then here i am mrs gradgrind anyhow and nobody to thank for my being here but myself my mother bolted ma am my mother left me to my grandmother and according to the best of my remembrance my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived if i got a little pair of shoes by any chance she would take em off and sell em for drink why i have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four teen glasses of liquor before breakfast she kept a chandler s shop and kept me in an egg box that was the cot of my infancy an old egg box as soon as i was big enough to run away of course i ran away then i became a young vagabond and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me they were right they had no business to do anything else i was a nuisance an incumbrance and a pest i know that very well i was to pull through it i suppose mrs gradgrind whether i was to do it or not ma am i did it i pulled through it though nobody threw me out a rope vagabond errand boy vagabond labourer porter clerk chief manager small partner josiah bounderby of coketown those are the antecedents and the culmination josiah bounderby of coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops mrs gradgrind and was first able to tell the time upon a dial plate from studying the steeple clock of st giles s church london under the direction of a drunken cripple who was a convicted thief and an incorrigible vagrant tell josiah bounderby of coketown of your district schools and your model schools and your training schools and your whole kettle of fish of schools and josiah bounderby of coketown tells you plainly all right all correct he hadn t such advantages but let us have hard headed solid fisted people the education that made him won t do for everybody he knows well such and such his education was however and you may force him to swallow boiling fat but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life
p00034_B,00034,B,we were peeping at the circus and father caught us
p00035_B,00035,B,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00036_B,00036,B,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00037_B,00037,B,that s the reason
p00038_B,00038,B,don t tell me that s the reason because it can t be nothing of the sort go and be somethingological directly
p00039_B,00039,B,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00040_B,00040,B,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00041_B,00041,B,then comes the question with his eyes on the fire in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise
p00042_B,00042,B,i ll tell you in what in idle imagination
p00043_B,00043,B,i hope not i confess however that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home
p00044_B,00044,B,in idle imagination gradgrind a very bad thing for anybody but a cursed bad thing for a girl like louisa i should ask mrs gradgrind s pardon for strong expressions but that she knows very well i am not a refined character whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed i hadn t a refined bringing up
p00045_B,00045,B,whether whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything whether louisa or thomas can have been reading anything whether in spite of all precautions any idle story book can have got into the house because in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line from the cradle upwards this is so curious so incomprehensible
p00046_B,00046,B,stop a bit you have one of those strollers children in the school
p00047_B,00047,B,cecilia jupe by name
p00048_B,00048,B,now stop a bit how did she come there
p00049_B,00049,B,why the fact is i saw the girl myself for the first time only just now she specially applied here at the house to be admitted as not regularly belonging to our town and yes you are right bounderby you are right
p00050_B,00050,B,now stop a bit louisa saw her when she came
p00051_B,00051,B,louisa certainly did see her for she mentioned the application to me but louisa saw her i have no doubt in mrs gradgrind s presence
p00052_B,00052,B,pray mrs gradgrind what passed
p00053_B,00053,B,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact
p00054_B,00054,B,now i tell you what gradgrind turn this girl to the right about and there s an end of it
p00055_B,00055,B,i am much of your opinion
p00056_B,00056,B,do it at once has always been my motto from a child when i thought i would run away from my egg box and my grandmother i did it at once do you the same do this at once
p00057_B,00057,B,are you walking i have the father s address perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me
p00058_B,00058,B,not the least in the world as long as you do it at once i never wear gloves i didn t climb up the ladder in them shouldn t be so high up if i had
p00059_B,00059,B,you can take one mr bounderby
p00060_B,00060,B,always my pet ain t you louisa good bye louisa
p00061_B,00061,B,what are you about loo you ll rub a hole in your face
p00062_B,00062,B,you may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like tom i wouldn t cry
p00063_B,00063,B,i was i was run after sir and i wanted to get away
p00064_B,00064,B,run after who would run after you
p00065_B,00065,B,yes sir

p00068_B,00068,B,oh oh an t you one of the rest an t you a horse rider i never looked at her sir i asked her if she would know how to define a horse to morrow and offered to tell her again and she ran away and i ran after her sir that she might know how to answer when she was asked you wouldn t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn t been a horse rider
p00069_B,00069,B,her calling seems to be pretty well known among em you d have had the whole school peeping in a row in a week

p00074_B,00074,B,it s what our people aways use sir when they get any hurts in the ring they bruise themselves very bad sometimes
p00075_B,00075,B,serve em right for being idle by george when i was four or five years younger than you i had worse bruises upon me than ten oils twenty oils forty oils would have rubbed off i didn t get em by posture making but by being banged about there was no rope dancing for me i danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope
p00076_B,00076,B,and this is pod s end is it jupe
p00077_B,00077,B,this is it sir and if you wouldn t mind sir this is the house it s only crossing the bar sir and up the stairs if you wouldn t mind and waiting there for a moment till i get a candle if you should hear a dog sir it s only merrylegs and he only barks
p00078_B,00078,B,merrylegs and nine oils eh pretty well this for a self made man
p00079_B,00079,B,father is not in our room sir if you wouldn t mind walking in i ll find him directly father must have gone down to the booth sir i don t know why he should go there but he must be there i ll bring him in a minute

p00082_B,00082,B,it was his daughter has gone to fetch him but i can t wait therefore if you please i will leave a message for him with you
p00083_B,00083,B,you see my friend we are the kind of people who know the value of time and you are the kind of people who don t know the value of time
p00084_B,00084,B,i have not the honour of knowing you but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than i can of mine i should judge from your appearance that you are about right
p00085_B,00085,B,and when you have made it you can keep it too i should think
p00086_B,00086,B,kidderminster stow that
p00087_B,00087,B,what does he come here cheeking us for then if you want to cheek us pay your ochre at the doors and take it out
p00088_B,00088,B,kidderminster stow that sir i was addressing myself to you you may or you may not be aware for perhaps you have not been much in the audience that jupe has missed his tip very often lately
p00089_B,00089,B,has what has he missed
p00090_B,00090,B,missed his tip
p00091_B,00091,B,offered at the garters four times last night and never done em once missed his tip at the banners too and was loose in his ponging
p00092_B,00092,B,didn t do what he ought to do was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling
p00093_B,00093,B,oh that is tip is it
p00094_B,00094,B,in a general way that s missing his tip
p00095_B,00095,B,nine oils merrylegs missing tips garters banners and ponging eh queer sort of company too for a man who has raised himself
p00096_B,00096,B,lower yourself then oh lord if you ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to let yourself down a bit
p00097_B,00097,B,this is a very obtrusive lad
p00098_B,00098,B,we d have had a young gentleman to meet you if we had known you were coming it s a pity you don t have a bespeak being so particular you re on the tight jeff ain t you
p00099_B,00099,B,what does this unmannerly boy mean by tight jeff
p00100_B,00100,B,there get out get out tight jeff or slack jeff it don t much signify it s only tight rope and slack rope you were going to give me a message for jupe
p00101_B,00101,B,yes i was
p00102_B,00102,B,then my opinion is he will never receive it do you know much of him
p00103_B,00103,B,i never saw the man in my life
p00104_B,00104,B,i doubt if you ever will see him now it s pretty plain to me he s off
p00105_B,00105,B,do you mean that he has deserted his daughter
p00106_B,00106,B,ay i mean that he has cut he was goosed last night he was goosed the night before last he was goosed to day he has lately got in the way of being always goosed and he can t stand it
p00107_B,00107,B,why has he been so very much goosed
p00108_B,00108,B,his joints are turning stiff and he is getting used up he has his points as a cackler still but he can t get a living out of them
p00109_B,00109,B,a cackler here we go again
p00110_B,00110,B,a speaker if the gentleman likes it better now it s a remarkable fact sir that it cut that man deeper to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed than to go through with it
p00111_B,00111,B,good this is good gradgrind a man so fond of his daughter that he runs away from her this is devilish good ha ha now i ll tell you what young man i haven t always occupied my present station of life i know what these things are you may be astonished to hear it but my mother ran away from me very well i was born in a ditch and my mother ran away from me do i excuse her for it no have i ever excused her for it not i what do i call her for it i call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world except my drunken grandmother there s no family pride about me there s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me i call a spade a spade and i call the mother of josiah bounderby of coketown without any fear or any favour what i should call her if she had been the mother of dick jones of wapping so with this man he is a runaway rogue and a vagabond that s what he is in english
p00112_B,00112,B,it s all the same to me what he is or what he is not whether in english or whether in french i am telling your friend what s the fact if you don t like to hear it you can avail yourself of the open air you give it mouth enough you do but give it mouth in your own building at least don t give it mouth in this building till you re called upon you have got some building of your own i dare say now
p00113_B,00113,B,perhaps so
p00114_B,00114,B,then give it mouth in your own building will you if you please because this isn t a strong building and too much of you might bring it down jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago and then was seen to slip out himself with his hat over his eyes and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm she will never believe it of him but he has cut away and left her
p00115_B,00115,B,pray why will she never believe it of him
p00116_B,00116,B,because those two were one because they were never asunder because up to this time he seemed to dote upon her poor sissy he had better have apprenticed her now he leaves her without anything to take to
p00117_B,00117,B,it is creditable to you who have never been apprenticed to express that opinion
p00118_B,00118,B,i never apprenticed i was apprenticed when i was seven year old
p00119_B,00119,B,oh indeed i was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to
p00120_B,00120,B,idleness no by the lord harry nor i
p00121_B,00121,B,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00122_B,00122,B,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00123_B,00123,B,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means
p00124_B,00124,B,but even as an example to louisa of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity leads to and ends in think of it bounderby in that point of view
p00125_B,00125,B,i shall have something to propose to her when she comes back
p00126_B,00126,B,glad to hear it thquire not that i want to get rid of the child any more than i want to thtand in her way i m willing to take her prentith though at her age ith late my voithe ith a little huthky thquire and not eathy heard by them ath don t know me but if you d been chilled and heated heated and chilled chilled and heated in the ring when you wath young ath often ath i have been your voithe wouldn t have lathted out thquire no more than mine
p00127_B,00127,B,i dare say not
p00128_B,00128,B,what thall it be thquire while you wait thall it be therry give it a name thquire
p00129_B,00129,B,nothing for me i thank you
p00130_B,00130,B,don t thay nothing thquire what doth your friend thay if you haven t took your feed yet have a glath of bitterth

p00133_B,00133,B,now good people all this is wanton waste of time let the girl understand the fact let her take it from me if you like who have been run away from myself here what s your name your father has absconded deserted you and you mustn t expect to see him again as long as you live
p00134_B,00134,B,i tell you what thquire to thpeak plain to you my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort and drop it they re a very good natur d people my people but they re accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh and if you don t act upon my advithe i m damned if i don t believe they ll pith you out o winder
p00135_B,00135,B,it is of no moment whether this person is to be expected back at any time or the contrary he is gone away and there is no present expectation of his return that i believe is agreed on all hands
p00136_B,00136,B,thath agreed thquire thick to that
p00137_B,00137,B,well then i who came here to inform the father of the poor girl jupe that she could not be received at the school any more in consequence of there being practical objections into which i need not enter to the reception there of the children of persons so employed am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal i am willing to take charge of you jupe and to educate you and provide for you the only condition over and above your good behaviour i make is that you decide now at once whether to accompany me or remain here also that if you accompany me now it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present these observations comprise the whole of the case
p00138_B,00138,B,at the thame time i mutht put in my word thquire tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen if you like thethilia to be prentitht you know the natur of the work and you know your companionth emma gordon in whothe lap you re a lying at prethent would be a mother to you and joth phine would be a thithter to you i don t pretend to be of the angel breed myself and i don t thay but what when you mith d your tip you d find me cut up rough and thwear an oath or two at you but what i thay thquire ith that good tempered or bad tempered i never did a horthe a injury yet no more than thwearing at him went and that i don t expect i thall begin otherwithe at my time of life with a rider i never wath much of a cackler thquire and i have thed my thay
p00139_B,00139,B,the only observation i will make to you jupe in the way of influencing your decision is that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education and that even your father himself from what i understand appears on your behalf to have known and felt that much be sure you know your own mind jupe i say no more be sure you know your own mind
p00140_B,00140,B,when father comes back how will he ever find me if i go away
p00141_B,00141,B,you may be quite at ease you may be quite at ease jupe on that score in such a case your father i apprehend must find out mr

p00150_B,00150,B,why ma am i am thinking about tom gradgrind s whim tom gradgrind s whim ma am of bringing up the tumbling girl
p00151_B,00151,B,the girl is now waiting to know whether she is to go straight to the school or up to the lodge
p00152_B,00152,B,she must wait ma am till i know myself we shall have tom gradgrind down here presently i suppose if he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer of course she can ma am
p00153_B,00153,B,of course she can if you wish it mr bounderby
p00154_B,00154,B,i told him i would give her a shake down here last night in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with louisa
p00155_B,00155,B,indeed mr bounderby very thoughtful of you
p00156_B,00156,B,it s tolerably clear to me that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship
p00157_B,00157,B,are you speaking of young miss gradgrind mr bounderby
p00158_B,00158,B,yes ma am i m speaking of louisa
p00159_B,00159,B,and there being two little girls in question i did not know which might be indicated by that expression your observation being limited to little puss
p00160_B,00160,B,louisa louisa louisa
p00161_B,00161,B,you are quite another father to louisa sir
p00162_B,00162,B,if you had said i was another father to tom young tom i mean not my friend tom gradgrind you might have been nearer the mark i am going to take young tom into my office going to have him under my wing ma am
p00163_B,00163,B,indeed rather young for that is he not sir
p00164_B,00164,B,i m not going to take him at once he is to finish his educational cramming before then by the lord harry he ll have enough of it first and last he d open his eyes that boy would if he knew how empty of learning my young maw was at his time of life but it s extraordinary the difficulty i have on scores of such subjects in speaking to any one on equal terms here for example i have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers why what do you know about tumblers at the time when to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets would have been a godsend to me a prize in the lottery to me you were at the italian opera you were coming out of the italian opera ma am in white satin and jewels a blaze of splendour when i hadn t a penny to buy a link to light you
p00165_B,00165,B,i certainly sir was familiar with the italian opera at a very early age
p00166_B,00166,B,egad ma am so was i with the wrong side of it a hard bed the pavement of its arcade used to make i assure you people like you ma am accustomed from infancy to lie on down feathers have no idea how hard a paving stone is without trying it no no it s of no use my talking to you about tumblers i should speak of foreign dancers and the west end of london and may fair and lords and ladies and honourables
p00167_B,00167,B,i trust sir it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind i hope i have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life if i have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences and can scarcely hear enough of them i claim no merit for that since i believe it is a general sentiment
p00168_B,00168,B,well ma am perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear in his own unpolished way what josiah bounderby of coketown has gone through but you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury yourself come ma am you know you were born in the lap of luxury
p00169_B,00169,B,i do not sir deny it
p00170_B,00170,B,and you were in crack society devilish high society
p00171_B,00171,B,it is true sir
p00172_B,00172,B,you were in the tiptop fashion and all the rest of it
p00173_B,00173,B,yes sir it is unquestionably true
p00174_B,00174,B,now i tell you what my girl the name of that lady by the teapot is mrs sparsit that lady acts as mistress of this house and she is a highly connected lady consequently if ever you come again into any room in this house you will make a short stay in it if you don t behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner now i don t care a button what you do to me because i don t affect to be anybody so far from having high connections i have no connections at all and i come of the scum of the earth but towards that lady i do care what you do and you shall do what is deferential and respectful or you shall not come here
p00175_B,00175,B,i hope bounderby that this was merely an oversight
p00176_B,00176,B,my friend tom gradgrind suggests mrs sparsit that this was merely an oversight very likely however as you are aware ma am i don t allow of even oversights towards you
p00177_B,00177,B,you are very good indeed sir it is not worth speaking of
p00178_B,00178,B,jupe i have made up my mind to take you into my house and when you are not in attendance at the school to employ you about mrs gradgrind who is rather an invalid i have explained to miss louisa this is miss louisa the miserable but natural end of your late career and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past and is not to be referred to any more from this time you begin your history you are at present ignorant i know
p00179_B,00179,B,yes sir very
p00180_B,00180,B,i shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you of the advantages of the training you will receive you will be reclaimed and formed you have been in the habit now of reading to your father and those people i found you among i dare say
p00181_B,00181,B,only to father and merrylegs sir at least i mean to father when merrylegs was always there
p00182_B,00182,B,never mind merrylegs jupe i don t ask about him i understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father
p00183_B,00183,B,o yes sir thousands of times they were the happiest o of all the happy times we had together sir
p00184_B,00184,B,and what did you read to your father jupe
p00185_B,00185,B,about the fairies sir and the dwarf and the hunchback and the genies and about
p00186_B,00186,B,hush that is enough never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more bounderby this is a case for rigid training and i shall observe it with interest
p00187_B,00187,B,well i have given you my opinion already and i shouldn t do as you do but very well very well since you are bent upon it very well
p00188_B,00188,B,tom i wonder
p00189_B,00189,B,i am sick of my life loo i hate it altogether and i hate everybody except you
p00190_B,00190,B,you don t hate sissy tom
p00191_B,00191,B,i hate to be obliged to call her jupe and she hates me
p00192_B,00192,B,no she does not tom i am sure
p00193_B,00193,B,she must she must just hate and detest the whole set out of us they ll bother her head off i think before they have done with her already she s getting as pale as wax and as heavy as i am as to me i am a donkey that s what i am i am as obstinate as one i am more stupid than one i get as much pleasure as one and i should like to kick like one
p00194_B,00194,B,not me i hope tom
p00195_B,00195,B,no loo i wouldn t hurt you i made an exception of you at first i don t know what this jolly old jaundiced jail would be without you
p00196_B,00196,B,indeed tom do you really and truly say so
p00197_B,00197,B,why of course i do what s the use of talking about it
p00198_B,00198,B,because tom as i get older and nearer growing up i often sit wondering here and think how unfortunate it is for me that i can t reconcile you to home better than i am able to do i don t know what other girls know i can t play to you or sing to you i can t talk to you so as to lighten your mind for i never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about when you are tired
p00199_B,00199,B,well no more do i i am as bad as you in that respect and i am a mule too which you re not if father was determined to make me either a prig or a mule and i am not a prig why it stands to reason i must be a mule and so i am
p00200_B,00200,B,it s a great pity it s a great pity tom it s very unfortunate for both of us
p00201_B,00201,B,oh you you are a girl loo and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does i don t miss anything in you you are the only pleasure i have you can brighten even this place and you can always lead me as you like
p00202_B,00202,B,you are a dear brother tom and while you think i can do such things i don t so much mind knowing better though i do know better tom and am very sorry for it
p00203_B,00203,B,i wish i could collect all the facts we hear so much about and all the figures and all the people who found them out and i wish i could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together however when i go to live with old bounderby i ll have my revenge
p00204_B,00204,B,your revenge tom
p00205_B,00205,B,i mean i ll enjoy myself a little and go about and see something and hear something i ll recompense myself for the way in which i have been brought up
p00206_B,00206,B,but don t disappoint yourself beforehand tom mr bounderby thinks as father thinks and is a great deal rougher and not half so kind
p00207_B,00207,B,oh i don t mind that i shall very well know how to manage and smooth old bounderby
p00208_B,00208,B,what is your great mode of smoothing and managing tom is it a secret
p00209_B,00209,B,oh if it is a secret it s not far off it s you you are his little pet you are his favourite he ll do anything for you when he says to me what i don t like i shall say to him that ll bring him about or nothing will have you gone to sleep loo
p00210_B,00210,B,no tom i am looking at the fire
p00211_B,00211,B,you seem to find more to look at in it than ever i could find another of the advantages i suppose of being a girl
p00212_B,00212,B,tom do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to mr bounderby s
p00213_B,00213,B,why there s one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home
p00214_B,00214,B,there is one thing to be said of it it will be getting away from home yes
p00215_B,00215,B,not but what i shall be very unwilling both to leave you loo and to leave you here but i must go you know whether i like it or not and i had better go where i can take with me some advantage of your influence than where i should lose it altogether don t you see
p00216_B,00216,B,yes tom
p00217_B,00217,B,except that it is a fire it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks what do you see in it not a circus
p00218_B,00218,B,i don t see anything in it tom particularly but since i have been looking at it i have been wondering about you and me grown up
p00219_B,00219,B,wondering again
p00220_B,00220,B,i have such unmanageable thoughts that they will wonder
p00221_B,00221,B,i was encouraged by nothing mother but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire and whitening and dying it made me think after all how short my life would be and how little i could hope to do in it
p00222_B,00222,B,nonsense nonsense don t stand there and tell me such stuff louisa to my face when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father s ears i should never hear the last of it after all the trouble that has been taken with you after the lectures you have attended and the experiments you have seen after i have heard you myself when the whole of my right side has been benumbed going on with your master about combustion and calcination and calorification and i may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes i wish yes i really do wish that i had never had a family and then you would have known what it was to do without me
p00223_B,00223,B,to do unto others as i would that they should do unto me
p00224_B,00224,B,do you think so
p00225_B,00225,B,i should know so much miss louisa all that is difficult to me now would be so easy then
p00226_B,00226,B,you might not be the better for it sissy
p00227_B,00227,B,i should not be the worse miss louisa
p00228_B,00228,B,i don t know that you are more useful to my mother and more pleasant with her than i can ever be you are pleasanter to yourself than i am to my self
p00229_B,00229,B,but if you please miss louisa i am o so stupid you don t know what a stupid girl i am all through school hours i make mistakes mr and mrs m choakumchild call me up over and over again regularly to make mistakes i can t help them they seem to come natural to me
p00230_B,00230,B,mr and mrs m choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves i suppose sissy
p00231_B,00231,B,o no they know everything
p00232_B,00232,B,tell me some of your mistakes
p00233_B,00233,B,i am almost ashamed but to day for instance mr m choakumchild was explaining to us about natural prosperity
p00234_B,00234,B,national i think it must have been
p00235_B,00235,B,yes it was but isn t it the same
p00236_B,00236,B,you had better say national as he said so
p00237_B,00237,B,national prosperity and he said now this schoolroom is a nation and in this nation there are fifty millions of money isn t this a prosperous nation girl number twenty isn t this a prosperous nation and a n t you in a thriving state
p00238_B,00238,B,what did you say
p00239_B,00239,B,miss louisa i said i didn t know i thought i couldn t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not and whether i was in a thriving state or not unless i knew who had got the money and whether any of it was mine but that had nothing to do with it it was not in the figures at all
p00240_B,00240,B,that was a great mistake of yours
p00241_B,00241,B,yes miss louisa i know it was now then mr m choakumchild said he would try me again and he said this schoolroom is an immense town and in it there are a million of inhabitants and only five and twenty are starved to death in the streets in the course of a year what is your remark on that proportion and my remark was for i couldn t think of a better one that i thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved whether the others were a million or a million million and that was wrong too
p00242_B,00242,B,of course it was
p00243_B,00243,B,then mr m choakumchild said he would try me once more and he said here are the stutterings
p00244_B,00244,B,nothing sissy
p00245_B,00245,B,nothing miss to the relations and friends of the people who were killed i shall never learn and the worst of all is that although my poor father wished me so much to learn and although i am so anxious to learn because he wished me to i am afraid i don t like it
p00246_B,00246,B,did your father know so much himself that he wished you to be well taught too sissy no one hears us and if any one did i am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question
p00247_B,00247,B,no miss louisa father knows very little indeed it s as much as he can do to write and it s more than people in general can do to read his writing though it s plain to me
p00248_B,00248,B,your mother
p00249_B,00249,B,father says she was quite a scholar she died when i was born she was she was a dancer
p00250_B,00250,B,did your father love her
p00251_B,00251,B,o yes as dearly as he loves me father loved me first for her sake he carried me about with him when i was quite a baby we have never been asunder from that time
p00252_B,00252,B,yet he leaves you now sissy
p00253_B,00253,B,only for my good nobody understands him as i do nobody knows him as i do when he left me for my good he never would have left me for his own i know he was almost broken hearted with the trial he will not be happy for a single minute till he comes back
p00254_B,00254,B,tell me more about him i will never ask you again where did you live
p00255_B,00255,B,we travelled about the country and had no fixed place to live in father s a a clown
p00256_B,00256,B,to make the people laugh
p00257_B,00257,B,yes but they wouldn t laugh sometimes and then father cried lately they very often wouldn t laugh and he used to come home despairing father s not like most those who didn t know him as well as i do and didn t love him as dearly as i do might believe he was not quite right sometimes they played tricks upon him but they never knew how he felt them and shrunk up when he was alone with me he was far far timider than they thought
p00258_B,00258,B,and you were his comfort through everything
p00259_B,00259,B,i hope so and father said i was it was because he grew so scared and trembling and because he felt himself to be a poor weak ignorant helpless man those used to be his words that he wanted me so much to know a great deal and be different from him i used to read to him to cheer his courage and he was very fond of that they were wrong books i am never to speak of them here but we didn t know there was any harm in them
p00260_B,00260,B,and he liked them
p00261_B,00261,B,o very much they kept him many times from what did him real harm and often and often of a night he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the sultan would let the lady go on with the story or would have her head cut off before it was finished
p00262_B,00262,B,and your father was always kind to the last
p00263_B,00263,B,always always kinder and kinder than i can tell he was angry only one night and that was not to me but merrylegs merrylegs is his performing dog
p00264_B,00264,B,why was he angry with the dog
p00265_B,00265,B,father soon after they came home from performing told merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them which is one of his tricks he looked at father and didn t do it at once everything of father s had gone wrong that night and he hadn t pleased the public at all he cried out that the very dog knew he was failing and had no compassion on him then he beat the dog and i was frightened and said and he stopped and the dog was bloody and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms and the dog licked his face
p00266_B,00266,B,finish by telling me how your father left you sissy now that i have asked you so much tell me the end the blame if there is any blame is mine not yours
p00267_B,00267,B,dear miss louisa i came home from the school that afternoon and found poor father just come home too from the booth and he sat rocking himself over the fire as if he was in pain and i said as he did sometimes like they all did and he said and when i came to stoop down and look up at his face i saw that he was crying the more i spoke to him the more he hid his face and at first he shook all over and said nothing but and
p00268_B,00268,B,i am asking sissy a few questions tom you have no occasion to go away but don t interrupt us for a moment tom dear
p00269_B,00269,B,oh very well only father has brought old bounderby home and i want you to come into the drawing room because if you come there s a good chance of old bounderby s asking me to dinner and if you don t there s none

p00271_B,00271,B,i ll wait for you to make sure
p00272_B,00272,B,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone
p00273_B,00273,B,i say look sharp for old bounderby loo
p00274_B,00274,B,there s no more to tell miss louisa i keep the nine oils ready for him and i know he will come back every letter that i see in mr gradgrind s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes for i think it comes from father or from mr sleary about father mr sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of and i trust to him to keep his word

p00325_B,00325,B,now i tell you what there is such a law but it s not for you at all it costs money it costs a mint of money

p00375_B,00375,B,why i have been otherwise engaged loo in the evenings and in the daytime old bounderby has been keeping me at it rather but i touch him up with you when he comes it too strong and so we preserve an understanding i say has father said anything particular to you to day or yesterday loo
p00376_B,00376,B,no tom but he told me to night that he wished to do so in the morning
p00377_B,00377,B,ah that s what i mean do you know where he is to night
p00378_B,00378,B,indeed i am tom though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me
p00379_B,00379,B,well sister of mine when you say that you are near my thoughts we might be so much oftener together mightn t we always together almost mightn t we it would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to i know what loo it would be a splendid thing for me it would be uncommonly jolly i say loo i thought i d come and just hint to you what was going on though i supposed you d most likely guess even if you didn t know i can t stay because i m engaged to some fellows to night you won t forget how fond you are of me
p00380_B,00380,B,no dear tom i won t forget
p00381_B,00381,B,that s a capital girl good bye loo
p00382_B,00382,B,i hear you father i am attending i assure you
p00383_B,00383,B,well you are even more dispassionate than i expected louisa or perhaps you are not unprepared for the announcement i have it in charge to make
p00384_B,00384,B,i cannot say that father until i hear it prepared or unprepared i wish to hear it all from you i wish to hear you state it to me father
p00385_B,00385,B,what you say my dear louisa is perfectly reasonable i have undertaken then to let you know that in short that mr bounderby has informed me that he has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he should offer you his hand in marriage that time to which he has so long and certainly with great constancy looked forward is now come mr bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me and has entreated me to make it known to you and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration
p00386_B,00386,B,father do you think i love mr bounderby
p00387_B,00387,B,well my child i really cannot take upon myself to say
p00388_B,00388,B,father do you ask me to love mr bounderby
p00389_B,00389,B,my dear louisa no no i ask nothing
p00390_B,00390,B,father does mr bounderby ask me to love him
p00391_B,00391,B,really my dear it is difficult to answer your question
p00392_B,00392,B,difficult to answer it yes or no father
p00393_B,00393,B,certainly my dear because because the reply depends so materially louisa on the sense in which we use the expression now mr bounderby does not do you the injustice and does not do himself the injustice of pretending to anything fanciful fantastic or i am using synonymous terms sentimental mr bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes to very little purpose if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense not to say to his as to address you from any such ground therefore perhaps the expression itself i merely suggest this to you my dear may be a little misplaced
p00394_B,00394,B,what would you advise me to use in its stead father
p00395_B,00395,B,why my dear louisa i would advise you since you ask me to consider this question as you have been accustomed to consider every other question simply as one of tangible fact the ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies and other absurdities that have no existence properly viewed really no existence but it is no compliment to you to say that you know better now what are the facts of this case you are we will say in round numbers twenty years of age mr bounderby is we will say in round numbers fifty there is some disparity in your respective years but in your means and positions there is none on the contrary there is a great suitability then the question arises is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage in considering this question it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage so far as they have yet been obtained in england and wales i find on reference to the figures that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages and that the elder of these contracting parties is in rather more than three fourths of these instances the bridegroom it is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law that among the natives of the british possessions in india also in a considerable part of china and among the calmucks of tartary the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers yield similar results the disparity i have mentioned therefore almost ceases to be disparity and virtually all but disappears
p00396_B,00396,B,what do you recommend father that i should substitute for the term i used just now for the misplaced expression
p00397_B,00397,B,louisa it appears to me that nothing can be plainer confining yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact you state to yourself is does mr bounderby ask me to marry him yes he does the sole remaining question then is shall i marry him i think nothing can be plainer than that
p00398_B,00398,B,shall i marry him
p00399_B,00399,B,precisely and it is satisfactory to me as your father my dear louisa to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind and habits of life that belong to many young women
p00400_B,00400,B,no father i do not
p00401_B,00401,B,i now leave you to judge for yourself i have stated the case as such cases are usually stated among practical minds i have stated it as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time the rest my dear louisa is for you to decide are you consulting the chimneys of the coketown works louisa
p00402_B,00402,B,there seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke yet when the night comes fire bursts out father
p00403_B,00403,B,of course i know that louisa i do not see the application of the remark
p00404_B,00404,B,father i have often thought that life is very short
p00405_B,00405,B,it is short no doubt my dear still the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years the calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices among other figures which cannot go wrong have established the fact
p00406_B,00406,B,i speak of my own life father
p00407_B,00407,B,o indeed still i need not point out to you louisa that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate
p00408_B,00408,B,while it lasts i would wish to do the little i can and the little i am fit for what does it matter
p00409_B,00409,B,how matter what matter my dear
p00410_B,00410,B,mr bounderby asks me to marry him the question i have to ask myself is shall i marry him that is so father is it not you have told me so father have you not
p00411_B,00411,B,certainly my dear
p00412_B,00412,B,let it be so since mr bounderby likes to take me thus i am satisfied to accept his proposal tell him father as soon as you please that this was my answer repeat it word for word if you can because i should wish him to know what i said
p00413_B,00413,B,it is quite right my dear to be exact i will observe your very proper request have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage my child
p00414_B,00414,B,none father what does it matter
p00415_B,00415,B,louisa i have not considered it essential to ask you one question because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote but perhaps i ought to do so you have never entertained in secret any other proposal
p00416_B,00416,B,father what other proposal can have been made to me whom have i seen where have i been what are my heart s experiences
p00417_B,00417,B,my dear louisa you correct me justly i merely wished to discharge my duty
p00418_B,00418,B,what do i know father of tastes and fancies of aspirations and affections of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished what escape have i had from problems that could be demonstrated and realities that could be grasped
p00419_B,00419,B,my dear quite true quite true
p00420_B,00420,B,why father what a strange question to ask me the baby preference that even i have heard of as common among children has never had its innocent resting place in my breast you have been so careful of me that i never had a child s heart you have trained me so well that i never dreamed a child s dream you have dealt so wisely with me father from my cradle to this hour that i never had a child s belief or a child s fear
p00421_B,00421,B,my dear louisa you abundantly repay my care kiss me my dear girl i may assure you now my favourite child that i am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived mr bounderby is a very remarkable man and what little disparity can be said to exist between you if any is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired it has always been my object so to educate you as that you might while still in your early youth be if i may so express myself almost any age kiss me once more louisa now let us go and find your mother
p00422_B,00422,B,oh so you have settled it well i m sure i hope your health may be good louisa for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married which was the case with mine i cannot consider that you are to be envied though i have no doubt you think you are as all girls do however i give you joy my dear and i hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account i am sure i do i must give you a kiss of congratulation louisa but don t touch my right shoulder for there s something running down it all day long and now you see i shall be worrying myself morning noon and night to know what i am to call him
p00423_B,00423,B,mrs gradgrind what do you mean
p00424_B,00424,B,whatever i am to call him mr gradgrind when he is married to louisa i must call him something it s impossible to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name i cannot call him josiah for the name is insupportable to me you yourself wouldn t hear of joe you very well know am i to call my own son in law mister not i believe unless the time has arrived when as an invalid i am to be trampled upon by my relations then what am i to call him as to the wedding all i ask louisa is and i ask it with a fluttering in my chest which actually extends to the soles of my feet that it may take place soon otherwise i know it is one of those subjects i shall never hear the last of
p00425_B,00425,B,good evening ma am good evening your fireside sir i freely admit it it is for you to occupy it all if you think proper don t go to the north pole ma am
p00426_B,00426,B,thank you sir
p00427_B,00427,B,mrs sparsit ma am i have no occasion to say to you that you are not only a lady born and bred but a devilish sensible woman
p00428_B,00428,B,sir this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion
p00429_B,00429,B,mrs sparsit ma am i am going to astonish you
p00430_B,00430,B,yes sir
p00431_B,00431,B,i am going ma am to marry tom gradgrind s daughter
p00432_B,00432,B,yes sir i hope you may be happy mr bounderby oh indeed i hope you may be happy sir
p00433_B,00433,B,now confound this woman who could have even guessed that she would take it in this way
p00434_B,00434,B,well ma am i am obliged to you i hope i shall be
p00435_B,00435,B,do you sir but naturally you do of course you do
p00436_B,00436,B,well ma am under these circumstances i imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here though you would be very welcome here
p00437_B,00437,B,oh dear no sir i could on no account think of that
p00438_B,00438,B,however ma am there are apartments at the bank where a born and bred lady as keeper of the place would be rather a catch than otherwise and if the same terms
p00439_B,00439,B,i beg your pardon sir you were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase annual compliment
p00440_B,00440,B,well ma am annual compliment if the same annual compliment would be acceptable there why i see nothing to part us unless you do
p00441_B,00441,B,sir the proposal is like yourself and if the position i shall assume at the bank is one that i could occupy without descending lower in the social scale
p00442_B,00442,B,why of course it is if it was not ma am you don t suppose that i should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in not that i care for such society you know but you do
p00443_B,00443,B,mr bounderby you are very considerate
p00444_B,00444,B,you ll have your own private apartments and you ll have your coals and your candles and all the rest of it and you ll have your maid to attend upon you and you ll have your light porter to protect you and you ll be what i take the liberty of considering precious comfortable
p00445_B,00445,B,sir say no more in yielding up my trust here i shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence and i would rather receive it from your hand than from any other therefore sir i accept your offer gratefully and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours and i hope sir i fondly hope that miss gradgrind may be all you desire and deserve
p00446_B,00446,B,ladies and gentlemen i am josiah bounderby of coketown since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness i suppose i must acknowledge the same though as you all know me and know what i am and what my extraction was you won t expect a speech from a man who when he sees a post says and when he sees a pump says and is not to be got to call a post a pump or a pump a post or either of them a toothpick if you want a speech this morning my friend and father in law tom gradgrind is a member of parliament and you know where to get it i am not your man however if i feel a little independent when i look around this table to day and reflect how little i thought of marrying tom gradgrind s daughter when i was a ragged street boy who never washed his face unless it was at a pump and that not oftener than once a fortnight i hope i may be excused so i hope you like my feeling independent if you don t i can t help it i do feel independent now i have mentioned and you have mentioned that i am this day married to tom gradgrind s daughter i am very glad to be so it has long been my wish to be so i have watched her bringing up and i believe she is worthy of me at the same time not to deceive you i believe i am worthy of her so i thank you on both our parts for the good will you have shown towards us and the best wish i can give the unmarried part of the present company is this i hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as i have found and i hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found

p00453_B,00453,B,what are the restless wretches doing now
p00454_B,00454,B,merely going on in the old way ma am uniting and leaguing and engaging to stand by one another
p00455_B,00455,B,it is much to be regretted that the united masters allow of any such class combinations
p00456_B,00456,B,yes ma am
p00457_B,00457,B,being united themselves they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man
p00458_B,00458,B,they have done that ma am but it rather fell through ma am
p00459_B,00459,B,i do not pretend to understand these things my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere and mr sparsit as a powler being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions i only know that these people must be conquered and that it s high time it was done once for all
p00460_B,00460,B,yes ma am you couldn t put it clearer i am sure ma am
p00461_B,00461,B,has it been a busy day bitzer

p00467_B,00467,B,bitzer do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names
p00468_B,00468,B,i beg your pardon ma am it s quite true that you did object to names being used and they re always best avoided
p00469_B,00469,B,please to remember that i have a charge here i hold a trust here bitzer under mr bounderby however improbable both mr bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago that he would ever become my patron making me an annual compliment i cannot but regard him in that light from mr bounderby i have received every acknowledgment of my social station and every recognition of my family descent that i could possibly expect more far more therefore to my patron i will be scrupulously true and i do not consider i will not consider i cannot consider that i should be scrupulously true if i allowed names to be mentioned under this roof that are unfortunately most unfortunately no doubt of that connected with his no bitzer say an individual and i will hear you say mr thomas and you must excuse me
p00470_B,00470,B,with the usual exception ma am of an individual
p00471_B,00471,B,ah h
p00472_B,00472,B,an individual ma am has never been what he ought to have been since he first came into the place he is a dissipated extravagant idler he is not worth his salt ma am he wouldn t get it either if he hadn t a friend and relation at court ma am
p00473_B,00473,B,ah h
p00474_B,00474,B,i only hope ma am that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on otherwise ma am we know out of whose pocket that money comes
p00475_B,00475,B,ah h
p00476_B,00476,B,he is to be pitied ma am the last party i have alluded to is to be pitied ma am
p00477_B,00477,B,yes bitzer i have always pitied the delusion always
p00478_B,00478,B,as to an individual ma am he is as improvident as any of the people in this town and you know what their improvidence is ma am no one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does
p00479_B,00479,B,they would do well to take example by you bitzer
p00480_B,00480,B,thank you ma am but since you do refer to me now look at me ma am i have put by a little ma am already that gratuity which i receive at christmas ma am i never touch it i don t even go the length of my wages though they re not high ma am why can t they do as i have done ma am what one person can do another can do as to their wanting recreations ma am it s stuff and nonsense i don t want recreations i never did and i never shall i don t like em as to their combining together there are many of them i have no doubt that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then whether in money or good will and improve their livelihood then why don t they improve it ma am it s the first consideration of a rational creature and it s what they pretend to want
p00481_B,00481,B,pretend indeed
p00482_B,00482,B,i am sure we are constantly hearing ma am till it becomes quite nauseous concerning their wives and families why look at me ma am i don t want a wife and family why should they
p00483_B,00483,B,because they are improvident
p00484_B,00484,B,yes ma am that s where it is if they were more provident and less perverse ma am what would they do they would say or as the case might be ma am
p00485_B,00485,B,to be sure

p00502_B,00502,B,powler family you must be very much bored here
p00503_B,00503,B,i am the servant of circumstances sir and i have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life
p00504_B,00504,B,very philosophical and very exemplary and laudable and
p00505_B,00505,B,may i be permitted to ask sir to what i am indebted for the favour of
p00506_B,00506,B,assuredly much obliged to you for reminding me i am the bearer of a letter of introduction to mr bounderby the banker walking through this extraordinarily black town while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel i asked a fellow whom i met one of the working people who appeared to have been taking a shower bath of something fluffy which i assume to be the raw material raw material where mr bounderby the banker might reside upon which misled no doubt by the word banker he directed me to the bank fact being i presume that mr bounderby the banker does not reside in the edifice in which i have the honour of offering this explanation
p00507_B,00507,B,no sir he does not
p00508_B,00508,B,thank you i had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment nor have i but strolling on to the bank to kill time and having the good fortune to observe at the window a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance i considered that i could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where mr bounderby the banker does live which i accordingly venture with all suitable apologies to do banks i know are always suspicious and officially must be therefore i may observe that my letter here it is is from the member for this place gradgrind whom i have had the pleasure of knowing in london thousand thanks of course you know the banker well
p00509_B,00509,B,yes sir in my dependent relation towards him i have known him ten years
p00510_B,00510,B,quite an eternity i think he married gradgrind s daughter
p00511_B,00511,B,yes he had that honour
p00512_B,00512,B,the lady is quite a philosopher i am told
p00513_B,00513,B,indeed sir is she
p00514_B,00514,B,excuse my impertinent curiosity but you know the family and know the world i am about to know the family and may have much to do with them is the lady so very alarming her father gives her such a portentously hard headed reputation that i have a burning desire to know is she absolutely unapproachable repellently and stunningly clever i see by your meaning smile you think not you have poured balm into my anxious soul as to age now forty five and thirty
p00515_B,00515,B,a chit not twenty when she was married
p00516_B,00516,B,i give you my honour mrs powler that i never was so astonished in my life i assure you mrs powler that the father s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity i am obliged to you of all things for correcting so absurd a mistake pray excuse my intrusion many thanks good day
p00517_B,00517,B,what do you think of the gentleman bitzer
p00518_B,00518,B,spends a deal of money on his dress ma am
p00519_B,00519,B,it must be admitted that it s very tasteful
p00520_B,00520,B,yes ma am if that s worth the money besides which ma am he looks to me as if he gamed
p00521_B,00521,B,it s immoral to game
p00522_B,00522,B,it s ridiculous ma am because the chances are against the players
p00523_B,00523,B,o you fool
p00524_B,00524,B,my name sir is josiah bounderby of coketown coketown sir is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to therefore if you will allow me or whether you will or not for i am a plain man i ll tell you something about it before we go any further don t be too sure of that i don t promise it first of all you see our smoke that s meat and drink to us it s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects and particularly for the lungs if you are one of those who want us to consume it i differ from you we are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear em out now for all the humbugging sentiment in great britain and ireland
p00525_B,00525,B,mr bounderby i assure you i am entirely and completely of your way of thinking on conviction
p00526_B,00526,B,i am glad to hear it now you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills no doubt you have very good i ll state the fact of it to you it s the pleasantest work there is and it s the lightest work there is and it s the best paid work there is more than that we couldn t improve the mills themselves unless we laid down turkey carpets on the floors which we re not a going to do
p00527_B,00527,B,mr bounderby perfectly right
p00528_B,00528,B,lastly as to our hands there s not a hand in this town sir man woman or child but has one ultimate object in life that object is to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon now they re not a going none of em ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and now you know the place why you see it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man particularly with a public man when i make his acquaintance i have only one thing more to say to you mr harthouse before assuring you of the pleasure with which i shall respond to the utmost of my poor ability to my friend tom gradgrind s letter of introduction you are a man of family don t you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that i am a man of family i am a bit of dirty riff raff and a genuine scrap of tag rag and bobtail so now we may shake hands on equal terms i say equal terms because although i know what i am and the exact depth of the gutter i have lifted myself out of better than any man does i am as proud as you are i am just as proud as you are having now asserted my independence in a proper manner i may come to how do you find yourself and i hope you re pretty well perhaps you know or perhaps you don t know i married tom gradgrind s daughter if you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me i shall be glad to introduce you to tom gradgrind s daughter
p00529_B,00529,B,mr bounderby you anticipate my dearest wishes
p00530_B,00530,B,this sir is my wife mrs bounderby tom gradgrind s eldest daughter loo mr james harthouse mr harthouse has joined your father s muster roll if he is not tom gradgrind s colleague before long i believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns you observe mr harthouse that my wife is my junior i don t know what she saw in me to marry me but she saw something in me i suppose or she wouldn t have married me she has lots of expensive knowledge sir political and otherwise if you want to cram for anything i should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than loo bounderby
p00531_B,00531,B,come if you re in the complimentary line you ll get on here for you ll meet with no competition i have never been in the way of learning compliments myself and i don t profess to understand the art of paying em in fact despise em but your bringing up was different from mine mine was a real thing by george you re a gentleman and i don t pretend to be one i am josiah bounderby of coketown and that s enough for me however though i am not influenced by manners and station loo bounderby may be she hadn t my advantages disadvantages you would call em but i call em advantages so you ll not waste your power i dare say mr bounderby is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works
p00532_B,00532,B,you respect mr bounderby very much it is natural that you should
p00533_B,00533,B,now how am i to take this
p00534_B,00534,B,mrs bounderby upon my honour no i will make no such pretence to you i have seen a little here and there up and down i have found it all to be very worthless as everybody has and as some confess they have and some do not and i am going in for your respected father s opinions really because i have no choice of opinions and may as well back them as anything else
p00535_B,00535,B,have you none of your own
p00536_B,00536,B,i have not so much as the slightest predilection left i assure you i attach not the least importance to any opinions the result of the varieties of boredom i have undergone is a conviction unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment i entertain on the subject that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set and just as much harm as any other set there s an english family with a charming italian motto what will be will be it s the only truth going the side that can prove anything in a line of units tens hundreds and thousands mrs bounderby seems to me to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i am quite as much attached to it as if i believed it i am quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believed it and what more could i possibly do if i did believe it
p00537_B,00537,B,you are a singular politician
p00538_B,00538,B,pardon me i have not even that merit we are the largest party in the state i assure you mrs bounderby if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together
p00539_B,00539,B,when you were my age you hadn t a wrong balance to get right and hadn t to dress afterwards
p00540_B,00540,B,never mind that now
p00541_B,00541,B,well then don t begin with me
p00542_B,00542,B,mrs bounderby your brother s face is quite familiar to me can i have seen him abroad or at some public school perhaps
p00543_B,00543,B,no he has never been abroad yet and was educated here at home tom love i am telling mr harthouse that he never saw you abroad
p00544_B,00544,B,no such luck sir
p00545_B,00545,B,so much the more is this whelp the only creature she has ever cared for so much the more so much the more
p00546_B,00546,B,i believe you
p00547_B,00547,B,a very good fellow indeed
p00548_B,00548,B,you think so don t you
p00549_B,00549,B,what a comical brother in law you are
p00550_B,00550,B,what a comical brother in law old bounderby is i think you mean
p00551_B,00551,B,you are a piece of caustic tom
p00552_B,00552,B,oh i don t care for old bounderby if you mean that i have always called old bounderby by the same name when i have talked about him and i have always thought of him in the same way i am not going to begin to be polite now about old bounderby it would be rather late in the day
p00553_B,00553,B,don t mind me but take care when his wife is by you know
p00554_B,00554,B,his wife my sister loo o yes my sister loo she never cared for old bounderby
p00555_B,00555,B,that s the past tense tom we are in the present tense now
p00556_B,00556,B,verb neuter not to care indicative mood present tense first person singular i do not care second person singular thou dost not care third person singular she does not care
p00557_B,00557,B,good very quaint though you don t mean it
p00558_B,00558,B,but i do mean it upon my honour why you won t tell me mr harthouse that you really suppose my sister loo does care for old bounderby
p00559_B,00559,B,my dear fellow what am i bound to suppose when i find two married people living in harmony and happiness
p00560_B,00560,B,you know our governor mr harthouse and therefore you needn t be surprised that loo married old bounderby she never had a lover and the governor proposed old bounderby and she took him
p00561_B,00561,B,very dutiful in your interesting sister
p00562_B,00562,B,yes but she wouldn t have been as dutiful and it would not have come off as easily if it hadn t been for me i persuaded her i was stuck into old bounderby s bank where i never wanted to be and i knew i should get into scrapes there if she put old bounderby s pipe out so i told her my wishes and she came into them she would do anything for me it was very game of her wasn t it
p00563_B,00563,B,it was charming tom
p00564_B,00564,B,not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me because my liberty and comfort and perhaps my getting on depended on it and she had no other lover and staying at home was like staying in jail especially when i was gone it wasn t as if she gave up another lover for old bounderby but still it was a good thing in her
p00565_B,00565,B,perfectly delightful and she gets on so placidly
p00566_B,00566,B,oh she s a regular girl a girl can get on anywhere she has settled down to the life and she don t mind it does just as well as another besides though loo is a girl she s not a common sort of girl she can shut herself up within herself and think as i have often known her sit and watch the fire for an hour at a stretch
p00567_B,00567,B,ay ay has resources of her own
p00568_B,00568,B,not so much of that as you may suppose for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust it s his system
p00569_B,00569,B,formed his daughter on his own model
p00570_B,00570,B,his daughter ah and everybody else why he formed me that way
p00571_B,00571,B,come tom i can hardly believe that a joke s a joke
p00572_B,00572,B,upon my soul i am serious i am indeed oh i have picked up a little since i don t deny that but i have done it myself no thanks to the governor
p00573_B,00573,B,and your intelligent sister
p00574_B,00574,B,my intelligent sister is about where she was she used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon that girls usually fall back upon and i don t see how she is to have got over that since but she don t mind girls can always get on somehow
p00575_B,00575,B,calling at the bank yesterday evening for mr bounderby s address i found an ancient lady there who seems to entertain great admiration for your sister
p00576_B,00576,B,mother sparsit what you have seen her already have you mother sparsit s feeling for loo is more than admiration i should think say affection and devotion mother sparsit never set her cap at bounderby when he was a bachelor oh no
p00577_B,00577,B,come it s late be off

p00582_B,00582,B,oh my friends and fellow men i do not wonder that you the prostrate sons of labour are incredulous of the existence of such a man but he who sold his birthright for a mess of pottage existed and judas iscariot existed and castlereagh existed and this man exists my friends by virtue o my office as your president i askes o our friend slackbridge who may be a little over hetter in this business to take his seat whiles this man stephen blackpool is heern you all know this man stephen blackpool you know him awlung o his misfort ns and his good name

p00683_B,00683,B,mrs bounderby i esteem it a most fortunate accident that i find you alone here i have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you your brother my young friend tom
p00684_B,00684,B,being so impulsive
p00685_B,00685,B,mrs bounderby no you know i make no pretence with you you know i am a sordid piece of human nature ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum and altogether incapable of any arcadian proceeding whatever
p00686_B,00686,B,i am waiting for your further reference to my brother
p00687_B,00687,B,you are rigid with me and i deserve it i am as worthless a dog as you will find except that i am not false not false but you surprised and started me from my subject which was your brother i have an interest in him
p00688_B,00688,B,have you an interest in anything mr harthouse
p00689_B,00689,B,if you had asked me when i first came here i should have said no i must say now even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence and of justly awakening your incredulity yes
p00690_B,00690,B,mr harthouse i give you credit for being interested in my brother
p00691_B,00691,B,thank you i claim to deserve it you know how little i do claim but i will go that length you have done so much for him you are so fond of him your whole life mrs bounderby expresses such charming self forgetfulness on his account pardon me again i am running wide of the subject i am interested in him for his own sake mrs bounderby it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother s years if he is heedless inconsiderate and expensive a little dissipated in the common phrase is he
p00692_B,00692,B,i know he does
p00693_B,00693,B,of course he loses
p00694_B,00694,B,i do not think it likely
p00695_B,00695,B,or between himself and i may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning i am sure and his highly esteemed brother in law
p00696_B,00696,B,i do not think that likely either
p00697_B,00697,B,mrs bounderby may there be a better confidence between yourself and me tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you
p00698_B,00698,B,you will understand mr harthouse you will understand that if i tell you what you press to know it is not by way of complaint or regret i would never complain of anything and what i have done i do not in the least regret
p00699_B,00699,B,so spirited too
p00700_B,00700,B,mrs bounderby though a graceless person of the world worldly i feel the utmost interest i assure you in what you tell me i cannot possibly be hard upon your brother i understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors with all possible respect both for mr gradgrind and for mr bounderby i think i perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play he rushes into these extremes for himself from opposite extremes that have long been forced with the very best intentions we have no doubt upon him mr bounderby s fine bluff english independence though a most charming characteristic does not as we have agreed invite confidence if i might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken a character misconceived and abilities misdirected would turn for relief and guidance i should express what it presents to my own view all allowance must be made i have one great fault to find with tom however which i cannot forgive and for which i take him heavily to account perhaps i have said enough perhaps it would have been better on the whole if no allusion to it had escaped me
p00701_B,00701,B,you alarm me mr harthouse pray let me know it
p00702_B,00702,B,to relieve you from needless apprehension and as this confidence regarding your brother which i prize i am sure above all possible things has been established between us i obey i cannot forgive him for not being more sensible in every word look and act of his life of the affection of his best friend of the devotion of his best friend of her unselfishness of her sacrifice the return he makes her within my observation is a very poor one what she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude not his ill humour and caprice careless fellow as i am i am not so indifferent mrs bounderby as to be regardless of this vice in your brother or inclined to consider it a venial offence in a word it is to correct your brother in this mrs bounderby that i must aspire my better knowledge of his circumstances and my direction and advice in extricating them rather valuable i hope as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale will give me some influence over him and all i gain i shall certainly use towards this end i have said enough and more than enough i seem to be protesting that i am a sort of good fellow when upon my honour i have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect and openly announce that i am nothing of the sort yonder among the trees is your brother himself no doubt just come down as he seems to be loitering in this direction it may be as well perhaps to walk towards him and throw ourselves in his way he has been very silent and doleful of late perhaps his brotherly conscience is touched if there are such things as consciences though upon my honour i hear of them much too often to believe in them
p00703_B,00703,B,whose name tom have you been carving on the trees
p00704_B,00704,B,whose name oh you mean what girl s name
p00705_B,00705,B,you have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature s on the bark tom
p00706_B,00706,B,not much of that mr harthouse unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me or she might be as ugly as she was rich without any fear of losing me i d carve her name as often as she liked
p00707_B,00707,B,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00708_B,00708,B,mercenary who is not mercenary ask my sister
p00709_B,00709,B,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00710_B,00710,B,you know whether the cap fits you loo if it does you can wear it
p00711_B,00711,B,tom is misanthropical to day as all bored people are now and then don t believe him mrs bounderby he knows much better i shall disclose some of his opinions of you privately expressed to me unless he relents a little
p00712_B,00712,B,at all events mr harthouse you can t tell her that i ever praised her for being mercenary i may have praised her for being the contrary and i should do it again if i had as good reason however never mind this now it s not very interesting to you and i am sick of the subject
p00713_B,00713,B,tom my fine fellow i want to have a word with you tom what s the matter
p00714_B,00714,B,oh mr harthouse i am hard up and bothered out of my life
p00715_B,00715,B,my good fellow so am i
p00716_B,00716,B,you you are the picture of independence mr harthouse i am in a horrible mess you have no idea what a state i have got myself into what a state my sister might have got me out of if she would only have done it
p00717_B,00717,B,tom you are inconsiderate you expect too much of your sister you have had money of her you dog you know you have
p00718_B,00718,B,well mr harthouse i know i have how else was i to get it here s old bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month or something of that sort here s my father drawing what he calls a line and tying me down to it from a baby neck and heels here s my mother who never has anything of her own except her complaints what is a fellow to do for money and where am i to look for it if not to my sister
p00719_B,00719,B,but my dear tom if your sister has not got it
p00720_B,00720,B,not got it mr harthouse i don t say she has got it i may have wanted more than she was likely to have got but then she ought to get it she could get it it s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now after what i have told you already you know she didn t marry old bounderby for her own sake or for his sake but for my sake then why doesn t she get what i want out of him for my sake she is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it she is sharp enough she could manage to coax it out of him if she chose then why doesn t she choose when i tell her of what consequence it is but no there she sits in his company like a stone instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily i don t know what you may call this but i call it unnatural conduct
p00721_B,00721,B,my dear tom let me try to be your banker
p00722_B,00722,B,for god s sake don t talk about bankers
p00723_B,00723,B,what is the present need tom three figures out with them say what they are
p00724_B,00724,B,mr harthouse it s too late the money is of no use to me at present i should have had it before to be of use to me but i am very much obliged to you you re a true friend
p00725_B,00725,B,whelp whelp what an ass you are
p00726_B,00726,B,well it may be of more use by and by and my good fellow if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you i may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself
p00727_B,00727,B,thank you i wish i had known you sooner mr harthouse
p00728_B,00728,B,now you see tom every man is selfish in everything he does and i am exactly like the rest of my fellow creatures i am desperately intent on your softening towards your sister which you ought to do and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother which you ought to be
p00729_B,00729,B,i will be mr harthouse
p00730_B,00730,B,no time like the present tom begin at once
p00731_B,00731,B,certainly i will and my sister loo shall say so
p00732_B,00732,B,having made which bargain tom we will tear ourselves asunder until dinner time
p00733_B,00733,B,i didn t mean to be cross loo i know you are fond of me and you know i am fond of you
p00734_B,00734,B,so much the less is the whelp the only creature that she cares for so much the less so much the less

p00736_B,00736,B,then you haven t heard
p00737_B,00737,B,i have heard you and so has this brute i have heard nothing else
p00738_B,00738,B,the bank s robbed
p00739_B,00739,B,you don t mean it
p00740_B,00740,B,robbed last night sir robbed in an extraordinary manner robbed with a false key
p00741_B,00741,B,of much
p00742_B,00742,B,why no not of very much but it might have been
p00743_B,00743,B,of how much
p00744_B,00744,B,oh as a sum if you stick to a sum of not more than a hundred and fifty pound but it s not the sum it s the fact it s the fact of the bank being robbed that s the important circumstance i am surprised you don t see it
p00745_B,00745,B,my dear bounderby i do see it and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be by the spectacle afforded to my mental view nevertheless i may be allowed i hope to congratulate you which i do with all my soul i assure you on your not having sustained a greater loss
p00746_B,00746,B,thank ee but i tell you what it might have been twenty thousand pound
p00747_B,00747,B,i suppose it might
p00748_B,00748,B,suppose it might by the lord you may suppose so by george it might have been twice twenty there s no knowing what it would have been or wouldn t have been as it was but for the fellows being disturbed
p00749_B,00749,B,i have already had the honour
p00750_B,00750,B,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00751_B,00751,B,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00752_B,00752,B,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00753_B,00753,B,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00754_B,00754,B,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00755_B,00755,B,well while he was snoring or choking or dutch clocking or something or other being asleep some fellows somehow whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen got to young tom s safe forced it and abstracted the contents being then disturbed they made off letting themselves out at the main door and double locking it again it was double locked and the key under mrs sparsit s pillow with a false key which was picked up in the street near the bank about twelve o clock to day no alarm takes place till this chap bitzer turns out this morning and begins to open and prepare the offices for business then looking at tom s safe he sees the door ajar and finds the lock forced and the money gone
p00756_B,00756,B,where is tom by the by
p00757_B,00757,B,he has been helping the police and stays behind at the bank i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his time of life they would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job i can tell em that
p00758_B,00758,B,is anybody suspected
p00759_B,00759,B,suspected i should think there was somebody suspected egod josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody suspected no thank you well i ll tell you it s not to be mentioned everywhere it s not to be mentioned anywhere in order that the scoundrels concerned there s a gang of em may be thrown off their guard so take this in confidence now wait a bit what should you say to to a hand being in it
p00760_B,00760,B,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00761_B,00761,B,say pool instead of pot sir and that s the man o yes i know i know i am used to that i know all about it they are the finest people in the world these fellows are they have got the gift of the gab they have they only want to have their rights explained to them they do but i tell you what show me a dissatisfied hand and i ll show you a man that s fit for anything bad i don t care what it is but i am acquainted with these chaps i can read em off like books mrs sparsit ma am i appeal to you what warning did i give that fellow the first time he set foot in the house when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock religion over and floor the established church mrs sparsit in point of high connexions you are on a level with the aristocracy did i say or did i not say to that fellow
p00762_B,00762,B,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00763_B,00763,B,when he shocked you ma am when he shocked your feelings
p00764_B,00764,B,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00765_B,00765,B,you can recall for yourself harthouse what i said to him when you saw him i didn t mince the matter with him i am never mealy with em i know em very well sir three days after that he bolted went off nobody knows where as my mother did in my infancy only with this difference that he is a worse subject than my mother if possible what did he do before he went what do you say to his being seen night after night watching the bank to his lurking about there after dark to its striking mrs sparsit that he could be lurking for no good to her calling bitzer s attention to him and their both taking notice of him and to its appearing on inquiry to day that he was also noticed by the neighbours
p00766_B,00766,B,suspicious certainly
p00767_B,00767,B,i think so sir i think so but there are more of em in it there s an old woman one never hears of these things till the mischief s done all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen there s an old woman turns up now an old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick every now and then she watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins and on the night when you saw him she steals away with him and holds a council with him i suppose to make her report on going off duty and be damned to her this is not all of em even as we already know em but i have said enough for the present you ll have the goodness to keep it quiet and mention it to no one it may take time but we shall have em it s policy to give em line enough and there s no objection to that
p00768_B,00768,B,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00769_B,00769,B,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00770_B,00770,B,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00771_B,00771,B,but it is my duty to remember that what i was i am no longer indeed if i could altogether cancel the remembrance that mr sparsit was a powler or that i myself am related to the scadgers family or if i could even revoke the fact and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions i would gladly do so i should think it under existing circumstances right to do so
p00772_B,00772,B,i haven t played backgammon ma am since that time
p00773_B,00773,B,no sir i am aware that you have not i remember that miss gradgrind takes no interest in the game but i shall be happy sir if you will condescend

p00780_B,00780,B,why i have got out of the habit of taking it now ma am

p00800_B,00800,B,tom do you believe the man i gave the money to is really implicated in this crime
p00801_B,00801,B,i don t know i don t see why he shouldn t be
p00802_B,00802,B,he seemed to me an honest man
p00803_B,00803,B,another person may seem to you dishonest and yet not be so in short if you come to that perhaps i was so far from being altogether in his favour that i took him outside the door to tell him quietly that i thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister and that i hoped he would make good use of it you remember whether i took him out or not i say nothing against the man he may be a very good fellow for anything i know i hope he is
p00804_B,00804,B,was he offended by what you said
p00805_B,00805,B,no he took it pretty well he was civil enough where are you loo good night my dear good night

p00810_B,00810,B,an occasion i am sure not to be forgotten by myself in the course of ages
p00811_B,00811,B,we live in a singular world sir
p00812_B,00812,B,i have had the honour by a coincidence of which i am proud to have made a remark similar in effect though not so epigrammatically expressed
p00813_B,00813,B,a singular world i would say sir as regards the intimacies we form at one time with individuals we were quite ignorant of at another i recall sir that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of miss gradgrind
p00814_B,00814,B,your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves i availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate mrs sparsit s talent for in fact for anything requiring accuracy with a combination of strength of mind and family is too habitually developed to admit of any question
p00815_B,00815,B,you found miss gradgrind i really cannot call her mrs bounderby it s very absurd of me as youthful as i described her
p00816_B,00816,B,you drew her portrait perfectly presented her dead image
p00817_B,00817,B,very engaging sir
p00818_B,00818,B,highly so
p00819_B,00819,B,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00820_B,00820,B,if i waited to be taken care of by my wife ma am i believe you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday so i ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot
p00821_B,00821,B,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00822_B,00822,B,you may set your mind at rest ma am you can take it very quietly can t you loo
p00823_B,00823,B,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00824_B,00824,B,why should it be of any importance to any one mrs sparsit ma am you attach too much importance to these things ma am by george you ll be corrupted in some of your notions here you are old fashioned ma am you are behind tom gradgrind s children s time
p00825_B,00825,B,what is the matter with you what has given you offence
p00826_B,00826,B,offence do you suppose if there was any offence given me i shouldn t name it and request to have it corrected i am a straightforward man i believe i don t go beating about for side winds
p00827_B,00827,B,i suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident or too delicate i have never made that objection to you either as a child or as a woman i don t understand what you would have
p00828_B,00828,B,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00829_B,00829,B,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00830_B,00830,B,my benefactor
p00831_B,00831,B,i want to hear of you mother not of myself
p00832_B,00832,B,you want to hear of me my dear that s something new i am sure when anybody wants to hear of me not at all well louisa very faint and giddy
p00833_B,00833,B,are you in pain dear mother
p00834_B,00834,B,i think there s a pain somewhere in the room but i couldn t positively say that i have got it you very seldom see your sister she grows like you i wish you would look at her sissy bring her here do you see the likeness louisa
p00835_B,00835,B,yes mother i should think her like me but
p00836_B,00836,B,eh yes i always say so and that reminds me i i want to speak to you my dear sissy my good girl leave us alone a minute
p00837_B,00837,B,you were going to speak to me mother
p00838_B,00838,B,eh yes to be sure my dear you know your father is almost always away now and therefore i must write to him about it
p00839_B,00839,B,about what mother don t be troubled about what
p00840_B,00840,B,you must remember my dear that whenever i have said anything on any subject i have never heard the last of it and consequently that i have long left off saying anything
p00841_B,00841,B,i can hear you mother
p00842_B,00842,B,you learnt a great deal louisa and so did your brother ologies of all kinds from morning to night if there is any ology left of any description that has not been worn to rags in this house all i can say is i hope i shall never hear its name
p00843_B,00843,B,i can hear you mother when you have strength to go on
p00844_B,00844,B,but there is something not an ology at all that your father has missed or forgotten louisa i don t know what it is i have often sat with sissy near me and thought about it i shall never get its name now but your father may it makes me restless i want to write to him to find out for god s sake what it is give me a pen give me a pen
p00845_B,00845,B,to hear is to obey and pray sir if i may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve which is indeed hardy in me for i well know you have a reason for everything you do have you received intelligence respecting the robbery
p00846_B,00846,B,why ma am no not yet under the circumstances i didn t expect it yet rome wasn t built in a day ma am
p00847_B,00847,B,very true sir
p00848_B,00848,B,nor yet in a week ma am
p00849_B,00849,B,no indeed sir
p00850_B,00850,B,in a similar manner ma am i can wait you know if romulus and remus could wait josiah bounderby can wait they were better off in their youth than i was however they had a she wolf for a nurse i had only a she wolf for a grandmother she didn t give any milk ma am she gave bruises she was a regular alderney at that
p00851_B,00851,B,very sagacious indeed sir very interesting the old woman you mentioned sir
p00852_B,00852,B,the old woman i mentioned ma am is not laid hold of but she may take her oath she will be if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind in the mean time ma am i am of opinion if you ask me my opinion that the less she is talked about the better
p00853_B,00853,B,if not quite
p00854_B,00854,B,oh perfectly
p00855_B,00855,B,his face and his manner and what he said
p00856_B,00856,B,perfectly and an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be lengthy and prosy in the extreme it was knowing to hold forth in the humble virtue school of eloquence but i assure you i thought at the time
p00857_B,00857,B,it has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man
p00858_B,00858,B,my dear louisa as tom says you know no good of the fellow
p00859_B,00859,B,no certainly
p00860_B,00860,B,nor of any other such person
p00861_B,00861,B,how can i when i know nothing of them men or women
p00862_B,00862,B,my dear louisa then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow creatures for excellent they are i am quite ready to believe in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of this fellow talks well every fellow talks he professes morality well all sorts of humbugs profess morality from the house of commons to the house of correction there is a general profession of morality except among our people it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving you saw and heard the case here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend mr bounderby who as we know is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand the member of the fluffy classes was injured exasperated left the house grumbling met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this bank business went in put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before and relieved his mind extremely really he would have been an uncommon instead of a common fellow if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity or he may have originated it altogether if he had the cleverness
p00863_B,00863,B,i almost feel as though it must be bad in me to be so ready to agree with you and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say
p00864_B,00864,B,i only say what is reasonable nothing worse i have talked it over with my friend tom more than once of course i remain on terms of perfect confidence with tom and he is quite of my opinion and i am quite of his will you walk
p00865_B,00865,B,pray sir let me beg you not to say that your absence will make a vast difference to me sir as i think you very well know
p00866_B,00866,B,well ma am then you must get on in my absence as well as you can
p00867_B,00867,B,mr bounderby your will is to me a law sir otherwise it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to miss gradgrind to receive me as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality but you shall say no more sir i will go upon your invitation
p00868_B,00868,B,why when i invite you to my house ma am i should hope you want no other invitation
p00869_B,00869,B,no indeed sir i should hope not say no more sir i would sir i could see you gay again
p00870_B,00870,B,what do you mean ma am
p00871_B,00871,B,sir there was wont to be an elasticity in you which i sadly miss be buoyant sir
p00872_B,00872,B,thank ee mrs sparsit
p00873_B,00873,B,how is mr harthouse mr tom
p00874_B,00874,B,oh he s all right
p00875_B,00875,B,where may he be at present
p00876_B,00876,B,he is shooting in yorkshire sent loo a basket half as big as a church yesterday
p00877_B,00877,B,the kind of gentleman now whom one might wager to be a good shot
p00878_B,00878,B,why i expect to see him to morrow
p00879_B,00879,B,good news
p00880_B,00880,B,i have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here and i am going to dine with him afterwards i believe he is not coming down to the country house for a week or so being due somewhere else at least he says so but i shouldn t wonder if he was to stop here over sunday and stray that way
p00881_B,00881,B,which reminds me would you remember a message to your sister mr tom if i was to charge you with one
p00882_B,00882,B,well i ll try if it isn t a long un
p00883_B,00883,B,it is merely my respectful compliments and i fear i may not trouble her with my society this week being still a little nervous and better perhaps by my poor self
p00884_B,00884,B,oh if that s all it wouldn t much matter even if i was to forget it for loo s not likely to think of you unless she sees you well mrs sparsit i must be off
p00885_B,00885,B,this is a device to keep him out of the way harthouse is with his sister now
p00886_B,00886,B,not here
p00887_B,00887,B,where louisa
p00888_B,00888,B,not here
p00889_B,00889,B,but we have so little time to make so much of and i have come so far and am altogether so devoted and distracted there never was a slave at once so devoted and ill used by his mistress to look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life and to be received in your frozen manner is heart rending
p00890_B,00890,B,am i to say again that i must be left to myself here
p00891_B,00891,B,but we must meet my dear louisa where shall we meet shall i ride up to the house a few minutes hence innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me
p00892_B,00892,B,what is the matter how strange you look and good heaven have you come here exposed to this storm
p00893_B,00893,B,father you have trained me from my cradle
p00894_B,00894,B,yes louisa
p00895_B,00895,B,i curse the hour in which i was born to such a destiny
p00896_B,00896,B,curse the hour curse the hour
p00897_B,00897,B,how could you give me life and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death where are the graces of my soul where are the sentiments of my heart what have you done o father what have you done with the garden that should have bloomed once in this great wilderness here if it had ever been here its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks i did not mean to say this but father you remember the last time we conversed in this room
p00898_B,00898,B,yes louisa
p00899_B,00899,B,what has risen to my lips now would have risen to my lips then if you had given me a moment s help i don t reproach you father what you have never nurtured in me you have never nurtured in yourself but o if you had only done so long ago or if you had only neglected me what a much better and much happier creature i should have been this day father if you had known when we were last together here what even i feared while i strove against it as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart if you had known that there lingered in my breast sensibilities affections weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength defying all the calculations ever made by man and no more known to his arithmetic than his creator is would you have given me to the husband whom i am now sure that i hate
p00900_B,00900,B,no no my poor child
p00901_B,00901,B,would you have doomed me at any time to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me would you have robbed me for no one s enrichment only for the greater desolation of this world of the immaterial part of my life the spring and summer of my belief my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me my school in which i should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them and to hope in my little sphere to make them better
p00902_B,00902,B,o no no no louisa
p00903_B,00903,B,yet father if i had been stone blind if i had groped my way by my sense of touch and had been free while i knew the shapes and surfaces of things to exercise my fancy somewhat in regard to them i should have been a million times wiser happier more loving more contented more innocent and human in all good respects than i am with the eyes i have now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and thirst upon me father which have never been for a moment appeased with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules and figures and definitions were not quite absolute i have grown up battling every inch of my way
p00904_B,00904,B,i never knew you were unhappy my child
p00905_B,00905,B,father i always knew it in this strife i have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon what i have learned has left me doubting misbelieving despising regretting what i have not learned and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest
p00906_B,00906,B,and you so young louisa
p00907_B,00907,B,and i so young in this condition father for i show you now without fear or favour the ordinary deadened state of my mind as i know it you proposed my husband to me i took him i never made a pretence to him or you that i loved him i knew and father you knew and he knew that i never did i was not wholly indifferent for i had a hope of being pleasant and useful to tom i made that wild escape into something visionary and have slowly found out how wild it was but tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he became so because i knew so well how to pity him it matters little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors when i was irrevocably married there rose up into rebellion against the tie the old strife made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me father until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul
p00908_B,00908,B,what can i do child ask me what you will
p00909_B,00909,B,i am coming to it father chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i had had no experience of used to the world light polished easy making no pretences avowing the low estimate of everything that i was half afraid to form in secret conveying to me almost immediately though i don t know how or by what degrees that he understood me and read my thoughts i could not find that he was worse than i there seemed to be a near affinity between us i only wondered it should be worth his while who cared for nothing else to care so much for me
p00910_B,00910,B,for you louisa
p00911_B,00911,B,i say nothing of his plea for claiming my confidence it matters very little how he gained it father he did gain it what you know of the story of my marriage he soon knew just as well i have done no worse i have not disgraced you but if you ask me whether i have loved him or do love him i tell you plainly father that it may be so i don t know this night my husband being away he has been with me declaring himself my lover this minute he expects me for i could release myself of his presence by no other means i do not know that i am sorry i do not know that i am ashamed i do not know that i am degraded in my own esteem all that i know is your philosophy and your teaching will not save me now father you have brought me to this save me by some other means i shall die if you hold me let me fall upon the ground
p00912_B,00912,B,last night louisa
p00913_B,00913,B,who brought me here
p00914_B,00914,B,sissy i believe
p00915_B,00915,B,why do you believe so
p00916_B,00916,B,because i found her here this morning she didn t come to my bedside to wake me as she always does and i went to look for her she was not in her own room either and i went looking for her all over the house until i found her here taking care of you and cooling your head will you see father sissy said i was to tell him when you woke
p00917_B,00917,B,what a beaming face you have jane
p00918_B,00918,B,have i i am very glad you think so i am sure it must be sissy s doing
p00919_B,00919,B,you can tell father if you will it was you who made my room so cheerful and gave it this look of welcome
p00920_B,00920,B,oh no louisa it was done before i came it was
p00921_B,00921,B,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00922_B,00922,B,my dear i have remained all night at my table pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us when i consider your character when i consider that what has been known to me for hours has been concealed by you for years when i consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last i come to the conclusion that i cannot but mistrust myself but if i see reason to mistrust myself for the past louisa i should also mistrust myself for the present and the future to speak unreservedly to you i do i am far from feeling convinced now however differently i might have felt only this time yesterday that i am fit for the trust you repose in me that i know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me that i have the right instinct supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature how to help you and to set you right my child some persons hold that there is a wisdom of the head and that there is a wisdom of the heart i have not supposed so but as i have said i mistrust myself now i have supposed the head to be all sufficient it may not be all sufficient how can i venture this morning to say it is if that other kind of wisdom should be what i have neglected and should be the instinct that is wanted louisa louisa i have been absent from here my dear a good deal of late and though your sister s training has been pursued according to the system it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun in her case at an early age i ask you ignorantly and humbly my daughter for the better do you think
p00923_B,00923,B,father if any harmony has been awakened in her young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord let her thank heaven for it and go upon her happier way taking it as her greatest blessing that she has avoided my way
p00924_B,00924,B,o my child my child i am an unhappy man to see you thus what avails it to me that you do not reproach me if i so bitterly reproach myself louisa i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house by mere love and gratitude that what the head had left undone and could not do the heart may have been doing silently can it be so i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear
p00925_B,00925,B,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00926_B,00926,B,am i i would be something to you if i might
p00927_B,00927,B,my father sent you to ask me
p00928_B,00928,B,no indeed he told me that i might come in now but he sent me away from the room this morning or at least
p00929_B,00929,B,at least what
p00930_B,00930,B,i thought it best myself that i should be sent away for i felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here
p00931_B,00931,B,have i always hated you so much
p00932_B,00932,B,i hope not for i have always loved you and have always wished that you should know it but you changed to me a little shortly before you left home not that i wondered at it you knew so much and i knew so little and it was so natural in many ways going as you were among other friends that i had nothing to complain of and was not at all hurt may i try
p00933_B,00933,B,first sissy do you know what i am i am so proud and so hardened so confused and troubled so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself that everything is stormy dark and wicked to me does not that repel you
p00934_B,00934,B,o lay it here lay it here my dear
p00935_B,00935,B,where were you last night tom
p00936_B,00936,B,where was i last night come i like that i was waiting for you mr harthouse till it came down as i never saw it come down before where was i too where were you you mean
p00937_B,00937,B,i was prevented from coming detained
p00938_B,00938,B,detained two of us were detained i was detained looking for you till i lost every train but the mail it would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night and have to walk home through a pond i was obliged to sleep in town after all
p00939_B,00939,B,did you see your sister
p00940_B,00940,B,how the deuce could i see my sister when she was fifteen miles off
p00941_B,00941,B,so whether i am waiting for a hostile message or an assignation or a penitent remonstrance or an impromptu wrestle with my friend bounderby in the lancashire manner which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs i ll dine bounderby has the advantage in point of weight and if anything of a british nature is to come off between us it may be as well to be in training some dinner at six with a beefsteak in it
p00942_B,00942,B,outside where
p00943_B,00943,B,outside this door sir
p00944_B,00944,B,to mr harthouse and you speak to him with the most confiding eyes i ever saw and the most earnest voice though so quiet i ever heard
p00945_B,00945,B,you may i assure you
p00946_B,00946,B,i have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four and twenty hours which have appeared as many years on a lady s account the hopes i have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady do not deceive me i trust
p00947_B,00947,B,i left her within an hour
p00948_B,00948,B,then i certainly do not see where we are going
p00949_B,00949,B,so startling an announcement so confidently made and by such lips is really disconcerting in the last degree may i be permitted to inquire if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words by the lady of whom we speak
p00950_B,00950,B,i have no charge from her
p00951_B,00951,B,the drowning man catches at the straw with no disrespect for your judgment and with no doubt of your sincerity excuse my saying that i cling to the belief that there is yet hope that i am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady s presence
p00952_B,00952,B,there is not the least hope the first object of my coming here sir is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again than there would be if she had died when she came home last night
p00953_B,00953,B,must believe but if i can t or if i should by infirmity of nature be obstinate and won t
p00954_B,00954,B,it is still true there is no hope
p00955_B,00955,B,well if it should unhappily appear after due pains and duty on my part that i am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment i shall not become the lady s persecutor but you said you had no commission from her
p00956_B,00956,B,i have only the commission of my love for her and her love for me i have no other trust than that i have been with her since she came home and that she has given me her confidence i have no further trust than that i know something of her character and her marriage o mr harthouse i think you had that trust too
p00957_B,00957,B,i am not a moral sort of fellow and i never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow i am as immoral as need be at the same time in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation or in unfortunately compromising her in any way or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her not perfectly reconcilable with in fact with the domestic hearth or in taking any advantage of her father s being a machine or of her brother s being a whelp or of her husband s being a bear i beg to be allowed to assure you that i have had no particularly evil intentions but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical that i had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until i began to turn it over whereas i find that it is really in several volumes after what has been just now represented to me in a manner i find it impossible to doubt i know of hardly any other source from which i could have accepted it so readily i feel bound to say to you in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed that i cannot refuse to contemplate the possibility however unexpected of my seeing the lady no more i am solely to blame for the thing having come to this and and i cannot say that i have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow or that i have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever you spoke of your first object i may assume that there is a second to be mentioned
p00958_B,00958,B,mr harthouse the only reparation that remains with you is to leave here immediately and finally i am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done i am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make i do not say that it is much or that it is enough but it is something and it is necessary therefore though without any other authority than i have given you and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself i ask you to depart from this place to night under an obligation never to return to it
p00959_B,00959,B,but do you know the extent of what you ask you probably are not aware that i am here on a public kind of business preposterous enough in itself but which i have gone in for and sworn by and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner you probably are not aware of that but i assure you it s the fact besides which it s so alarmingly absurd it would make a man so ridiculous after going in for these fellows to back out in such an incomprehensible way
p00960_B,00960,B,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p00961_B,00961,B,upon my soul i don t know what to say so immensely absurd
p00962_B,00962,B,i will trust to you sir and you will trust to me
p00963_B,00963,B,i suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position but i see no way out of it what will be will be this will be i suppose i must take off myself i imagine in short i engage to do it you will permit me to say that i doubt if any other ambassador or ambassadress could have addressed me with the same success i must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position but as being vanquished at all points will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy s name
p00964_B,00964,B,my name
p00965_B,00965,B,the only name i could possibly care to know to night
p00966_B,00966,B,sissy jupe
p00967_B,00967,B,pardon my curiosity at parting related to the family
p00968_B,00968,B,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p00969_B,00969,B,it wanted this to complete the defeat the defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished only a poor girl only a stroller only james harthouse made nothing of only james harthouse a great pyramid of failure
p00970_B,00970,B,gone to bed sir
p00971_B,00971,B,tell him to get up and pack up
p00972_B,00972,B,you have missed my letter
p00973_B,00973,B,missed your letter sir the present time is no time for letters no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown about letters with his mind in the state it s in now
p00974_B,00974,B,bounderby i speak of a very special letter i have written to you in reference to louisa
p00975_B,00975,B,tom gradgrind i speak of a very special messenger that has come to me in reference to louisa mrs sparsit ma am stand forward if you can t get it out ma am leave me to get it out this is not a time for a lady however highly connected to be totally inaudible and seemingly swallowing marbles tom gradgrind mrs sparsit latterly found herself by accident in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman friend mr james harthouse
p00976_B,00976,B,it is not necessary to repeat its tenor bounderby i know what passed
p00977_B,00977,B,you do perhaps you know where your daughter is at the present time
p00978_B,00978,B,undoubtedly she is here
p00979_B,00979,B,now ma am we shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer for going about the country at express pace with no other luggage than a cock and a bull ma am
p00980_B,00980,B,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00981_B,00981,B,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed
p00982_B,00982,B,my dear bounderby
p00983_B,00983,B,now you ll excuse me but i don t want to be too dear that to start with when i begin to be dear to a man i generally find that his intention is to come over me i am not speaking to you politely but as you are aware i am not polite if you like politeness you know where to get it you have your gentleman friends you know and they ll serve you with as much of the article as you want i don t keep it myself
p00984_B,00984,B,bounderby we are all liable to mistakes
p00985_B,00985,B,i thought you couldn t make em
p00986_B,00986,B,perhaps i thought so but i say we are all liable to mistakes and i should feel sensible of your delicacy and grateful for it if you would spare me these references to harthouse i shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement pray do not persist in connecting him with mine
p00987_B,00987,B,i never mentioned his name
p00988_B,00988,B,well well bounderby i see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood louisa
p00989_B,00989,B,who do you mean by we
p00990_B,00990,B,let me say i then i doubt whether i have understood louisa i doubt whether i have been quite right in the manner of her education
p00991_B,00991,B,there you hit it there i agree with you you have found it out at last have you education i ll tell you what education is to be tumbled out of doors neck and crop and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows that s what i call education
p00992_B,00992,B,i think your good sense will perceive that whatever the merits of such a system may be it would be difficult of general application to girls
p00993_B,00993,B,i don t see it at all sir
p00994_B,00994,B,well we will not enter into the question i assure you i have no desire to be controversial i seek to repair what is amiss if i possibly can and i hope you will assist me in a good spirit bounderby for i have been very much distressed
p00995_B,00995,B,i don t understand you yet and therefore i won t make any promises
p00996_B,00996,B,in the course of a few hours my dear bounderby i appear to myself to have become better informed as to louisa s character than in previous years the enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me and the discovery is not mine i think there are bounderby you will be surprised to hear me say this i think there are qualities in louisa which which have been harshly neglected and and a little perverted and and i would suggest to you that that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration it it would be the better for the happiness of all of us louisa has always been my favourite child
p00997_B,00997,B,you d like to keep her here for a time
p00998_B,00998,B,i i had intended to recommend my dear bounderby that you should allow louisa to remain here on a visit and be attended by sissy i mean of course cecilia jupe who understands her and in whom she trusts
p00999_B,00999,B,i gather from all this tom gradgrind that you are of opinion that there s what people call some incompatibility between loo bounderby and myself
p01000_B,01000,B,i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa and and and almost all the relations in which i have placed her
p01001_B,01001,B,now look you here tom gradgrind you have said your say i am going to say mine i am a coketown man i am josiah bounderby of coketown i know the bricks of this town and i know the works of this town and i know the chimneys of this town and i know the smoke of this town and i know the hands of this town i know em all pretty well they re real when a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities i always tell that man whoever he is that i know what he means he means turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six that s what your daughter wants since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants i recommend you to provide it for her because tom gradgrind she will never have it from me
p01002_B,01002,B,bounderby i hoped after my entreaty you would have taken a different tone
p01003_B,01003,B,just wait a bit you have said your say i believe i heard you out hear me out if you please don t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency because although i am sorry to see tom gradgrind reduced to his present position i should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that now there s an incompatibility of some sort or another i am given to understand by you between your daughter and me i ll give you to understand in reply to that that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude to be summed up in this that your daughter don t properly know her husband s merits and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her by george of the honour of his alliance that s plain speaking i hope
p01004_B,01004,B,bounderby this is unreasonable
p01005_B,01005,B,is it i am glad to hear you say so because when tom gradgrind with his new lights tells me that what i say is unreasonable i am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible with your permission i am going on you know my origin and you know that for a good many years of my life i didn t want a shoeing horn in consequence of not having a shoe yet you may believe or not as you think proper that there are ladies born ladies belonging to families families who next to worship the ground i walk on whereas your daughter is far from being a born lady that you know yourself not that i care a pinch of candle snuff about such things for you are very well aware i don t but that such is the fact and you tom gradgrind can t change it why do i say this
p01006_B,01006,B,not i fear to spare me
p01007_B,01007,B,hear me out and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round i say this because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself and to witness her insensibility they have wondered how i have suffered it and i wonder myself now and i won t suffer it
p01008_B,01008,B,bounderby the less we say to night the better i think
p01009_B,01009,B,on the contrary tom gradgrind the more we say to night the better i think that is till i have said all i mean to say and then i don t care how soon we stop i come to a question that may shorten the business what do you mean by the proposal you made just now
p01010_B,01010,B,what do i mean bounderby
p01011_B,01011,B,by your visiting proposition
p01012_B,01012,B,i mean that i hope you may be induced to arrange in a friendly manner for allowing louisa a period of repose and reflection here which may tend to a gradual alteration for the better in many respects
p01013_B,01013,B,to a softening down of your ideas of the incompatibility
p01014_B,01014,B,if you put it in those terms
p01015_B,01015,B,what made you think of this
p01016_B,01016,B,i have already said i fear louisa has not been understood is it asking too much bounderby that you so far her elder should aid in trying to set her right you have accepted a great charge of her for better for worse for
p01017_B,01017,B,come i don t want to be told about that i know what i took her for as well as you do never you mind what i took her for that s my look out
p01018_B,01018,B,i was merely going on to remark bounderby that we may all be more or less in the wrong not even excepting you and that some yielding on your part remembering the trust you have accepted may not only be an act of true kindness but perhaps a debt incurred towards louisa
p01019_B,01019,B,i think differently i am going to finish this business according to my own opinions now i don t want to make a quarrel of it with you tom gradgrind to tell you the truth i don t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject as to your gentleman friend he may take himself off wherever he likes best if he falls in my way i shall tell him my mind if he don t fall in my way i shan t for it won t be worth my while to do it as to your daughter whom i made loo bounderby and might have done better by leaving loo gradgrind if she don t come home to morrow by twelve o clock at noon i shall understand that she prefers to stay away and i shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here and you ll take charge of her for the future what i shall say to people in general of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law will be this i am josiah bounderby and i had my bringing up she s the daughter of tom gradgrind and she had her bringing up and the two horses wouldn t pull together i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man i believe and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common also who in the long run would come up to my mark
p01020_B,01020,B,let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this bounderby before you commit yourself to such a decision
p01021_B,01021,B,i always come to a decision and whatever i do i do at once i should be surprised at tom gradgrind s addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown knowing what he knows of him if i could be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug i have given you my decision and i have got no more to say good night
p01022_B,01022,B,it is mr bounderby and your brother mr tom and a young woman who says her name is rachael and that you know her
p01023_B,01023,B,what do they want sissy dear
p01024_B,01024,B,they want to see you rachael has been crying and seems angry
p01025_B,01025,B,father i cannot refuse to see them for a reason that will explain itself shall they come in here
p01026_B,01026,B,i have
p01027_B,01027,B,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p01028_B,01028,B,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p01029_B,01029,B,why couldn t you say so young tom
p01030_B,01030,B,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p01031_B,01031,B,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p01032_B,01032,B,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p01033_B,01033,B,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p01034_B,01034,B,did you offer him a bank note
p01035_B,01035,B,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p01036_B,01036,B,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p01037_B,01037,B,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p01038_B,01038,B,i am very very sorry
p01039_B,01039,B,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p01040_B,01040,B,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p01041_B,01041,B,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p01042_B,01042,B,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p01043_B,01043,B,so far that s true enough but i have known you people before to day you ll observe and i know you never die for want of talking now i recommend you not so much to mind talking just now as doing you have undertaken to do something all i remark upon that at present is do it
p01044_B,01044,B,i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon as i have written to him once before sin he went away and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01045_B,01045,B,then i ll tell you something you are not aware perhaps that you yourself have been looked after now and then not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep the post office hasn t been forgotten either what i ll tell you is that no letter to stephen blackpool has ever got into it therefore what has become of yours i leave you to guess perhaps you re mistaken and never wrote any
p01046_B,01046,B,he hadn t been gone from here young lady as much as a week when he sent me the only letter i have had from him saying that he was forced to seek work in another name
p01047_B,01047,B,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p01048_B,01048,B,what what young lady in the name of mercy was left the poor lad to do the masters against him on one hand the men against him on the other he only wantin to work hard in peace and do what he felt right can a man have no soul of his own no mind of his own must he go wrong all through wi this side or must he go wrong all through wi that or else be hunted like a hare
p01049_B,01049,B,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p01050_B,01050,B,you need have no fear of that young lady he is sure
p01051_B,01051,B,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p01052_B,01052,B,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p01053_B,01053,B,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p01054_B,01054,B,good night father
p01055_B,01055,B,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p01056_B,01056,B,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p01057_B,01057,B,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p01058_B,01058,B,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p01059_B,01059,B,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p01060_B,01060,B,then i will come next night too
p01061_B,01061,B,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p01062_B,01062,B,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p01063_B,01063,B,that is to say you once persuaded yourself to believe it from knowing him to be suspected his appearance and manner are they so honest
p01064_B,01064,B,very honest
p01065_B,01065,B,and her confidence not to be shaken i ask myself does the real culprit know of these accusations where is he who is he
p01066_B,01066,B,i do believe so with my whole heart i feel so certain rachael that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement is not like to be wrong that i have no more doubt of him than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have
p01067_B,01067,B,and i my dear have known him through them all to be according to his quiet ways so faithful to everything honest and good that if he was never to be heard of more and i was to live to be a hundred years old i could say with my last breath god knows my heart i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool
p01068_B,01068,B,we all believe up at the lodge rachael that he will be freed from suspicion sooner or later
p01069_B,01069,B,the better i know it to be so believed there my dear and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there purposely to comfort me and keep me company and be seen wi me when i am not yet free from all suspicion myself the more grieved i am that i should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady and yet i
p01070_B,01070,B,you don t mistrust her now rachael
p01071_B,01071,B,now that you have brought us more together no but i can t at all times keep out of my mind i can t at all times keep out of my mind mistrustings of some one i can t think who tis i can t think how or why it may be done but i mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way i mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord and showing himself innocent before them all some one would be confounded who to prevent that has stopped him and put him out of the way
p01072_B,01072,B,that is a dreadful thought
p01073_B,01073,B,it is a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered when it makes its way into my mind dear and it will come sometimes though i do all i can to keep it out wi counting on to high numbers as i work and saying over and over again pieces that i knew when i were a child i fall into such a wild hot hurry that however tired i am i want to walk fast miles and miles i must get the better of this before bed time i ll walk home wi you
p01074_B,01074,B,he might fall ill upon the journey back and in such a case there are many places on the road where he might stop
p01075_B,01075,B,but he is in none of them he has been sought for in all and he s not there
p01076_B,01076,B,let us hope that to morrow will bring something better rachael come into the air you re not so hurried now rachael and your hand is cooler
p01077_B,01077,B,i get better dear if i can only walk and breathe a little fresh times when i can t i turn weak and confused
p01078_B,01078,B,but you must not begin to fail rachael for you may be wanted at any time to stand by stephen to morrow is saturday if no news comes to morrow let us walk in the country on sunday morning and strengthen you for another week will you go
p01079_B,01079,B,yes dear
p01080_B,01080,B,it s mrs pegler
p01081_B,01081,B,i should think it is fetch mr bounderby stand away everybody don t tell me i have told you twenty times coming along that i will not leave you till i have handed you over to him myself
p01082_B,01082,B,sir i trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind sir and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside as have been afforded by the young woman rachael fortunately now present to identify i have had the happiness to succeed and to bring that person with me i need not say most unwillingly on her part it has not been sir without some trouble that i have effected this but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure and hunger thirst and cold a real gratification
p01083_B,01083,B,why what do you mean by this i ask you what do you mean by this mrs sparsit ma am
p01084_B,01084,B,my dear josiah my darling boy i am not to blame it s not my fault josiah i told this lady over and over again that i knew she was doing what would not be agreeable to you but she would do it
p01085_B,01085,B,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p01086_B,01086,B,my own boy she threatened me that if i resisted her i should be brought by constables and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a such a fine house as this indeed indeed it is not my fault my dear noble stately boy i have always lived quiet and secret josiah my dear i have never broken the condition once i have never said i was your mother i have admired you at a distance and if i have come to town sometimes with long times between to take a proud peep at you i have done it unbeknown my love and gone away again

p01114_B,01114,B,your wretched brother do you think he had planned this robbery when he went with you to the lodging
p01115_B,01115,B,i fear so father i know he had wanted money very much and had spent a great deal
p01116_B,01116,B,the poor man being about to leave the town it came into his evil brain to cast suspicion on him
p01117_B,01117,B,i think it must have flashed upon him while he sat there father for i asked him to go there with me the visit did not originate with him
p01118_B,01118,B,he had some conversation with the poor man did he take him aside
p01119_B,01119,B,he took him out of the room i asked him afterwards why he had done so and he made a plausible excuse but since last night father and when i remember the circumstances by its light i am afraid i can imagine too truly what passed between them
p01120_B,01120,B,let me know if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine
p01121_B,01121,B,i fear father that he must have made some representation to stephen blackpool perhaps in my name perhaps in his own which induced him to do in good faith and honesty what he had never done before and to wait about the bank those two or three nights before he left the town
p01122_B,01122,B,too plain too plain and now how is he to be found how is he to be saved from justice in the few hours that i can possibly allow to elapse before i publish the truth how is he to be found by us and only by us ten thousand pounds could not effect it
p01123_B,01123,B,sissy has effected it father
p01124_B,01124,B,it is always you my child

p01150_B,01150,B,sir since you ask me what motive i have in reason for taking young mr tom back to coketown it is only reasonable to let you know i have suspected young mr tom of this bank robbery from the first i had had my eye upon him before that time for i knew his ways i have kept my observations to myself but i have made them and i have got ample proofs against him now besides his running away and besides his own confession which i was just in time to overhear i had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning and following you here i am going to take young mr tom back to coketown in order to deliver him over to mr bounderby sir i have no doubt whatever that mr bounderby will then promote me to young mr tom s situation and i wish to have his situation sir for it will be a rise to me and will do me good

p01154_B,01154,B,thank you sir for hinting at the proposal but i will not set any sum against it knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative i have gone over the calculations in my mind and i find that to compound a felony even on very high terms indeed would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the bank

p01262_B,01262,B,i hope i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child
p01263_B,01263,B,the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it
p01264_B,01264,B,you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry i say you ll make your fortune mr sowerberry
p01265_B,01265,B,think so the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble
p01266_B,01266,B,so are the coffins
p01267_B,01267,B,well well mr bumble there s no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble well seasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham
p01268_B,01268,B,well well every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable
p01269_B,01269,B,of course of course and if i don t get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the long run you see he he he
p01270_B,01270,B,just so
p01271_B,01271,B,though i must say though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over one s calculation makes a great hole in one s profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir
p01272_B,01272,B,by the bye you don t know anybody who wants a boy do you a porochial prentis who is at present a dead weight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms
p01273_B,01273,B,gadso that s just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about you know dear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble i never noticed it before
p01274_B,01274,B,yes i think it rather pretty the die is the same as the porochial seal the good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on newyear s morning mr sowerberry i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight
p01275_B,01275,B,i recollect the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didn t they and they made it a special verdict i think by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had
p01276_B,01276,B,tush foolery if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk they d have enough to do
p01277_B,01277,B,very true they would indeed
p01278_B,01278,B,juries juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches
p01279_B,01279,B,so they are
p01280_B,01280,B,they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that
p01281_B,01281,B,no more they have
p01282_B,01282,B,i despise em
p01283_B,01283,B,so do i
p01284_B,01284,B,and i only wish we d a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em
p01285_B,01285,B,let em alone for that
p01286_B,01286,B,well what about the boy
p01287_B,01287,B,oh why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poor s rates
p01288_B,01288,B,hem well

p01910_B,01910,B,hard weather mr bumble
p01911_B,01911,B,hard indeed ma am anti porochial weather this ma am we have given away mrs corney we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented
p01912_B,01912,B,of course not when would they be mr bumble
p01913_B,01913,B,when indeed ma am why here s one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight is he grateful ma am is he grateful not a copper farthing s worth of it what does he do ma am but ask for a few coals if it s only a pocket handkerchief full he says coals what would he do with coals toast his cheese with em and then come back for more that s the way with these people ma am give em a apron full of coals to day and they ll come back for another the day after to morrow as brazen as alabaster i never see anything like the pitch it s got to the day afore yesterday a man you have been a married woman ma am and i may mention it to you a man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseer s door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney as he wouldn t go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal my heart says the ungrateful villain what s the use of this to me you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles very good says our overseer taking em away again you won t get anything else here then i ll die in the streets says the vagrant oh no you won t says our overseer
p01914_B,01914,B,ha ha that was very good so like mr grannett wasn t it well mr bumble

p01917_B,01917,B,mrs corney out of door relief properly managed properly managed ma am is the porochial safeguard the great principle of out of door relief is to give the paupers exactly what they don t want and then they get tired of coming
p01918_B,01918,B,dear me well that is a good one too
p01919_B,01919,B,yes betwixt you and me ma am that s the great principle and that s the reason why if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers you ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese that s the rule now mrs corney all over the country but however these are official secrets ma am not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves this is the port wine ma am that the board ordered for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment
p01920_B,01920,B,you ll have a very cold walk mr bumble

p02021_B,02021,B,regarding this boy my dear
p02022_B,02022,B,the boy must take his chance with the rest and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harm s way and out of yours that is if bill comes to no harm and if toby got clear off bill s pretty sure to be safe for bill s worth two of toby any time
p02023_B,02023,B,and about what i was saying my dear
p02024_B,02024,B,you must say it all over again if it s anything you want me to do and if it is you had better wait till to morrow you put me up for a minute but now i m stupid again
p02025_B,02025,B,yes i have been lingering here these two hours where the devil have you been
p02026_B,02026,B,on your business my dear on your business all night
p02027_B,02027,B,oh of course well and what s come of it
p02028_B,02028,B,nothing good
p02029_B,02029,B,nothing bad i hope it s as dark as the grave make haste
p02030_B,02030,B,shut the door
p02031_B,02031,B,that wasn t my doing the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole
p02032_B,02032,B,we can say the few words we ve got to say in here my dear and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours we ll set the candle on the stairs there
p02033_B,02033,B,i tell you again it was badly planned why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once
p02034_B,02034,B,only hear him
p02035_B,02035,B,why do you mean to say you couldn t have done it if you had chosen haven t you done it with other boys scores of times if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldn t you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life
p02036_B,02036,B,whose turn would that have served my dear
p02037_B,02037,B,what then
p02038_B,02038,B,i saw it was not easy to train him to the business he was not like other boys in the same circumstances
p02039_B,02039,B,curse him no or he would have been a thief long ago
p02040_B,02040,B,i had no hold upon him to make him worse his hand was not in i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain what could i do send him out with the dodger and charley we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all
p02041_B,02041,B,that was not my doing
p02042_B,02042,B,no no my dear and i don t quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for well i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him
p02043_B,02043,B,throttle the girl
p02044_B,02044,B,why we can t afford to do that just now my dear and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done i know what these girls are monks well as soon as the boy begins to harden she ll care no more for him than for a block of wood you want him made a thief if he is alive i can make him one from this time and if if it s not likely mind but if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead
p02045_B,02045,B,it s no fault of mine if he is mind that fagin i had no hand in it anything but his death i told you from the first i won t shed blood it s always found out and haunts a man besides if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me fire this infernal den what s that
p02046_B,02046,B,what where
p02047_B,02047,B,yonder the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath
p02048_B,02048,B,it s your fancy
p02049_B,02049,B,i ll swear i saw it it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away
p02050_B,02050,B,what do you think now besides ourselves there s not a creature in the house except toby and the boys and they re safe enough see here

p02102_B,02102,B,i ll tell you what it is gentlemen we re all afraid
p02103_B,02103,B,speak for yourself sir
p02104_B,02104,B,so i do it s natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances i am
p02105_B,02105,B,so am i only there s no call to tell a man he is so bounceably
p02106_B,02106,B,but it s wonderful what a man will do when his blood is up i should have committed murder i know i should if we d caught one of them rascals i know what it was it was the gate
p02107_B,02107,B,i shouldn t wonder if it was
p02108_B,02108,B,you may depend upon it that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it
p02109_B,02109,B,what sort of a noise
p02110_B,02110,B,a kind of a busting noise
p02111_B,02111,B,more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater
p02112_B,02112,B,it was when you heerd it sir but at this time it had a busting sound i turned down the clothes sat up in bed and listened
p02113_B,02113,B,ladies present mr giles
p02114_B,02114,B,of shoes sir seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket and walked on tiptoes to his room i says when i had woke him
p02115_B,02115,B,so you did
p02116_B,02116,B,i says
p02117_B,02117,B,was he frightened
p02118_B,02118,B,not a bit of it he was as firm ah pretty near as firm as i was
p02119_B,02119,B,i should have died at once i m sure if it had been me
p02120_B,02120,B,you re a woman
p02121_B,02121,B,brittles is right from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark as it might be so it was a knock open the door somebody it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning but the door must be opened do you hear somebody
p02122_B,02122,B,a boy what s the matter with the eh why brittles look here don t you know
p02123_B,02123,B,in a lantern miss
p02124_B,02124,B,hush you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did is the poor creature much hurt
p02125_B,02125,B,wounded desperate miss
p02126_B,02126,B,he looks as if he was a going miss wouldn t you like to come and look at him miss in case he should
p02127_B,02127,B,hush pray there s a good man wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt
p02128_B,02128,B,but won t you take one look at him first miss not one little peep miss
p02129_B,02129,B,not now for the world poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles for my sake
p02130_B,02130,B,an hour and twelve minutes ma am
p02131_B,02131,B,he is always slow
p02132_B,02132,B,brittles always was a slow boy ma am
p02133_B,02133,B,he gets worse instead of better i think
p02134_B,02134,B,it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys
p02135_B,02135,B,oh very much so indeed but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see
p02136_B,02136,B,ah to be sure so there is that was your handiwork giles i understand honour eh well i don t know perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces fancy that he fired in the air and you ve fought a duel giles gad that s true where is he show me the way i ll look in again as i come down mrs maylie that s the little window that he got in at eh well i couldn t have believed it this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie
p02137_B,02137,B,he is not in danger i hope
p02138_B,02138,B,why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the circumstances though i don t think he is have you seen the thief
p02139_B,02139,B,rose wished to see the man but i wouldn t hear of it
p02140_B,02140,B,humph there is nothing very alarming in his appearance have you any objection to see him in my presence
p02141_B,02141,B,if it be necessary certainly not
p02142_B,02142,B,then i think it is necessary at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow me miss rose will you permit me not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour
p02143_B,02143,B,what can this mean this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers
p02144_B,02144,B,vice takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her
p02145_B,02145,B,but at so early an age
p02146_B,02146,B,my dear young lady crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims
p02147_B,02147,B,but can you oh can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society but even if he has been wicked think how young he is think that he may never have known a mother s love or the comfort of a home that ill usage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt aunt dear aunt for mercy s sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment oh as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late
p02148_B,02148,B,my dear love do you think i would harm a hair of his head
p02149_B,02149,B,oh no
p02150_B,02150,B,no surely my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others what can i do to save him sir
p02151_B,02151,B,let me think ma am let me think i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides you don t object to that
p02152_B,02152,B,unless there is some other way of preserving the child
p02153_B,02153,B,there is no other no other take my word for it
p02154_B,02154,B,then my aunt invests you with full power but pray don t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary
p02155_B,02155,B,you seem to think that everybody is disposed to be hard hearted to day except yourself miss rose i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present
p02156_B,02156,B,you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself
p02157_B,02157,B,well that is no very difficult matter but to return to this boy the great point of our agreement is yet to come he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger now i make this stipulation that i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events
p02158_B,02158,B,oh no aunt
p02159_B,02159,B,oh yes aunt is is a bargain
p02160_B,02160,B,he cannot be hardened in vice it is impossible
p02161_B,02161,B,very good then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition
p02162_B,02162,B,thank you sir misses wished some ale to be given out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here how is the patient to night sir
p02163_B,02163,B,so so i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles
p02164_B,02164,B,i hope you don t mean to say sir that he s going to die if i thought it i should never be happy again i wouldn t cut a boy off no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county sir
p02165_B,02165,B,that s not the point mr giles are you a protestant
p02166_B,02166,B,yes sir i hope so
p02167_B,02167,B,and what are you boy
p02168_B,02168,B,lord bless me sir i m the same as mr giles sir
p02169_B,02169,B,then tell me this both of you both of you are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night out with it come we are prepared for you pay attention to the reply constable will you something may come of this before long it s a simple question of identity you will observe
p02170_B,02170,B,that s what it is sir
p02171_B,02171,B,here s the house broken into and a couple of men catch one moment s glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness here s a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon him by doing which they place his life in great danger and swear he is the thief now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they place themselves i ask you again are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy
p02172_B,02172,B,it s the runners
p02173_B,02173,B,the what
p02174_B,02174,B,the bow street officers sir me and mr giles sent for em this morning
p02175_B,02175,B,you did did you then confound your slow coaches down here that s all
p02176_B,02176,B,who s that
p02177_B,02177,B,open the door it s the officers from bow street as was sent to to day just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man he s in the gig a minding the prad have you got a coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you
p02178_B,02178,B,this is the lady of the house
p02179_B,02179,B,now with regard to this here robbery master what are the circumstances i can t say for certain till i see the work of course but my opinion at once is i don t mind committing myself to that extent that this wasn t done by a yokel eh duff
p02180_B,02180,B,certainly not
p02181_B,02181,B,and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman
p02182_B,02182,B,that s it master this is all about the robbery is it
p02183_B,02183,B,nothing at all one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but it s nonsense sheer absurdity
p02184_B,02184,B,wery easy disposed of if it is
p02185_B,02185,B,what he says is quite correct who is the boy what account does he give of himself where did he come from he didn t drop out of the clouds did he master
p02186_B,02186,B,of course not i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose
p02187_B,02187,B,certainly we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards that s the usual way of doing business
p02188_B,02188,B,upon my word i hardly know what to do
p02189_B,02189,B,surely the poor child s story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him
p02190_B,02190,B,i doubt it my dear young lady i don t think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade what is he after all they would say a runaway judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one
p02191_B,02191,B,you believe it surely
p02192_B,02192,B,i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so but i don t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer nevertheless
p02193_B,02193,B,why not
p02194_B,02194,B,because my pretty cross examiner because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a police officer on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentleman s house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a half bred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself don t you see all this
p02195_B,02195,B,i see it of course but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child

p02280_B,02280,B,and consider ma am oh consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her i am sure certain quite certain that for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die heaven will never let her die so young
p02281_B,02281,B,hush you think like a child poor boy but you teach me my duty notwithstanding i had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy god s will be done i love her and he knows how well we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne it must be carried to the market town which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know here is another letter but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know i would not forward it unless i feared the worst
p02282_B,02282,B,is it for chertsey too ma am
p02283_B,02283,B,i think not i will wait until to morrow

p02287_B,02287,B,rot you if i had only had the courage to say the word i might have been free of you in a night curses on your head and black death on your heart you imp what are you doing here
p02288_B,02288,B,you must compose yourself be calm my dear ma am pray
p02289_B,02289,B,let me go in god s name my dear child she is dead she is dying
p02290_B,02290,B,no as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come
p02291_B,02291,B,is it you giles
p02292_B,02292,B,better much better
p02293_B,02293,B,thank heaven you are sure
p02294_B,02294,B,quite sir the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end
p02295_B,02295,B,you are quite certain there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled
p02296_B,02296,B,i would not for the world sir indeed you may believe me mr losberne s words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come i heard him say so
p02297_B,02297,B,i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise giles i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her you can say i am coming
p02298_B,02298,B,i beg your pardon mr harry but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did
p02299_B,02299,B,well you can do as you like let him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen
p02300_B,02300,B,i did but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losberne s opinion
p02301_B,02301,B,but why why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened if rose had i cannot utter that word now if this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself how could i ever have know happiness again
p02302_B,02302,B,if that had been the case harry i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import
p02303_B,02303,B,and who can wonder if it be so mother or why should i say if it is it is you know it mother you must know it
p02304_B,02304,B,i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty
p02305_B,02305,B,this is unkind mother do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul
p02306_B,02306,B,i think my dear son that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting above all i think that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so
p02307_B,02307,B,mother he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus
p02308_B,02308,B,you think so now harry
p02309_B,02309,B,and ever will the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little
p02310_B,02310,B,harry it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now
p02311_B,02311,B,let it rest with rose then you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way
p02312_B,02312,B,i will not but i would have you consider
p02313_B,02313,B,i have considered mother i have considered years and years i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good no before i leave this place rose shall hear me
p02314_B,02314,B,she shall
p02315_B,02315,B,there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother
p02316_B,02316,B,not coldly far from it
p02317_B,02317,B,how then she has formed no other attachment
p02318_B,02318,B,no indeed you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already what i would say is this before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on rose s history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic
p02319_B,02319,B,what do you mean
p02320_B,02320,B,that i leave you to discover i must go back to her god bless you
p02321_B,02321,B,i shall see you again to night
p02322_B,02322,B,by and by when i leave rose
p02323_B,02323,B,you will tell her i am here
p02324_B,02324,B,of course
p02325_B,02325,B,and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her you will not refuse to do this mother
p02326_B,02326,B,no i will tell her all
p02327_B,02327,B,nothing particular sir
p02328_B,02328,B,nor catching any thieves nor identifying any house breakers
p02329_B,02329,B,none at all sir
p02330_B,02330,B,well i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing admirably pray how is brittles
p02331_B,02331,B,the boy is very well sir and sends his respectful duty sir
p02332_B,02332,B,that s well seeing you here reminds me mr giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small commission in your favour just step into this corner a moment will you
p02333_B,02333,B,he could i mistake him think you if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to point him out if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across his grave i fancy i should know if there wasn t a mark above it that he lay buried there
p02334_B,02334,B,that i missed them in an instant
p02335_B,02335,B,then they are in the ditch follow and keep as near me as you can
p02336_B,02336,B,oh no indeed sir i saw him too plainly for that i saw them both as plainly as i see you now
p02337_B,02337,B,the very same man i told you of who came so suddenly upon me at the inn we had our eyes fixed full upon each other and i could swear to him
p02338_B,02338,B,they took this way are you sure
p02339_B,02339,B,as i am that the men were at the window the tall man leaped over just there and the jew running a few paces to the right crept through that gap
p02340_B,02340,B,this is strange
p02341_B,02341,B,strange blathers and duff themselves could make nothing of it
p02342_B,02342,B,a few a very few will suffice rose what i shall have to say has already presented itself to your mind the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you though from my lips you have not heard them stated i i ought to have left here before
p02343_B,02343,B,you should indeed forgive me for saying so but i wish you had
p02344_B,02344,B,i was brought here by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed you had been dying trembling between earth and heaven we know that when the young the beautiful and good are visited with sickness their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest we know heaven help us that the best and fairest of our kind too often fade in blooming a creature a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels fluttered between life and death oh who could hope when the distant world to which she was akin half opened to her view that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this rose rose to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow which a light from above casts upon the earth to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here hardly to know a reason why you should be to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight and yet to pray amid all these consolations that you might be restored to those who loved you these were distractions almost too great to bear they were mine by day and night and with them came such a rushing torrent of fears and apprehensions and selfish regrets lest you should die and never know how devotedly i loved you as almost bore down sense and reason in its course you recovered day by day and almost hour by hour some drop of health came back and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you swelled it again to a high and rushing tide i have watched you change almost from death to life with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection do not tell me that you wish i had lost this for it has softened my heart to all mankind
p02345_B,02345,B,i did not mean that i only wish you had left here that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again to pursuits well worthy of you
p02346_B,02346,B,there is no pursuit more worthy of me more worthy of the highest nature that exists than the struggle to win such a heart as yours rose my own dear rose for years for years i have loved you hoping to win my way to fame and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share thinking in my daydreams how i would remind you in that happy moment of the many silent tokens i had given of a boy s attachment and claim your hand as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us that time has not arrived but here with not fame won and no young vision realised i offer you the heart so long your own and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer
p02347_B,02347,B,your behaviour has ever been kind and noble as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful so hear my answer
p02348_B,02348,B,it is that i may endeavour to deserve you it is dear rose
p02349_B,02349,B,it is that you must endeavour to forget me not as your old and dearly attached companion for that would wound me deeply but as the object of your love look into the world think how many hearts you would be proud to gain are there confide some other passion to me if you will i will be the truest warmest and most faithful friend you have
p02350_B,02350,B,and your reasons rose your reasons for this decision
p02351_B,02351,B,you have a right to know them you can say nothing to alter my resolution it is a duty that i must perform i owe it alike to others and to myself
p02352_B,02352,B,to yourself
p02353_B,02353,B,yes harry i owe it to myself that i a friendless portionless girl with a blight upon my name should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion and fastened myself a clog on all your hopes and projects i owe it to you and yours to prevent you from opposing in the warmth of your generous nature this great obstacle to your progress in the world
p02354_B,02354,B,if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty
p02355_B,02355,B,they do not
p02356_B,02356,B,then you return my love say but that dear rose say but that and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment
p02357_B,02357,B,if i could have done so without doing heavy wrong to him i loved i could have
p02358_B,02358,B,have received this declaration very differently do not conceal that from me at least rose
p02359_B,02359,B,i could stay why should we prolong this painful interview most painful to me and yet productive of lasting happiness notwithstanding for it will be happiness to know that i once held the high place in your regard which i now occupy and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness farewell harry as we have met to day we meet no more but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us we may be long and happily entwined and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity cheer and prosper you
p02360_B,02360,B,another word rose your reason in your own words from your own lips let me hear it
p02361_B,02361,B,the prospect before you is a brilliant one all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life are in store for you but those connections are proud and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place in a word there is a stain upon my name which the world visits on innocent heads i will carry it into no blood but my own and the reproach shall rest alone on me
p02362_B,02362,B,one word more rose dearest rose one more if i had been less less fortunate the world would call it if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny if i had been poor sick helpless would you have turned from me then or has my probable advancement to riches and honour given this scruple birth
p02363_B,02363,B,do not press me to reply the question does not arise and never will it is unfair almost unkind to urge it
p02364_B,02364,B,if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way and light the path before me it is not an idle thing to do so much by the utterance of a few brief words for one who loves you beyond all else oh rose in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment in the name of all i have suffered for you and all you doom me to undergo answer me this one question
p02365_B,02365,B,then if your lot had been differently cast if you had been even a little but not so far above me if i could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds i should have been spared this trial i have every reason to be happy very happy now but then harry i own i should have been happier i cannot help this weakness and it makes my purpose stronger i must leave you now indeed
p02366_B,02366,B,i ask one promise once and only once more say within a year but it may be much sooner i may speak to you again on this subject for the last time
p02367_B,02367,B,not to press me to alter my right determination it will be useless
p02368_B,02368,B,no to hear you repeat it if you will finally repeat it i will lay at your feet whatever of station of fortune i may possess and if you still adhere to your present resolution will not seek by word or act to change it
p02369_B,02369,B,then let it be so it is but one pang the more and by that time i may be enabled to bear it better
p02370_B,02370,B,you will tell me a different tale one of these days
p02371_B,02371,B,i hope i may have good cause to do so though i confess i don t think i shall but yesterday morning you had made up your mind in a great hurry to stay here and to accompany your mother like a dutiful son to the sea side before noon you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go on your road to london and at night you urge me with great mystery to start before the ladies are stirring the consequence of which is that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds too bad isn t it oliver
p02372_B,02372,B,i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr maylie went away sir
p02373_B,02373,B,that s a fine fellow you shall come and see me when you return but to speak seriously harry has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone
p02374_B,02374,B,the great nobs under which designation i presume you include my most stately uncle have not communicated with me at all since i have been here nor at this time of the year is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them
p02375_B,02375,B,well you are a queer fellow but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life there s something in that good training is always desirable whether the race be for place cup or sweepstakes
p02376_B,02376,B,we shall see
p02377_B,02377,B,i hope so sir
p02378_B,02378,B,i shall not be at home again perhaps for some time i wish you would write to me say once a fort night every alternate monday to the general post office in london will you
p02379_B,02379,B,oh certainly sir i shall be proud to do it
p02380_B,02380,B,i should like to know how how my mother and miss maylie are and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take and what you talk about and whether she they i mean seem happy and quite well you understand me
p02381_B,02381,B,oh quite sir quite
p02382_B,02382,B,i would rather you did not mention it to them because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener and it is a trouble and worry to her let it be a secret between you and me and mind you tell me everything i depend upon you
p02383_B,02383,B,halloa something very short of flying will keep pace with me do you hear
p02384_B,02384,B,mrs bumble ma am
p02385_B,02385,B,i am going to sit here as long as i think proper ma am and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative
p02386_B,02386,B,your prerogative
p02387_B,02387,B,i said the word ma am the prerogative of a man is to command
p02388_B,02388,B,and what s the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness
p02389_B,02389,B,to obey ma am your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now i wish he was poor man it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper so cry away
p02390_B,02390,B,get up and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do something desperate are you going
p02391_B,02391,B,certainly my dear certainly i didn t intend to i m going my dear you are so very violent that really i
p02392_B,02392,B,didn t know i was here what do you do here
p02393_B,02393,B,i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my dear
p02394_B,02394,B,you thought they were talking too much what business is it of yours
p02395_B,02395,B,why my dear
p02396_B,02396,B,what business is it of yours
p02397_B,02397,B,it s very true you re matron here my dear but i thought you mightn t be in the way just then
p02398_B,02398,B,i ll tell you what mr bumble we don t want any of your interference you re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don t concern you making everybody in the house laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day be off come
p02399_B,02399,B,all in two months two months no more than two months ago i was not only my own master but everybody else s so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned and now
p02400_B,02400,B,not that i am aware of unless you re mr
p02401_B,02401,B,i see you were not or you have known my name you don t know it i would recommend you not to ask for it
p02402_B,02402,B,i meant no harm young man
p02403_B,02403,B,and have done none i have seen you before i think you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again you were beadle here once were you not
p02404_B,02404,B,i was porochial beadle
p02405_B,02405,B,just so it was in that character i saw you what are you now
p02406_B,02406,B,master of the workhouse master of the workhouse young man
p02407_B,02407,B,you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i doubt not don t scruple to answer freely man i know you pretty well you see
p02408_B,02408,B,i suppose a married man is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner
p02409_B,02409,B,fill this glass again let it be strong and hot you like it so i suppose
p02410_B,02410,B,not too strong
p02411_B,02411,B,you understand what that means landlord now listen to me i came down to this place to day to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind i want some information from you i don t ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is put up that to begin with carry your memory back let me see twelve years last winter
p02412_B,02412,B,it s a long time very good i ve done it
p02413_B,02413,B,the scene the workhouse
p02414_B,02414,B,the lying in room i suppose
p02415_B,02415,B,yes a boy was born there
p02416_B,02416,B,a many boys
p02417_B,02417,B,a murrain on the young devils i speak of one a meek looking pale faced boy who was apprenticed down here to a coffin maker i wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in it and who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed
p02418_B,02418,B,why you mean oliver young twist i remember him of course there wasn t a obstinater young rascal
p02419_B,02419,B,it s not of him i want to hear i ve heard enough of him it s of a woman the hag that nursed his mother where is she
p02420_B,02420,B,where is she it would be hard to tell there s no midwifery there whichever place she s gone to so i suppose she s out of employment anyway
p02421_B,02421,B,what do you mean
p02422_B,02422,B,that she died last winter
p02423_B,02423,B,how can i find her
p02424_B,02424,B,only through me
p02425_B,02425,B,at nine in the evening at nine in the evening bring her to me there i needn t tell you to be secret it s your interest what do you want following me
p02426_B,02426,B,only to ask a question what name am i to ask for
p02427_B,02427,B,is that the man then mind what i told you and be careful to say as little as you can or you ll betray us at once
p02428_B,02428,B,we we were only cooling ourselves
p02429_B,02429,B,cooling yourselves not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hell s fire out as a man can carry about with him you won t cool yourself so easily don t think it this is the woman is it
p02430_B,02430,B,hem that is the woman
p02431_B,02431,B,you think women never can keep secrets i suppose
p02432_B,02432,B,i know they will always keep one till it s found out
p02433_B,02433,B,and what may that be
p02434_B,02434,B,the loss of their own good name so by the same rule if a woman s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her i m not afraid of her telling it to anybody not i do you understand mistress
p02435_B,02435,B,about the mother of the boy you named yes
p02436_B,02436,B,the first question is of what nature was her communication
p02437_B,02437,B,that s the second the first is what may the communication be worth
p02438_B,02438,B,who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is
p02439_B,02439,B,nobody better than you i am persuaded
p02440_B,02440,B,humph there may be money s worth to get eh
p02441_B,02441,B,perhaps there may
p02442_B,02442,B,something that was taken from her something that she wore something that
p02443_B,02443,B,you had better bid i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to what s it worth to you
p02444_B,02444,B,it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds speak out and let me know which
p02445_B,02445,B,add five pounds to the sum you have named give me five and twenty pounds in gold and i ll tell you all i know not before
p02446_B,02446,B,five and twenty pounds
p02447_B,02447,B,i spoke as plainly as i could it s not a large sum either
p02448_B,02448,B,not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when it s told and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more
p02449_B,02449,B,such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last
p02450_B,02450,B,what if i pay it for nothing
p02451_B,02451,B,you can easily take it away again i am but a woman alone here and unprotected
p02452_B,02452,B,not alone my dear nor unprotected neither i am here my dear and besides mr monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons mr monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a little run to seed as i may say but he has heerd i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my dear that i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if i m once roused i only want a little rousing that s all
p02453_B,02453,B,you are a fool and had better hold your tongue
p02454_B,02454,B,he had better have cut it out before he came if he can t speak in a lower tone so he s your husband eh
p02455_B,02455,B,he my husband
p02456_B,02456,B,i thought as much when you came in so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that there s only one will between them i m in earnest see here now gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the house top is gone let s hear your story
p02457_B,02457,B,when this woman that we called old sally died she and i were alone
p02458_B,02458,B,was there no one by no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed no one who could hear and might by possibility understand
p02459_B,02459,B,not a soul we were alone i stood alone beside the body when death came over it
p02460_B,02460,B,good go on
p02461_B,02461,B,she spoke of a young creature who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying
p02462_B,02462,B,ay blood how things come about
p02463_B,02463,B,the child was the one you named to him last night the mother this nurse had robbed
p02464_B,02464,B,in life
p02465_B,02465,B,in death she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infant s sake
p02466_B,02466,B,she sold it did she sell it where when to whom how long before
p02467_B,02467,B,as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this she fell back and died
p02468_B,02468,B,without saying more it s a lie i ll not be played with she said more i ll tear the life out of you both but i ll know what it was
p02469_B,02469,B,she didn t utter another word but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper
p02470_B,02470,B,which contained
p02471_B,02471,B,nothing it was a pawnbroker s duplicate
p02472_B,02472,B,for what
p02473_B,02473,B,in good time i ll tell you i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge
p02474_B,02474,B,where is it now
p02475_B,02475,B,there it has the word agnes engraved on the inside there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born i found out that
p02476_B,02476,B,and this is all
p02477_B,02477,B,all i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at and i want to know nothing for it s safer not but i may ask you two questions may i
p02478_B,02478,B,you may ask but whether i answer or not is another question
p02479_B,02479,B,which makes three
p02480_B,02480,B,is that what you expected to get from me
p02481_B,02481,B,it is the other question
p02482_B,02482,B,what do you propose to do with it can it be used against me
p02483_B,02483,B,never nor against me either see here but don t move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush look down don t fear me i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game if you flung a man s body down there where would it be to morrow morning
p02484_B,02484,B,twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides
p02485_B,02485,B,there if the sea ever gives up its dead as books say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party
p02486_B,02486,B,by all means
p02487_B,02487,B,you ll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you i am not afraid of your wife

p02568_B,02568,B,let me stand lady and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better it is growing late is is that door shut
p02569_B,02569,B,yes why
p02570_B,02570,B,because i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagin s on the night he went out from the house in pentonville
p02571_B,02571,B,what dreadful things are these
p02572_B,02572,B,thank heaven upon your knees dear lady that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness and and something worse than all as i have been from my cradle i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed
p02573_B,02573,B,i pity you it wrings my heart to hear you
p02574_B,02574,B,heaven bless you for your goodness if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard do you know a man named monks
p02575_B,02575,B,i never heard the name
p02576_B,02576,B,then he goes by some other amongst us which i more than thought before some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery i suspecting this man listened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monks the man i asked you about you know
p02577_B,02577,B,yes i understand
p02578_B,02578,B,that monks had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldn t make out why a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own
p02579_B,02579,B,for what purpose
p02580_B,02580,B,he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery but i did and i saw him no more till last night
p02581_B,02581,B,and what occurred then
p02582_B,02582,B,i ll tell you lady last night he came again again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door the first words i heard monks say were these they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now he d rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides
p02583_B,02583,B,what is all this
p02584_B,02584,B,the truth lady though it comes from my lips then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldn t he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet he says
p02585_B,02585,B,his brother
p02586_B,02586,B,those were his words and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your two legged spaniel was
p02587_B,02587,B,you do not mean to tell me that this was said in earnest
p02588_B,02588,B,he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this i must get back quickly
p02589_B,02589,B,but what can i do to what use can i turn this communication without you back why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay
p02590_B,02590,B,i wish to go back i must go back because how can i tell such things to an innocent lady like you because among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i can t leave no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now
p02591_B,02591,B,your having interfered in this dear boy s behalf before your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed oh do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the first the first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things
p02592_B,02592,B,lady dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late
p02593_B,02593,B,it is never too late for penitence and atonement
p02594_B,02594,B,it is i cannot leave him now i could not be his death
p02595_B,02595,B,why should you be
p02596_B,02596,B,nothing could save him if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel
p02597_B,02597,B,is it possible that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue it is madness
p02598_B,02598,B,i don t know what it is i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself i must go back whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last
p02599_B,02599,B,what am i to do i should not let you depart from me thus
p02600_B,02600,B,you should lady and i know you will you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done
p02601_B,02601,B,of what use then is the communication you have made this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve
p02602_B,02602,B,you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do
p02603_B,02603,B,but where can i find you again when it is necessary i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time
p02604_B,02604,B,will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed
p02605_B,02605,B,i promise you solemnly
p02606_B,02606,B,every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve i will walk on london bridge if i am alive
p02607_B,02607,B,stay another moment think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it you have a claim on me not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touch is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation
p02608_B,02608,B,when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are give away your hearts love will carry you all lengths even such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us pity us lady pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering
p02609_B,02609,B,you will take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonesty at all events until we meet again
p02610_B,02610,B,not a penny
p02611_B,02611,B,do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you i wish to serve you indeed
p02612_B,02612,B,you would serve me best lady if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am to night than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine
p02613_B,02613,B,if it be painful to him to come back here how painful it will be to me but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting me he did when he went away i hardly thought he would but it was better for us both
p02614_B,02614,B,i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked oh dear to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth
p02615_B,02615,B,i never thought you had told us anything but the truth but what is this of whom do you speak
p02616_B,02616,B,i have seen the gentleman the gentleman who was so good to me mr brownlow that we have so often talked about
p02617_B,02617,B,quick tell them to fetch a hackney coach and be ready to go with me i will take you there directly without a minute s loss of time i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour and be ready as soon as you are
p02618_B,02618,B,mr brownlow i believe sir
p02619_B,02619,B,that is my name this is my friend mr grimwig grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes
p02620_B,02620,B,i believe that at this period of our interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again
p02621_B,02621,B,do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heaven s name put me in possession of it
p02622_B,02622,B,a bad one i ll eat my head if he is not a bad one
p02623_B,02623,B,he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over
p02624_B,02624,B,i m only sixty one and as the devil s in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i don t see the application of that remark
p02625_B,02625,B,do not heed my friend miss maylie he does not mean what he says
p02626_B,02626,B,yes he does
p02627_B,02627,B,no he does not
p02628_B,02628,B,he ll eat his head if he doesn t
p02629_B,02629,B,he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does
p02630_B,02630,B,and he d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it
p02631_B,02631,B,now miss maylie to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken thank god this is great happiness to me great happiness but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie you must pardon my finding fault with you but why not have brought him
p02632_B,02632,B,he is waiting in a coach at the door
p02633_B,02633,B,at this door
p02634_B,02634,B,hush don t be afraid i m old enough to be your grandfather you re a sweet girl i like you here they are
p02635_B,02635,B,well that i do sir people s eyes at my time of life don t improve with age sir
p02636_B,02636,B,i could have told you that but put on your glasses and see if you can t find out what you were wanted for will you
p02637_B,02637,B,god be good to me it is my innocent boy
p02638_B,02638,B,my dear old nurse
p02639_B,02639,B,he would come back i knew he would how well he looks and how like a gentleman s son he is dressed again where have you been this long long while ah the same sweet face but not so pale the same soft eye but not so sad i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature
p02640_B,02640,B,not exactly that but we must proceed gently and with great care
p02641_B,02641,B,gentleness and care i d send them one and all to
p02642_B,02642,B,never mind where but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view
p02643_B,02643,B,what object
p02644_B,02644,B,simply the discovery of oliver s parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived
p02645_B,02645,B,ah i almost forgot that
p02646_B,02646,B,you see placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about
p02647_B,02647,B,hanging a few of them at least in all probability and transporting the rest
p02648_B,02648,B,very good but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interest or at least to oliver s which is the same thing
p02649_B,02649,B,then i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really
p02650_B,02650,B,do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray the promise shall be kept i don t think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself i should like to call in the aid of my friend grimwig he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves
p02651_B,02651,B,i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine
p02652_B,02652,B,we must put it to the vote who may he be
p02653_B,02653,B,that lady s son and this young lady s very old friend
p02654_B,02654,B,we stay in town of course while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains
p02655_B,02655,B,good and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate oliver s tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough come supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world
p02656_B,02656,B,it s a heavy load i can tell you
p02657_B,02657,B,heavy what are yer talking about what are yer made for oh there yer are resting again well if yer ain t enough to tire anybody s patience out i don t know what is
p02658_B,02658,B,is it much farther
p02659_B,02659,B,much farther yer as good as there look there those are the lights of london
p02660_B,02660,B,they re a good two mile off at least
p02661_B,02661,B,never mind whether they re two mile off or twenty but get up and come on or i ll kick yer and so i give yer notice

p02668_B,02668,B,well you needn t be so cross
p02669_B,02669,B,a pretty thing it would be wouldn t it to go and stop at the very first public house outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on no i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest house i can set eyes on cod yer may thanks yer stars i ve got a head for if we hadn t gone at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yer d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady and serve yer right for being a fool

p02741_B,02741,B,except sometimes some people are nobody s enemies but their own yer know
p02742_B,02742,B,don t believe that when a man s his own enemy it s only because he s too much his own friend not because he s careful for everybody but himself pooh pooh there ain t such a thing in nature
p02743_B,02743,B,there oughn t to be if there is
p02744_B,02744,B,that stands to reason some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven it s neither my friend neither it s number one
p02745_B,02745,B,ha ha number one for ever
p02746_B,02746,B,in a little community like ours my dear we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people
p02747_B,02747,B,oh the devil
p02748_B,02748,B,you see we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so for instance it s your object to take care of number one meaning yourself

p02750_B,02750,B,well you can t take care of yourself number one without taking care of me number one

p02754_B,02754,B,only think only consider you ve done what s a very pretty thing and what i love you for doing but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat that s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose in plain english the halter the gallows the gallows my dear is an ugly finger post which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow s career on the broad highway to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with you
p02755_B,02755,B,of course it is what do yer talk about such things for
p02756_B,02756,B,only to show you my meaning clearly to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the second my number one the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at first that a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company
p02757_B,02757,B,that s true oh yer a cunning old codger
p02758_B,02758,B,it s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses my best hand was taken from me yesterday morning

p02912_B,02912,B,i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in oliver s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free
p02913_B,02913,B,and if it is not
p02914_B,02914,B,then this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it

p03000_B,03000,B,i don t care for hard names you know the fact and that s enough for me
p03001_B,03001,B,but i also know the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume your mother succeeded she forgot it soon but it rusted and cankered at your father s heart for years
p03002_B,03002,B,well they were separated and what of that
p03003_B,03003,B,when they had been separated for some time and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends this circumstance at least you know already

p03010_B,03010,B,your tale is of the longest
p03011_B,03011,B,it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are often it is no uncommon case died and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefs money it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no will no will so that the whole property fell to her and you before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way he came to me
p03012_B,03012,B,i never heard of that
p03013_B,03013,B,he came to me and left with me among some other things a picture a portrait painted by himself a likeness of this poor girl which he did not wish to leave behind and could not carry forward on his hasty journey he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked in a wild distracted way of ruin and dishonour worked by himself confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition to fly the country i guessed too well he would not fly alone and never see it more even from me his old and early friend whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both even from me he withheld any more particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after that to see me once again for the last time on earth alas that was the last time i had no letter and i never saw him more i went i went when all was over to the scene of his i will use the term the world would freely use for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him of his guilty love resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her the family had left that part a week before they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the place by night why or whither none can tell when your brother when your brother a feeble ragged neglected child was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy
p03014_B,03014,B,why not

p03016_B,03016,B,you you can t prove anything against me i defy you to do it
p03017_B,03017,B,we shall see i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indies whither as you well know you retired upon your mother s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here i made the voyage you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where i returned your agents had no clue to your residence you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy i wearied them with new applications i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant
p03018_B,03018,B,and now you do see me what then fraud and robbery are high sounding words justified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man s brother you don t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you don t even know that

p03083_B,03083,B,i must have it here too
p03084_B,03084,B,listen then you his father being taken ill at rome was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with her to look after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next day when he died among the papers in his desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to yourself and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes the other a will
p03085_B,03085,B,what of the letter
p03086_B,03086,B,the letter a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery to be explained one day prevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back she was at that time within a few months of her confinement he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her prayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done before and then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted i believe he had
p03087_B,03087,B,the will the will was in the same spirit as the letter he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions one for agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and ever come of age if it were a girl it was to inherit the money unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong he did this he said to mark his confidence in the mother and his conviction only strengthened by approaching death that the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature if he were disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you for then and not till then when both children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion
p03088_B,03088,B,my mother did what a woman should have done she burnt this will the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot the girl s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate i love her for it now could add goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke
p03089_B,03089,B,years after this this man s edward leeford s mother came to me he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died inquiries were set on foot and strict searches made they were unavailing for a long time but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france
p03090_B,03090,B,there she died after a lingering illness and on her death bed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved though she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it if i could to the very gallows foot she was right he came in my way at last i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began
p03091_B,03091,B,the locket and ring

p03118_B,03118,B,no the people were poor and began to sicken at least the man did of their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promised more which she never meant to send she didn t quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the child s unhappiness but told the history of the sister s shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or other the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the girl by chance pitied her and took her home there was some cursed spell i think against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy i lost sight of her two or three years ago and saw her no more until a few months back
