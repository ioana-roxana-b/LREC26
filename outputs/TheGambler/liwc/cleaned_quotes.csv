Q0,I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette Well excuse my speaking so plainly but I know how addicted you are to gambling Though I am not your mentor nor wish to be at least I have a right to require that you shall not actually compromise me,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q1,I have no money for gambling,Alexis Ivanovitch,['The General']
Q2,But you will soon be in receipt of some,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q3,Let us calculate We must translate these roubles into thalers Here take 100 thalers as a round sum The rest will be safe in my hands,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q4,You must not be offended at what I say You are too touchy about these things What I have said I have said merely as a warning To do so is no more than my right,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q5,Why do I continue to dance attendance upon the General instead of having left him and his family long ago,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q6,If one is a man of self respect one risks abuse by so doing and is forced to put up with insults of every kind Both at Paris and on the Rhine and even in Switzerland there are so many Poles with their sympathisers the French at these tables d h te that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley']"
Q7,Of course one always learns something everywhere,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q8,In Paris too I had a dispute with a Pole and then with a French officer who supported him After that a section of the Frenchmen present took my part They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor s coffee,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley']"
Q9,To spit into it,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q10,Just so You must know that on one occasion when for two days I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris to have my passport visaed There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty and a man dry and cold of mien After listening politely but with great reserve to my account of myself this sacristan asked me to wait a little I was in a great hurry to depart but of course I sat down pulled out a copy of L Opinion Nationale and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor and then another bow as the visitor took his leave I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also whereupon with an expression of if anything increased dryness he again asked me to wait Soon a third visitor arrived who like myself had come on business he was an Austrian of some sort and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs This made me very angry I rose approached the sacristan and told him that since Monsignor was receiving callers his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor s In a tone of the utmost effrontery as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me he looked me up and down and then said But I only cried the louder screeched the sacristan again shrinking back in horror Then rushing to the door he spread out his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley']"
Q11,But,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q12,What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian Cela n tait pas si b te,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q13,But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated Why when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are Russians At all events at my hotel in Paris I received far more attention from the company after I had told them about the fracas with the sacristan A fat Polish nobleman who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te at once went upstairs while some of the Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man at whom in 1812 a French hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in Moscow,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley']"
Q14,Impossible No French soldier would fire at a child,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q15,Nevertheless the incident was as I say A very respected ex captain told me the story and I myself could see the scar left on his cheek,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Mr. Astley']"
Q16,Come what may I must have money And get it somehow I will otherwise I shall be ruined,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q17,Nothing except that two pieces of news have reached us from St Petersburg In the first place my grandmother is very ill and unlikely to last another couple of days We had this from Timothy Petrovitch himself and he is a reliable person Every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q18,All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q19,Of course all of us and every minute of the day For a year and a half now we have been looking for this,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q20,Looking for it,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q21,Yes looking for it I am not her blood relation you know I am merely the General s step daughter Yet I am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q22,Yes I believe that you will come in for a good deal,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q23,Yes for she is fond of me But how come you to think so,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q24,That Marquis of yours is he also familiar with your family secrets,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q25,And why are you yourself so interested in them,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q26,Never mind If I am not mistaken the General has succeeded in borrowing money of the Marquis,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q27,It may be so,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q28,Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother Did you notice too that three times during luncheon when speaking of her he called her La Baboulenka,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q29,What loving friendly behaviour to be sure,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q30,Yes that is true As soon as ever he learnt that I was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses I thought you ought to know that,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q31,Then he has only just begun his courting Why I thought he had been doing so a long while,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q32,You know he has not But where on earth did you pick up this Englishman,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q33,I knew you would ask about him,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q34,He is very shy and susceptible Also he is in love with you,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q35,Yes he is in love with me,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q36,And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman In fact what does the Frenchman possess To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q37,Oh no there is no doubt about it He does possess some ch teau or other Last night the General told me that for certain Now are you satisfied,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q38,Nevertheless in your place I should marry the Englishman,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q39,And why,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q40,Because though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two he is also the baser whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour but ten times the wealthier of the pair,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q41,Yes But then the Frenchman is a marquis and the cleverer of the two,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q42,Is that so,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q43,Yes absolutely,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q44,It amuses me to see you grow angry However inasmuch as I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures you ought to pay me something for the privilege,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q45,I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you for the reason that I am ready to pay for them and also care little what becomes of me,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q46,Last time you told me when on the Shlangenberg that at a word from me you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss Some day I may remind you of that saying in order to see if you will be as good as your word Yes you may depend upon it that I shall do so I hate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths and I also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me For the time being I want you so I must keep you,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q47,May I ask you who is this Mlle Blanche,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q48,You know who she is just Mlle Blanche Nothing further has transpired Probably she will soon be Madame General that is to say if the rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true Mlle Blanche with her mother and her cousin the Marquis know very well that as things now stand we are ruined,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q49,And is the General at last in love,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q50,That has nothing to do with it Listen to me Take these 700 florins and go and play roulette with them Win as much for me as you can for I am badly in need of money,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q51,Do I or do I not love her,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q52,And even if you were to win much I should be compromised Of course I have no right to order your actions but you yourself will agree that,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q53,Why not,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q54,Because I wish to play for myself That is my sole reason,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q55,Then are you so certain that your roulette playing will get us out of our difficulties,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q56,Yes,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q57,Possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous yet pray leave me in peace,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q58,I am not unwilling so to do but in all probability I should lose,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q59,Well absurd though it be I place great hopes on your playing of roulette wherefore you ought to play as my partner and on equal shares wherefore of course you will do as I wish,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q60,That Mlle Blanche Well I have seen a good many women like her,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q61,It is so,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q62,Does Mlle Polina like flowers,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q63,I really cannot say,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q64,What You cannot say,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q65,No I have never noticed whether she does so or not,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q66,Hm Then I have an idea in my mind,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q67,At all events she in her turn has promised to give me an explanation to night and to reveal to me something or another,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q68,a man ought to go more carefully,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q69,though a great many Russians go in for gambling they are no good at the game,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q70,I think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna']"
Q71,Upon what do you base your opinion,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q72,Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised Westerner there has become historically added though this is not his chief point a capacity for acquiring capital whereas not only is the Russian incapable of acquiring capital but also he exhausts it wantonly and of sheer folly None the less we Russians often need money wherefore we are glad of and greatly devoted to a method of acquisition like roulette whereby in a couple of hours one may grow rich without doing any work This method I repeat has a great attraction for us but since we play in wanton fashion and without taking any trouble we almost invariably lose,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna']"
Q73,To a certain extent that is true,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q74,Oh no it is not true,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q75,And you you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your own country,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q76,I beg pardon Yet it would be difficult to say which is the worst of the two Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing rich through honest toil,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna']"
Q77,What an extraordinary idea,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q78,And what a Russian idea,Marqis De Griers,"['The General', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q79,I would rather live a wandering life in tents than bow the knee to a German idol,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna']"
Q80,To what idol,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q81,To the German method of heaping up riches I have not been here very long but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood boil Good Lord I wish for no virtues of that kind Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts and everywhere I found that things were even as we read of them in good German picture books that every house has its Vater who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable So honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him and I cannot bear people of that sort Each such Vater has his family and in the evenings they read improving books aloud Over their roof trees there murmur elms and chestnuts the sun has sunk to his rest a stork is roosting on the gable and all is beautifully poetic and touching Do not be angry General Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that I can remember how of an evening my own father now dead used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden and to read books aloud to myself and my mother Yes I know how things ought to be done Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its Vater They work like oxen and amass wealth like Jews Suppose the Vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land Well one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry and so leave her among the unwedded For the same reason the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army in order that he may earn more towards the family capital Yes such things ARE done for I have been making inquiries on the subject It is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been rightly sold and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge What more have I to tell Well this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound but he cannot marry her for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden So the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while Gretchen s cheeks grow sunken and she begins to wither until at last after some twenty years their substance has multiplied and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated Then the Vater blesses his forty year old heir and the thirty five year old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose after which he bursts into tears reads the pair a lesson on morality and dies In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous Vater and the old story begins again In fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original Vater will have amassed a considerable sum and that sum he will hand over to his son and the latter to his son and so on for several generations until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild or a Hoppe and Company or the devil knows what Is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour patience intellect rectitude character perseverance and calculation with a stork sitting on the roof above it all What is more they think there can never be anything better than this wherefore from their point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world and to censure all who are at fault that is to say who are not exactly like themselves Yes there you have it in a nutshell For my own part I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner or squander my whole substance at roulette I have no wish to be Hoppe and Company at the end of five generations I want the money for myself for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to or meet to be given over to capital I may be wrong but there you have it Those are my views,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna']"
Q82,How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know but I do know that you are becoming an insufferable far eur whenever you are given the least chance,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Polina Alexandrovna', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q83,Because he is a brute,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q84,Have you noticed too that today he is by no means on good terms with the General,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q85,Yes and I suppose you want to know why You are aware are you not that the General is mortgaged to the Marquis with all his property Consequently if the General s mother does not die the Frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q86,Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged I have heard rumours to that effect but was unaware how far they might be true,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q87,Yes they are true What then,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q88,Why it will be a case of Farewell Mlle Blanche for in such an event she would never become Madame General Do you know I believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over At his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q89,Yes something I believe will happen to him,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q90,And what a fine thing it all is Could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone Not one of the decencies has been observed the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony And as for the grandmother what could be more comical yet more dastardly than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead What do you think of it Polina Alexandrovna,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q91,Yes it is very horrible Consequently I am the more surprised that you should be so cheerful What are you so pleased about About the fact that you have gone and lost my money,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q92,What The money that you gave me to lose I told you I should never win for other people least of all for you I obeyed you simply because you ordered me to but you must not blame me for the result I warned you that no good would ever come of it You seem much depressed at having lost your money Why do you need it so greatly,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q93,Why do you ask me these questions,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q94,Because you promised to explain matters to me Listen I am certain that as soon as ever I begin to play for myself and I still have 120 g lden left I shall win You can then take of me what you require,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q95,You must not be angry with me for making such a proposal I am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me A gift from me could not possibly offend you Moreover it was I who lost your g lden,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q96,My affairs cannot possibly interest you Still if you do wish to know I am in debt I borrowed some money and must pay it back again I have a curious senseless idea that I am bound to win at the gaming tables Why I think so I cannot tell but I do think so and with some assurance Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now find myself without any other resource,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q97,Or perhaps it is because it is so necessary for you to win It is like a drowning man catching at a straw You yourself will agree that unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q98,What Do not you also hope something from it Did you not tell me again and again two weeks ago that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here And did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so Were you joking You cannot have been for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q99,True I always felt certain that I should win Indeed what you say makes me ask myself Why have my absurd senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind Yet I am still positive that so soon as ever I begin to play for myself I shall infallibly win,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q100,And why are you so certain,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q101,To tell the truth I do not know I only know that I must win that it is the one resource I have left Yes why do I feel so assured on the point,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q102,Perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q103,Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q104,I do not care whether you are so or not Well since you ask me I do doubt your ability to take anything seriously You are capable of worrying but not deeply You are too ill regulated and unsettled a person for that But why do you want money Not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q105,By the way you say you want to pay off a debt It must be a large one Is it to the Frenchman,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q106,What do you mean by asking all these questions You are very clever today Surely you are not drunk,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q107,You know that you and I stand on no ceremony and that sometimes I put to you very plain questions I repeat that I am your slave and slaves cannot be shamed or offended,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q108,You talk like a child It is always possible to comport oneself with dignity If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q109,A maxim straight from the copybook Suppose I cannot comport myself with dignity By that I mean that though I am a man of self respect I am unable to carry off a situation properly Do you know the reason It is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression It is all a question of mode Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists It belongs only to the French though a few other Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity and yet be wholly undignified persons That is why with us the mode is so all important The Frenchman may receive an insult a real a venomous insult yet he will not so much as frown But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted of the time hallowed order of decorum That is why our good ladies are so fond of Frenchmen the Frenchman s manners they say are perfect But in my opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman s manners The Frenchman is only a bird the coq gaulois At the same time as I am not a woman I do not properly understand the question Cocks may be excellent birds If I am wrong you must stop me You ought to stop and correct me more often when I am speaking to you for I am too apt to say everything that is in my head,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q110,You see I have lost my manners I agree that I have none nor yet any dignity I will tell you why I set no store upon such things Everything in me has undergone a cheek You know the reason I have not a single human thought in my head For a long while I have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in Russia I have been to Dresden yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is like You know the cause of my obsession I have no hope now and am a mere cipher in your eyes wherefore I tell you outright that wherever I go I see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q111,Why or how I have come to love you I do not know It may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon Do you know I am ignorant even as to what your face is like In all probability too your heart is not comely and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q112,And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q113,When have I thought to do so,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q114,You are losing the thread of the argument If you do not wish to purchase me at all events you wish to purchase my respect,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q115,Not at all I have told you that I find it difficult to explain myself You are hard upon me Do not be angry at my chattering You know why you ought not to be angry with me that I am simply an imbecile However I do not mind if you are angry Sitting in my room I need but to think of you to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress and at once I fall almost to biting my hands Why should you be angry with me Because I call myself your slave Revel I pray you in my slavery revel in it Do you know that sometimes I could kill you not because I do not love you or am jealous of you but because I feel as though I could simply devour you You are laughing,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q116,No I am not But I order you nevertheless to be silent,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q117,What rubbish,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q118,I do not care Also do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you to disfigure you to strangle you Are you certain that it will never come to that You are driving me to frenzy Am I afraid of a scandal or of your anger Why should I fear your anger I love without hope and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand times more If ever I should kill you I should have to kill myself too But I shall put off doing so as long as possible for I wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me Do you know a very strange thing It is that with every day my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility Why should I not become a fatalist Remember how on the third day that we ascended the Shlangenberg I was moved to whisper in your ear Had you said it I should have leapt Do you not believe me,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q119,What stupid rubbish,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q120,I care not whether it be wise or stupid I only know that in your presence I must speak speak speak Therefore I am speaking I lose all conceit when I am with you and everything ceases to matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q121,Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg That would have been of no use to me,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q122,Splendid I know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me I can see through you Of no use did you say Why to give pleasure is always of use and as for barbarous unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why it is a kind of luxury Man is a despot by nature and loves to torture You in particular love to do so,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q123,Oh no Why so I believe you,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q124,Surely you are not a coward,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q125,I do not know Perhaps I am but I do not know I have long given up thinking about such things,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q126,If I said to you Kill that man would you kill him,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q127,Whom,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q128,Whomsoever I wish,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q129,The Frenchman,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q130,Do not ask me questions return me answers I repeat whomsoever I wish I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q131,Do you rather tell me what is going on here Why do you seem half afraid of me I can see for myself what is wrong You are the step daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a Blanche And there is this Frenchman too with his mysterious influence over you Yet you actually ask me such a question If you do not tell me how things stand I shall have to put in my oar and do something Are you ashamed to be frank with me Are you shy of me,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q132,I am not going to talk to you on that subject I have asked you a question and am waiting for an answer,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q133,Well then I will kill whomsoever you wish But are you really going to bid me do such deeds,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q134,Why should you think that I am going to let you off I shall bid you do it or else renounce me Could you ever do the latter No you know that you couldn t You would first kill whom I had bidden you and then kill me for having dared to send you away,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q135,Do you see that fat Baroness It is the Baroness Burmergelm She arrived three days ago Just look at her husband that tall wizened Prussian there with the stick in his hand Do you remember how he stared at us the other day Well go to the Baroness take off your hat to her and say something in French,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q136,Why,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q137,Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill Well instead of such murders and tragedies I wish only for a good laugh Go without answering me and let me see the Baron give you a sound thrashing with his stick,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q138,Then you throw me out a challenge you think that I will not do it,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q139,Yes I do challenge you Go for such is my will,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q140,Then I will go however mad be your fancy Only look here shall you not be doing the General a great disservice as well as through him a great disservice to yourself It is not about myself I am worrying it is about you and the General Why for a mere fancy should I go and insult a woman,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q141,Ah Then I can see that you are only a trifler Your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon Do I not know that what I have asked you to do is foolish and wrong and that the General will be angry about it But I want to have a good laugh all the same I want that and nothing else Why should you insult a woman indeed Well you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']

Q146,Sind Sie rasend,The Baron,"['Baroness Burmergelm', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q147,Ja wo o ohl,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['Baroness Burmergelm', 'The Baron']"
Q148,I have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Polina Alexandrovna']
Q149,Have you Then you can take the consequences,Polina Alexandrovna,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q150,My good sir may I ask you what this is that you have gone and done,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q151,I should be glad if we could come straight to the point Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q152,With a German Why the German was the Baron Burmergelm a most important personage I hear that you have been rude both to him and to the Baroness,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q153,No I have not,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q154,But I understand that you simply terrified them my good sir,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q155,Not in the least You must know that when I was in Berlin I frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat and repellently prolong a certain phrase namely and happening to meet this couple in the carriage drive I found for some reason or another that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits Moreover on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot Not unnaturally I too possess a measure of self respect wherefore on this occasion I took off my hat and said politely yes I assure you it was said politely Then the Baron turned round and said whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in answer Twice I shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable That is all,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q156,You are only making fun of me,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q157,Do not think that It was not so at all I grant you that my behaviour was bad I fully confess that it was so and make no secret of the fact I would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery but more than that it was not Also let me tell you that I am very sorry for my conduct Yet there is one circumstance which in my eyes almost absolves me from regret in the matter Of late that is to say for the last two or three weeks I have been feeling not at all well That is to say I have been in a sick nervous irritable fanciful condition so that I have periodically lost control over myself For instance on more than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with Monsieur le Marquise here and under the circumstances he had no choice but to answer me In short I have recently been showing signs of ill health Whether the Baroness Burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when I come to beg her pardon for I do intend to make her amends I do not know but I doubt if she will and the less so since so far as I know the circumstance is one which of late has begun to be abused in the legal world in that advocates in criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that at the moment of the crime they the clients were unconscious of what they were doing that in short they were out of health My client committed the murder that is true but he has no recollection of having committed it And doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a malady that there really can arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given deed or only a half or a quarter of it But the Baron and Baroness are members of an older generation as well as Prussian Junkers and landowners To them such a process in the medico judicial world will be unknown and therefore they are the more unlikely to accept any such explanation What is your opinion about it General,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q158,Enough sir Enough I say Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness will be impossible Any intercourse with you even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons they would look upon as a degradation I may tell you that on learning that you formed part of my household the Baron approached me in the Casino and demanded of me additional satisfaction Do you understand then what it is that you have entailed upon me upon me my good sir You have entailed upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q159,Excuse me General but did he make an express point of it that I should cease to belong to your establishment as you call it,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q160,No I of my own initiative thought that I ought to afford him that satisfaction and with it he was satisfied So we must part good sir It is my duty to hand over to you forty g lden three florins as per the accompanying statement Here is the money and here the account which you are at liberty to verify Farewell From henceforth we are strangers From you I have never had anything but trouble and unpleasantness I am about to call the landlord and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards I shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expenses Also I have the honour to remain your obedient servant,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q161,The matter cannot end here I regret very much that you should have been put to unpleasantness at the Baron s hands but the fault pardon me is your own How came you to answer for me to the Baron And what did you mean by saying that I formed part of your household I am merely your family tutor not a son of yours nor yet your ward nor a person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible I am a judicially competent person a man of twenty five years of age a university graduate a gentleman and until I met yourself a complete stranger to you Only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands as well as a further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon yourself to answer for my conduct,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q162,Nor do I intend to let the Baron off And since you General have today been so good as to listen to the Baron s complaints and to enter into his concerns since you have made yourself a participator in the affair I have the honour to inform you that tomorrow morning at the latest I shall in my own name demand of the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person as though I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q163,What Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense Do you not realise the harm that it is doing me I beg of you not to laugh at me sir not to laugh at me for we have police authorities here who out of respect for my rank and for that of the Baron In short sir I swear to you that I will have you arrested and marched out of the place to prevent any further brawling on your part Do you understand what I say,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q164,General one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled I have not so much as begun my explanations to the Baron and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is to me a shameful supposition namely that I am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will It is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself,Alexis Ivanovitch,"['The General', 'Marqis De Griers']"
Q165,For God s sake Alexis Ivanovitch do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours Do you know what is likely to come of it Merely further unpleasantness You will agree with me I am sure that at present I ought to move with especial care yes with very especial care You cannot be fully aware of how I am situated When we leave this place I shall be ready to receive you back into my household but for the time being I Well I cannot tell you all my reasons,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q166,O Alexis Ivanovitch Alexis Ivanovitch,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q167,move with especial care at present,The General,"['Marqis De Griers', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q168,I have come to see you on business nor will I seek to conceal from you the fact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary of an intermediary from the General Having small knowledge of the Russian tongue I lost most of what was said last night but the General has now explained matters and I must confess that,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q169,See here Monsieur de Griers I understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary Of course I am only un utchitel a tutor and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it Consequently I do not know the whole of its circumstances Yet pray explain to me this have you yourself become one of its members seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything and are now present as an intermediary,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q170,I am connected with the General partly through business affairs and partly through special circumstances My principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening What you contemplate is I have no doubt very clever yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end since not only will the Baron refuse to receive you but also he the Baron has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you Surely you can see that yourself What then would be the good of going on with it all On the other hand the General promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household and in the meantime will credit you with your salary with vos appointements Surely that will suit you will it not,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q171,Good heavens Seeing that the General takes such an interest in the matter is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q172,In short my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q173,Oh fie What refinements and subtleties Besides what have you to express regret for Confess Monsieur Monsieur pardon me but I have forgotten your name confess I say that all this is merely a plan to annoy the General Or perhaps you have some other and special end in view Eh,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q174,In return you must pardon me mon cher Marquis and tell me what you have to do with it,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q175,The General,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q176,But what of the General Last night he said that for some reason or another it behoved him to move with especial care at present wherefore he was feeling nervous But I did not understand the reference,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q177,Yes there do exist special reasons for his doing so You are acquainted with Mlle de Cominges are you not,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q178,Mlle Blanche you mean,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q179,Yes Mlle Blanche de Cominges Doubtless you know also that the General is in love with this young lady and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here Imagine therefore what any scene or scandal would entail upon him,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q180,I cannot see that the marriage scheme need be affected by scenes or scandals,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q181,Mais le Baron est si irascible un caract re prussien vous savez Enfin il fera une querelle d Allemand,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q182,I do not care seeing that I no longer belong to his household But is it quite settled that Mlle is to marry the General What are they waiting for Why should they conceal such a matter at all events from ourselves the General s own party,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q183,I cannot tell you The marriage is not yet a settled affair for they are awaiting news from Russia The General has business transactions to arrange,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q184,Ah Connected doubtless with madame his mother,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q185,To cut things short I have complete confidence in your native politeness as well as in your tact and good sense I feel sure that you will do what I suggest even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q186,Be so good as to observe that the same family has just expelled me from its bosom All that you are saying you are saying but for show but when people have just said to you Of course we do not wish to turn you out yet for the sake of appearance s you must permit yourself to be turned out nothing can matter very much,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q187,Very well then Seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you it is my duty to mention that other measures will be taken There exist here police you must remember and this very day they shall send you packing Que diable To think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging a person like the Baron to a duel Do you suppose that you will be allowed to do such things Just try doing them and see if any one will be afraid of you The reason why I have asked you to desist is that I can see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance Do you believe that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q188,Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors You are labouring under a delusion Monsieur de Griers The thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine I was just about to start for Mr Astley s to ask him to be my intermediary in other words my second He has a strong liking for me and I do not think that he will refuse He will go and see the Baron on MY behalf and the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him Although I am only a tutor a kind of subaltern Mr Astley is known to all men as the nephew of a real English lord the Lord Piebroch as well as a lord in his own right Yes you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil to Mr Astley and listen to him Or should he decline to do so Mr Astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself for you know how persistent the English are and thereupon introduce to the Baron a friend of his own and he has many friends in a good position That being so picture to yourself the issue of the affair an affair which will not quite end as you think it will,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q189,Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop One would think that it actually pleased you to have scenes Indeed it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are seeking I have said that the affair may prove to be diverting and even clever and that possibly you may attain something by it yet none the less I tell you that I have come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person Read them please for I must take her back an answer,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q190,Very well,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q191,you can tell Mlle not to disturb herself But I would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note Instead of chattering about trifles you ought to have delivered me the missive at once if you have really come commissioned as you say,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q192,Well pardon some natural haste on my part for the situation is so strange I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions and moreover I did not know the contents of the note and thought that it could be given you at any time,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q193,I understand So you were ordered to hand me the note only in the last resort and if you could not otherwise appease me Is it not so Speak out Monsieur de Griers,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Marqis De Griers']
Q194,Perhaps,Marqis De Griers,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q195,You and I are to have a reckoning later Master Frenchman Yes we will measure our strength together,Alexis Ivanovitch,[]
Q196,I was just coming to see you and you appear to be out on a similar errand So you have parted with your employers,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q197,How do you know that Is every one aware of the fact,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q198,By no means Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment Indeed I have never heard any one speak of it,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q199,Then how come you to know it,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q200,Because I have had occasion to do so Whither are you bound I like you and was therefore coming to pay you a visit,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q201,What a splendid fellow you are Mr Astley And since I have not yet had my coffee and you have in all probability scarcely tasted yours let us adjourn to the Casino Caf where we can sit and smoke and have a talk,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q202,I do not intend to go away I intend on the contrary to remain here,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q203,That I never doubted,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q204,No I fear not,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q205,And concerning this Marquis and Mlle Polina you know nothing beyond surmise,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q206,No I know nothing for certain about them No nothing,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q207,Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me or even to imagine things about them,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q208,Quite so quite so I admit that Yet that is not the question,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q209,What do you make of it When I met you I was just coming to ask you your opinion For myself I could have killed this Frenchman and am not sure that I shall not do so even yet,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q210,I feel the same about it As for Mlle Polina well you yourself know that if necessity drives one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests Even between this couple there may be something which though unknown to you depends upon extraneous circumstances For my own part I think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially And as for Mlle Polina s proceedings of two days ago they were of course strange not because she can have meant to get rid of you or to earn for you a thrashing from the Baron s cudgel which for some curious reason he did not use although he had it ready in his hands but because such proceedings on the part of such well of such a refined lady as Mlle Polina are to say the least of it unbecoming But she cannot have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q211,Do you know what I believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from Mlle Polina herself,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q212,Your eyes look very fiery and in them I can read suspicion Now you have no right whatever to be suspicious It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise and I absolutely refuse to answer your questions,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q213,Enough You need say no more,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q214,Very well very well Then I stand confounded and have no further opinions to offer But you are a good fellow and I am glad to know what you think about it all even though I do not need your advice,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q215,For instance what reason should you assign for the General taking fright in this way Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident Even De Griers has found it necessary to put in his oar and he only interferes on the most important occasions and to visit me and to address to me the most earnest supplications Yes he De Griers has actually been playing the suppliant to me And mark you although he came to me as early as nine o clock he had ready prepared in his hand Mlle Polina s note When I would ask was that note written Mlle Polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it At all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon Yet what is her personal concern in the matter Why is she interested in it at all Why too is the whole party so afraid of this precious Baron And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be going to marry Mlle Blanche de Cominges He told me last night that because of the circumstance he must move with especial care at present What is your opinion of it all Your look convinces me that you know more about it than I do,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q216,Yes I think I do know more about it than you do The affair centres around this Mlle Blanche Of that I feel certain,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q217,And what of Mlle Blanche,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q218,Well my belief is that at the present moment Mlle Blanche has in very truth a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the Baron and the Baroness It might lead not only to some unpleasantness but even to a scandal,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q219,Oh oh,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q220,Also I may tell you that Mlle Blanche has been in Roulettenberg before for she was staying here three seasons ago I myself was in the place at the time and in those days Mlle Blanche was not known as Mlle de Cominges nor was her mother the Widow de Cominges even in existence In any case no one ever mentioned the latter De Griers too had not materialised and I am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance Likewise the Marquisate de Griers is of recent creation Of that I have reason to be sure owing to a certain circumstance Even the name De Griers itself may be taken to be a new invention seeing that I have a friend who once met the said Marquis under a different name altogether,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q221,Yet he possesses a good circle of friends,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q222,Possibly Mlle Blanche also may possess that Yet it is not three years since she received from the local police at the instance of the Baroness an invitation to leave the town And she left it,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q223,But why,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q224,Well I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an Italian a prince of some sort a man who bore an historic name Barberini or something of the kind The fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage At first Mlle Blanche played trente et quarante with fair success but later her luck took a marked change for the worse I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum But worse was to ensue for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses carriage and all Also the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous Upon this Mlle Zelma the name which she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini was in despair She shrieked and howled all over the hotel and even tore her clothes in her frenzy In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count you must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts and the spectacle of Mlle Zelma tearing her clothes and catlike scratching her face with her beautiful scented nails produced upon him a strong impression So the pair had a talk together and by luncheon time she was consoled Indeed that evening the couple entered the Casino arm in arm Mlle Zelma laughing loudly according to her custom and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown For instance she thrust her way into the file of women roulette players in the exact fashion of those ladies who to clear a space for themselves at the tables push their fellow players roughly aside Doubtless you have noticed them,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q225,Yes certainly,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q226,Well they are not worth noticing To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables though as soon as ever these women cease to do so they receive an invitation to depart However Mlle Zelma continued to change notes of this kind but her play grew more and more unsuccessful despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal Suddenly the Count too disappeared even as the Prince had done and that same evening Mlle Zelma was forced to appear in the Casino alone On this occasion no one offered her a greeting Two days later she had come to the end of her resources whereupon after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval To his distaste however Mlle paid no attention but turning to him with her well known smile requested him to stake on her behalf ten louis on the red Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request Mlle not to re enter the Casino If you feel in any way surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details the reason is that I had them from a relative of mine who later that evening drove Mlle Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa Now mark you Mlle wants to become Madame General in order that in future she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years ago At present she is not playing but that is only because according to the signs she is lending money to other players Yes that is a much more paying game I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt as well as perhaps also De Griers Or it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her Consequently you yourself will see that until the marriage shall have been consummated Mlle would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself In short to any one in her position a scandal would be most detrimental You form a member of the m nage of these people wherefore any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle Polina Now do you understand,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q227,No I do not Tell me Mr Astley why if you knew this history all along and consequently always knew who this Mlle Blanche is you never warned either myself or the General nor most of all Mlle Polina How could you do it,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q228,It would have done no good to warn you for the reason that you could have effected nothing Against what was I to warn you As likely as not the General knows more about Mlle Blanche even than I do yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle Polina Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding splendidly mounted with De Griers while the General was careering in their wake on a roan horse He had said that morning that his legs were hurting him yet his riding seat was easy enough As he passed I looked at him and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever However it is no affair of mine for I have only recently had the happiness to make Mlle Polina s acquaintance Also I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions however sincere be my liking for you,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q229,Enough To me it is as clear as day that Mlle Polina knows all about this Mlle Blanche but cannot bring herself to part with her Frenchman wherefore she consents also to be seen in public with Mlle Blanche You may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the Baron Yes it is there that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow Yet she herself it was who launched me at the Baron The devil take it but I was left no choice in the matter,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q230,You forget in the first place that this Mlle de Cominges is the General s inamorata and in the second place that Mlle Polina the General s step daughter has a younger brother and sister who though they are the General s own children are completely neglected by this madman and robbed as well,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q231,Yes yes that is so For me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment whereas if I remain I should be able to defend their interests and perhaps to save a moiety of their property Yes yes that is quite true And yet and yet Oh I can well understand why they are all so interested in the General s mother,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q232,In whom,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q233,In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q234,Ah then of course their interests centre around her It is a question of succession Let that but be settled and the General will marry Mlle Polina will be set free and De Griers,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q235,Yes and De Griers,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q236,Will be repaid his money which is what he is now waiting for,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q237,What You think that he is waiting for that,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q238,I know of nothing else,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q239,But I do I do He is waiting also for the old woman s will for the reason that it awards Mlle Polina a dowry As soon as ever the money is received she will throw herself upon the Frenchman s neck All women are like that Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned What Polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love That is my opinion Look at her especially when she is sitting alone and plunged in thought All this was pre ordained and foretold and is accursed Polina could perpetrate any mad act She she But who called me by name Who is shouting for me I heard some one calling in Russian It was a woman s voice Listen,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q240,Yes I did hear a woman s voice calling but whose I do not know The someone was calling you in Russian Ah NOW I can see whence the cries come They come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys Behind her see that pile of luggage She must have arrived by train,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q241,But why should she be calling me Hear her calling again See She is beckoning to us,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q242,Yes so she is,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q243,Alexis Ivanovitch Alexis Ivanovitch Good heavens what a stupid fellow,Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha,"['Mr. Astley', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"
Q244,And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after making her will Yet she will outlive us and every one else in the hotel Good Lord what is going to become of us now What on earth is to happen to the General She will turn the place upside down,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q245,My good sir what are you standing there for with your eyes almost falling out of your head Cannot you come and say how do you do Are you too proud to shake hands Or do you not recognise me Here Potapitch Just think Alexis Ivanovitch does not recognise me They have buried me for good and all Yes and after sending hosts of telegrams to know if I were dead or not Yes yes I have heard the whole story I am very much alive though as you may see,Antonida Vassilievna Tarassevitcha,"['Mr. Astley', 'Potapitch', 'Alexis Ivanovitch']"

Q699,No Why should I be You are wise to provide yourself with what you need for it will all come in handy in the future Yes I quite see the necessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis for without it you will never earn your million My hundred thousand francs I look upon merely as a beginning as a mere drop in the bucket,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mlle. Blanche']
Q700,Well well what a man you are Mais tu as l esprit pour comprendre Sais tu mon gar on although you are a tutor you ought to have been born a prince Are you not sorry that your money should be going so quickly,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']

Q706,Oh oh Mais tu es,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q707,Yes you are lying right enough But what makes you suppose that I should be angry Rubbish Il faut que jeunesse se passe Even if that officer were here now I should refrain from putting him out of the room if I thought you really cared for him Only mind you do not give him any of my money You hear,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mlle. Blanche']

Q715,He has ruined me He has robbed me and cut my throat For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me For months at a time he never left me in my dreams Do not speak of him again,The General,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q716,Il a de la chance for the Grandmother is now really ill and therefore bound to die Mr Astley has just sent a telegram to say so and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her heir Even if he should not be so he will not come amiss since in the first place he has his pension and in the second place he will be content to live in a back room whereas I shall be Madame General and get into a good circle of society and become a Russian ch telaine Yes I shall have a mansion of my own and peasants and a million of money at my back,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q717,But suppose he should prove jealous He might demand all sorts of things you know Do you follow me,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mlle. Blanche']
Q718,Oh dear no How ridiculous that would be of him Besides I have taken measures to prevent it You need not be alarmed That is to say I have induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert s name Consequently at any time I could get him punished Isn t he ridiculous,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q719,Very well then Marry him,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mlle. Blanche']
Q720,Il est pourtant tr s comme il faut,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q721,Mlle Blanche du Placet Mlle Blanche du Placet du Placet,The General,['The General']
Q722,I must behave altogether differently Yet mark you there is a tiresome circumstance of which I had never before thought which is how best to pronounce my new family name Zagorianski Zagozianski Madame la G n rale de Sago Madame la G n rale de Fourteen Consonants oh these infernal Russian names The last of them would be the best to use don t you think,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']

Q724,Attends,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q725,They may come in handy for you for though you are a very learned tutor you are a very stupid man More than two thousand francs however I am not going to give you for the reason that if I did so you would gamble them all away Now good bye Nous serons toujours bons amis and if you win again do not fail to come to me et tu seras heureux,Mlle. Blanche,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q726,You here Well I had an idea that I should meet you Do not trouble to tell me anything for I know all yes all In fact your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q727,How closely you watch the doings of your old friends That does you infinite credit But stop a moment You have reminded me of something Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when I was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden someone did so,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q728,Oh dear no though I knew all the time that you were lying there,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q729,Perhaps you could tell me who did bail me out,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q730,No I am afraid I could not,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q731,What a strange thing For I know no Russians at all here so it cannot have been a Russian who befriended me In Russia we Orthodox folk do go bail for one another but in this case I thought it must have been done by some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q732,Well I am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit as well as your buoyancy,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q733,Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than I am,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q734,Your remarks please me as they always did In those words I see the clever triumphant and above all things cynical friend of former days Only Russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities Yes most men love to see their best friend in abasement for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded All thinking persons know that ancient truth Yet on the present occasion I assure you I am sincerely glad to see that you are not cast down Tell me are you never going to give up gambling,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q735,Damn the gambling Yes I should certainly have given it up were it not that,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q736,That you are losing I thought so You need not tell me any more I know how things stand for you have said that last in despair and therefore truthfully Have you no other employment than gambling,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q737,No none whatever,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q738,You are growing blas You have not only renounced life with its interests and social ties but the duties of a citizen and a man you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have had and every aim in life but that of winning money but you have also renounced your memory Though I can remember you in the strong ardent period of your life I feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair impair rouge noir the twelve middle numbers and so forth,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q739,Enough Mr Astley Kindly do not recall to me any more recollections for I can remember things for myself Only for a time have I put them out of my head Only until I shall have rehabilitated myself am I keeping my memory dulled When that hour shall come you will see me arise from the dead,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q740,Then you will have to be here another ten years Should I then be alive I will remind you here on this very bench of what I have just said In fact I will bet you a wager that I shall do so,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q741,Say no more And to show you that I have not wholly forgotten the past may I enquire where Mlle Polina is If it was not you who bailed me out of prison it must have been she Yet never have I heard a word concerning her,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q742,No I do not think it was she At the present moment she is in Switzerland and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q743,Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q744,Mlle Polina Is the best of all possible living beings but I repeat that I shall thank you to cease questioning me about her You never really knew her and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q745,Indeed On what subject then have I a better right to speak to you than on this With it are bound up all your recollections and mine However do not be alarmed I have no wish to probe too far into your private your secret affairs My interest in Mlle Polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings About them you could tell me in two words,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q746,Well on condition that the matter shall end there I will tell you that for a long time Mlle Polina was ill and still is so My mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of England and thereafter Mlle Polina s grandmother you remember the mad old woman died and left Mlle Polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling That was about six months ago and now Mlle is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married Mlle s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother s will and are now being educated in London As for the General he died in Paris last month of a stroke Mlle Blanche did well by him for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother That I think concludes all that I have to tell,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q747,And De Griers Is he too travelling in Switzerland,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q748,No nor do I know where he is Also I warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q749,What In spite of our old friendship,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q750,Yes in spite of our old friendship,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q751,Then I beg your pardon a thousand times Mr Astley I meant nothing offensive to Mlle Polina for I have nothing of which to accuse her Moreover the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss nor even attempt to understand,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q752,If you do not care to hear their names coupled together may I ask you what you mean by the expressions and there being anything between them Why do you call them so particularly a Frenchman and a Russian lady,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q753,Ah I see you are interested Mr Astley But it is a long long story and calls for a lengthy preface At the same time the question is an important one however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance A Frenchman Mr Astley is merely a fine figure of a man With this you as a Britisher may not agree With it I also as a Russian may not agree out of envy Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion For instance one may look upon Racine as a broken down hobbledehoy perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him and I too may think him the same as well as in some respects a subject for ridicule Yet about him Mr Astley there is a certain charm and above all things he is a great poet though one might like to deny it Yes the Frenchman the Parisian as a national figure was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage and now every whipper snapper of a Parisian may possess manners methods of expression and even thoughts that are above reproach in form while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners and the rest having come to him through inheritance Yes taken by himself the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains Per contra there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart for he has an imposing figure Mr Astley and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him And even though it may offend you I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it and are always eager to cultivate the same But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women especially by our younger ladies At all events they need more experience For instance this Mlle Polina pardon me but the name has passed my lips and I cannot well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers She may respect you she may become your friend she may open out her heart to you yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain that mean and petty usurer De Griers This will be due to obstinacy and self love to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General and although these transactions of his have since been exposed you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind Only give her the De Griers of former days and she will ask of you no more The more she may detest the present De Griers the more will she lament the De Griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination You are a sugar refiner Mr Astley are you not,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q754,Yes I belong to the well known firm of Lovell and Co,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q755,Then see here On the one hand you are a sugar refiner while on the other hand you are an Apollo Belvedere But the two characters do not mix with one another I again am not even a sugar refiner I am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey Of this fact Mlle Polina is probably well aware since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q756,You are saying this because you are feeling bitter Yet there is not the least originality in your words,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q757,I agree But therein lies the horror of it all that how trepidation playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be they are none the less true But I am only wasting words,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q758,Yes you are for you are only talking nonsense,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q759,Are you aware that wretched ignoble petty unfortunate man though you are it was at her request I came to Homburg in order to see you and to have a long serious talk with you and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes and your recollections of her too,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q760,Indeed Is that really so,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q761,Yes poor unfortunate She did love you and I may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost Even if I were also to tell you that she still loves you you would none the less have to remain where you are Yes you have ruined yourself beyond redemption Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent and you were of a lively disposition and your good looks were not to be despised You might even have been useful to your country which needs men like you Yet you remained here and your life is now over I am not blaming you for this in my view all Russians resemble you or are inclined to do so If it is not roulette then it is something else The exceptions are very rare Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game Hitherto you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief but what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think Now good bye You are in want of money I suppose Then take these ten louis d or More I shall not give you for you would only gamble it away Take care of these coins and farewell Once more take care of them,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q762,No Mr Astley After all that has been said I,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q763,Take care of them I am certain you are still a gentleman and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another Also if I could be certain that you would leave both Homburg and the gaming tables and return to your own country I would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh but I give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other Take the money therefore and good bye,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q764,Yes I will take it if at the same time you will embrace me,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Mr. Astley']
Q765,With pleasure,Mr. Astley,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
Q766,Perhaps I shall need it for a meal,Alexis Ivanovitch,['Alexis Ivanovitch']
