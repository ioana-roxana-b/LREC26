p00003_A,00003,A,i ll explain to you then why you wouldn t paper a room with representations of horses do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality in fact do you of course no why then you are not to see anywhere what you don t see in fact you are not to have anywhere what you don t have in fact what is called taste is only another name for fact this is a new principle a discovery a great discovery now i ll try you again suppose you were going to carpet a room would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it girl number twenty so you would carpet your room or your husband s room if you were a grown woman and had a husband with representations of flowers would you why would you
p00004_A,00004,A,it wouldn t hurt them sir they wouldn t crush and wither if you please sir they would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant and i would fancy
p00005_A,00005,A,you are to be in all things regulated and governed by fact we hope to have before long a board of fact composed of commissioners of fact who will force the people to be a people of fact and of nothing but fact you must discard the word fancy altogether you have nothing to do with it you are not to have in any object of use or ornament what would be a contradiction in fact you don t walk upon flowers in fact you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets you don t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery you never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls you must use for all these purposes combinations and modifications in primary colours of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration this is the new discovery this is fact this is taste now if mr m choakumchild will proceed to give his first lesson here mr gradgrind i shall be happy at your request to observe his mode of procedure

p00111_A,00111,A,i am afraid you are mercenary tom
p00112_A,00112,A,have you so proved it to be a failing of mine tom
p00113_A,00113,A,i suppose it might
p00114_A,00114,A,here s tom gradgrind s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been if you don t dropped sir as if she was shot when i told her never knew her do such a thing before does her credit under the circumstances in my opinion why i am going to tell you if you hadn t been so mighty particular about the sum i should have begun to tell you before you know this lady for she is a lady mrs sparsit
p00115_A,00115,A,very well and this young man bitzer you saw him too on the same occasion
p00116_A,00116,A,very well they live at the bank you know they live at the bank perhaps very well yesterday afternoon at the close of business hours everything was put away as usual in the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of there was never mind how much in the little safe in young tom s closet the safe used for petty purposes there was a hundred and fifty odd pound
p00117_A,00117,A,a hundred and fifty four seven one
p00118_A,00118,A,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00119_A,00119,A,i hope not our friend blackpot
p00120_A,00120,A,yes sir he certainly did so though i do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points more foolish if the term is preferred than they might have been if i had always occupied my present position
p00121_A,00121,A,of course they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law as notice boards observe and serve them right fellows who go in for banks must take the consequences if there were no consequences we should all go in for banks
p00122_A,00122,A,for the present loo bounderby here s mrs sparsit to look after mrs sparsit s nerves have been acted upon by this business and she ll stay here a day or two so make her comfortable
p00123_A,00123,A,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00124_A,00124,A,the more s the pity sir you are losing all your good old habits cheer up sir if miss gradgrind will permit me i will offer to make it for you as i have often done
p00125_A,00125,A,your health ma am
p00126_A,00126,A,it used to be considered that miss gradgrind was wanting in animation but i confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect ay and indeed here is mr bounderby how do you find yourself this morning sir pray let us see you cheerful sir you want your breakfast sir but i dare say miss gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table
p00127_A,00127,A,if i waited to be taken care of by my wife ma am i believe you know pretty well i should wait till doomsday so i ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot
p00128_A,00128,A,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00129_A,00129,A,have nothing otherwise don t you loo bounderby know thoroughly well that i josiah bounderby of coketown would have it
p00130_A,00130,A,you are incomprehensible this morning pray take no further trouble to explain yourself i am not curious to know your meaning what does it matter
p00131_A,00131,A,what do you mean ma am
p00132_A,00132,A,for you louisa
p00133_A,00133,A,oh no louisa it was done before i came it was
p00134_A,00134,A,o my child my child i am an unhappy man to see you thus what avails it to me that you do not reproach me if i so bitterly reproach myself louisa i have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house by mere love and gratitude that what the head had left undone and could not do the heart may have been doing silently can it be so i am not too proud to believe it louisa how could i be arrogant and you before me can it be so is it so my dear
p00135_A,00135,A,outside this door sir
p00136_A,00136,A,if i do not understand and i do not sir what your honour as a gentleman binds you to in other matters i am sure i may rely upon it to keep my visit secret and to keep secret what i am going to say i will rely upon it if you will tell me i may so far trust
p00137_A,00137,A,you may i assure you
p00138_A,00138,A,i am quite sure that it is the only reparation in your power sir i am quite sure or i would not have come here
p00139_A,00139,A,i am only a poor girl i was separated from my father he was only a stroller and taken pity on by mr gradgrind i have lived in the house ever since
p00140_A,00140,A,my dear bounderby let me beg you to restrain these loud out breaks on all accounts louisa is here the moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak and whom i deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you louisa hurried here for protection i myself had not been at home many hours when i received her here in this room she hurried by the train to town she ran from town to this house through a raging storm and presented herself before me in a state of distraction of course she has remained here ever since let me entreat you for your own sake and for hers to be more quiet
p00141_A,00141,A,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00142_A,00142,A,well ma am without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family what i have got to add to that is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge namely a coach and the coach in which we came here being at the door you ll allow me to hand you down to it and pack you home to the bank where the best course for you to pursue will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed
p00143_A,00143,A,mrs bounderby i don t disturb you i hope this is an unseasonable hour but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary tom gradgrind as your son young tom refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements good or bad i am obliged to confront her with your daughter
p00144_A,00144,A,will you make it known young lady where and who was there
p00145_A,00145,A,i went to the house where stephen blackpool lodged on the night of his discharge from his work and i saw you there he was there too and an old woman who did not speak and whom i could scarcely see stood in a dark corner my brother was with me
p00146_A,00146,A,why couldn t you say so young tom
p00147_A,00147,A,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p00148_A,00148,A,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p00149_A,00149,A,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p00150_A,00150,A,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p00151_A,00151,A,did you offer him a bank note
p00152_A,00152,A,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p00153_A,00153,A,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p00154_A,00154,A,i am very very sorry
p00155_A,00155,A,oh young lady young lady i hope you may be but i don t know i can t say what you may ha done the like of you don t know us don t care for us don t belong to us i am not sure why you may ha come that night i can t tell but what you may ha come wi some aim of your own not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad i said then bless you for coming and i said it of my heart you seemed to take so pitifully to him but i don t know now i don t know and when i think that the poor lad was so grateful thinkin you so good to him when i mind that he put his hand over his hard worken face to hide the tears that you brought up there oh i hope you may be sorry and ha no bad cause to be it but i don t know i don t know
p00156_A,00156,A,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p00157_A,00157,A,oh by george he changes his name does he that s rather unlucky too for such an immaculate chap it s considered a little suspicious in courts of justice i believe when an innocent happens to have many names
p00158_A,00158,A,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p00159_A,00159,A,he shall not through any act of mine come back wi the unmerited reproach of being brought back he shall come back of his own accord to clear himself and put all those that have injured his good character and he not here for its defence to shame i have told him what has been done against him and he will be here at furthest in two days
p00160_A,00160,A,notwithstanding which if he can be laid hold of any sooner he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself as to you i have nothing against you what you came and told me turns out to be true and i have given you the means of proving it to be true and there s an end of it i wish you good night all i must be off to look a little further into this
p00161_A,00161,A,good night father
p00162_A,00162,A,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p00163_A,00163,A,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p00164_A,00164,A,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p00165_A,00165,A,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p00166_A,00166,A,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p00167_A,00167,A,then i will come next night too
p00168_A,00168,A,it s a coincidence it s a providence come out ma am come out or we ll have you dragged out leave her alone everybody let nobody touch her she belongs to me come in ma am come in ma am or we ll have you dragged in
p00169_A,00169,A,what did you let her bring you for couldn t you knock her cap off or her tooth out or scratch her or do something or other to her
p00170_A,00170,A,do you deny then madam that you left your son to to be brought up in the gutter
p00171_A,00171,A,josiah in the gutter no such a thing sir never for shame on you my dear boy knows and will give you to know that though he come of humble parents he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful and i ve his books at home to show it aye have i and my dear boy knows and will give you to know sir that after his beloved father died when he was eight years old his mother too could pinch a bit as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it to help him out in life and put him prentice and a steady lad he was and a kind master he had to lend him a hand and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving and i ll give you to know sir for this my dear boy won t that though his mother kept but a little village shop he never forgot her but pensioned me on thirty pound a year more than i want for i put by out of it only making the condition that i was to keep down in my own part and make no boasts about him and not trouble him and i never have except with looking at him once a year when he has never knowed it and it s right that i should keep down in my own part and i have no doubts that if i was here i should do a many unbefitting things and i am well contented and i can keep my pride in my josiah to myself and i can love for love s own sake and i am ashamed of you sir for your slanders and suspicions and i never stood here before nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no and i shouldn t be here now if it hadn t been for being brought here and for shame upon you oh for shame to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son with my son standing here to tell you so different
p00172_A,00172,A,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening

p00007_B,00007,B,and mrs gradgrind i should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry
p00008_B,00008,B,dear me how can you louisa and thomas i wonder at you i declare you re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all i have a great mind to say i wish i hadn t then what would you have done i should like to know as if with my head in its present throbbing state you couldn t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you instead of circuses you know as well as i do no young people have circus masters or keep circuses in cabinets or attend lectures about circuses what can you possibly want to know of circuses then i am sure you have enough to do if that s what you want with my head in its present state i couldn t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to
p00009_B,00009,B,that s the reason
p00010_B,00010,B,bounderby you are always so interested in my young people particularly in louisa that i make no apology for saying to you i am very much vexed by this discovery i have systematically devoted myself as you know to the education of the reason of my family the reason is as you know the only faculty to which education should be addressed and yet bounderby it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to day though in itself a trifling one as if something had crept into thomas s and louisa s minds which is or rather which is not i don t know that i can express myself better than by saying which has never been intended to be developed and in which their reason has no part
p00011_B,00011,B,there certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds when i was a vagabond myself nobody looked with any interest at me i know that
p00012_B,00012,B,oh my poor health the girl wanted to come to the school and mr gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school and louisa and thomas both said that the girl wanted to come and that mr gradgrind wanted girls to come and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact

p00014_B,00014,B,it s all right now louisa it s all right young thomas you won t do so any more i ll answer for it s being all over with father well louisa that s worth a kiss isn t it

p00045_B,00045,B,her father always had it in his head that she was to be taught the deuce and all of education how it got into his head i can t say i can only say that it never got out he has been picking up a bit of reading for her here and a bit of writing for her there and a bit of ciphering for her somewhere else these seven years when sissy got into the school here her father was as pleased as punch i couldn t altogether make out why myself as we were not stationary here being but comers and goers anywhere i suppose however he had this move in his mind he was always half cracked and then considered her provided for if you should happen to have looked in to night for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service it would be very fortunate and well timed very fortunate and well timed
p00046_B,00046,B,on the contrary i came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school and that she must not attend any more still if her father really has left her without any connivance on her part bounderby let me have a word with you
p00047_B,00047,B,no i say no i advise you not i say by no means

p00066_B,00066,B,at last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again and never did give any satisfaction now and that he was a shame and disgrace and i should have done better without him all along i said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart and presently he was quiet and i sat down by him and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there when i had no more left to tell he put his arms round my neck and kissed me a great many times then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used for the little hurt he had had and to get it at the best place which was at the other end of town from there and then after kissing me again he let me go when i had gone down stairs i turned back that i might be a little bit more company to him yet and looked in at the door and said father shook his head and said and i left him sitting by the fire then the thought must have come upon him poor poor father of going away to try something for my sake for when i came back he was gone

p00116_B,00116,B,come let s have none of your interruptions it s enough to be robbed while you re snoring because you re too comfortable without being put right with your four seven ones i didn t snore myself when i was your age let me tell you i hadn t victuals enough to snore and i didn t four seven one not if i knew it a hundred and fifty odd pound that sum of money young tom locked in his safe not a very strong safe but that s no matter now everything was left all right some time in the night while this young fellow snored mrs sparsit ma am you say you have heard him snore
p00117_B,00117,B,sir i cannot say that i have heard him precisely snore and therefore must not make that statement but on winter evenings when he has fallen asleep at his table i have heard him what i should prefer to describe as partially choke i have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in dutch clocks not that i would convey any imputation on his moral character far from it i have always considered bitzer a young man of the most upright principle and to that i beg to bear my testimony
p00118_B,00118,B,where is tom by the by
p00119_B,00119,B,assuredly sir you did in a highly impressive manner give him such an admonition
p00120_B,00120,B,suspicious certainly
p00121_B,00121,B,thank you very much sir but pray do not let my comfort be a consideration anything will do for me
p00122_B,00122,B,but it is my duty to remember that what i was i am no longer indeed if i could altogether cancel the remembrance that mr sparsit was a powler or that i myself am related to the scadgers family or if i could even revoke the fact and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions i would gladly do so i should think it under existing circumstances right to do so
p00123_B,00123,B,indeed you are very good sir wait for the simple mutton
p00124_B,00124,B,your health ma am
p00125_B,00125,B,tom have you anything to tell me if ever you loved me in your life and have anything concealed from every one besides tell it to me
p00126_B,00126,B,there stop where you are ma am stop where you are mrs bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble i believe
p00127_B,00127,B,don t say that sir because that is very unkind to mrs bounderby and to be unkind is not to be you sir
p00128_B,00128,B,of course it is of no moment why should it be of any importance to me
p00129_B,00129,B,my benefactor
p00130_B,00130,B,serve you right you noodle and i am glad of it
p00131_B,00131,B,bitzer present my compliments to young mr thomas and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup with a glass of india ale mr thomas these plain viands being on table i thought you might be tempted
p00132_B,00132,B,when was i brought to this room
p00133_B,00133,B,i am well assured of what you say father i know i have been your favourite child i know you have intended to make me happy i have never blamed you and i never shall
p00134_B,00134,B,why should you stay with me my sister will miss you you are everything to her
p00135_B,00135,B,to mr harthouse and you speak to him with the most confiding eyes i ever saw and the most earnest voice though so quiet i ever heard
p00136_B,00136,B,i am young as you see i am alone as you see in coming to you sir i have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope but that is very strong this is a very odd beginning i don t see where we are going
p00137_B,00137,B,i think you have already guessed whom i left just now
p00138_B,00138,B,if i were to do such a very ridiculous thing it could only be in the most inviolable confidence
p00139_B,00139,B,send my fellow here
p00140_B,00140,B,sir my nerves are at present too much shaken and my health is at present too much impaired in your service to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears
p00141_B,00141,B,now as you showed me in your face tom gradgrind that you wanted to speak to me here i am but i am not in a very agreeable state i tell you plainly not relishing this business even as it is and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be treated by his wife you have your opinion i dare say and i have mine i know if you mean to say anything to me to night that goes against this candid remark you had better let it alone
p00142_B,00142,B,my dear bounderby
p00143_B,00143,B,i have
p00144_B,00144,B,why couldn t you say so young tom
p00145_B,00145,B,i promised my sister i wouldn t and besides she tells her own story so precious well and so full that what business had i to take it out of her mouth
p00146_B,00146,B,say young lady if you please why in an evil hour you ever came to stephen s that night
p00147_B,00147,B,i felt compassion for him and i wished to know what he was going to do and wished to offer him assistance
p00148_B,00148,B,thank you ma am much flattered and obliged
p00149_B,00149,B,did you offer him a bank note
p00150_B,00150,B,yes but he refused it and would only take two pounds in gold
p00151_B,00151,B,oh certainly if you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not i am bound to say it s confirmed
p00152_B,00152,B,young lady stephen blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town and where else there have been a meeting to night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way stephen the honestest lad the truest lad the best
p00153_B,00153,B,i am very very sorry
p00154_B,00154,B,you re a pretty article to come here with these precious imputations you ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself and you would be by rights
p00155_B,00155,B,come you know what you have engaged to do you had better give your mind to that not this
p00156_B,00156,B,deed i am loath that any here should see me like this but i won t be seen so again young lady when i had read what s put in print of stephen and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you i went straight to the bank to say i knew where stephen was and to give a sure and certain promise that he should be here in two days i couldn t meet wi mr bounderby then and your brother sent me away and i tried to find you but you was not to be found and i went back to work soon as i come out of the mill to night i hastened to hear what was said of stephen for i know wi pride he will come back to shame it and then i went again to seek mr bounderby and i found him and i told him every word i knew and he believed no word i said and brought me here
p00157_B,00157,B,indeed indeed i pity him from my heart and i hope that he will clear himself
p00158_B,00158,B,all the surer i suppose for your refusing to tell where he is eh
p00159_B,00159,B,good night father
p00160_B,00160,B,rachael you will not distrust me one day when you know me better
p00161_B,00161,B,it goes against me to mistrust any one but when i am so mistrusted when we all are i cannot keep such things quite out of my mind i ask your pardon for having done you an injury i don t think what i said now yet i might come to think it again wi the poor lad so wronged
p00162_B,00162,B,did you tell him in your letter that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him because he had been seen about the bank at night he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back and would be ready
p00163_B,00163,B,yes dear but i can t guess what can have ever taken him there he never used to go there it was never in his way his way was the same as mine and not near it
p00164_B,00164,B,i doubt if he can be here till next day
p00165_B,00165,B,then i will come next night too
p00166_B,00166,B,louisa my dear i have never that i know of seen this man do you believe him to be implicated
p00167_B,00167,B,i think i have believed it father though with great difficulty i do not believe it now
p00168_B,00168,B,it s mrs pegler
p00169_B,00169,B,i am surprised madam that in your old age you have the face to claim mr bounderby for your son after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him
p00170_B,00170,B,i don t exactly know how i come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company but i don t inquire when they re quite satisfied perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse whether they re satisfied or not perhaps they ll be so good as to disperse i m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs i have not undertaken to do it and i m not a going to do it therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject will be disappointed particularly tom gradgrind and he can t know it too soon in reference to the bank robbery there has been a mistake made concerning my mother if there hadn t been over officiousness it wouldn t have been made and i hate over officiousness at all times whether or no good evening
p00171_B,00171,B,it is so still here rachael and the way is so untrodden that i think we must be the first who have been here all the summer and yet i don t know this has not been broken very long the wood is quite fresh where it gave way here are footsteps too o rachael

p00175_B,00175,B,i will hold thy hand and keep beside thee stephen all the way
p00176_B,00176,B,i believe father he will not come back to town to night
p00177_B,00177,B,not now my dears in the evening i am not able yet to morrow
p00178_B,00178,B,we had our fears before yesterday and when i saw you brought to the side of the litter last night and heard what passed being close to rachael all the time i went to him when no one saw and said to him he was in a tremble before i whispered to him and he started and trembled more then and said i thought of father s old circus i have not forgotten where mr sleary goes at this time of year and i read of him in a paper only the other day i told him to hurry there and tell his name and ask mr sleary to hide him till i came he said and i saw him shrink away among the people
