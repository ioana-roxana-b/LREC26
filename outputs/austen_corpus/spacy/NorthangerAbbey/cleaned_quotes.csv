Q41,but perhaps i keep no journal,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q42,perhaps you are not sitting in this room and i am not sitting by you these are points in which a doubt is equally possible not keep a journal how are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in bath without one how are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be unless noted down every evening in a journal how are your various dresses to be remembered and the particular state of your complexion and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities without having constant recourse to a journal my dear madam i am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female nature may have done something but i am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q43,i have sometimes thought whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen that is i should not think the superiority was always on our side,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q44,as far as i have had opportunity of judging it appears to me that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless except in three particulars,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q45,and what are they,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q46,a general deficiency of subject a total inattention to stops and a very frequent ignorance of grammar,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q47,upon my word i need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment you do not think too highly of us in that way,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q48,i should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men than that they sing better duets or draw better landscapes in every power of which taste is the foundation excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q49,my dear catherine do take this pin out of my sleeve i am afraid it has torn a hole already i shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q50,that is exactly what i should have guessed it madam,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q51,do you understand muslins sir,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q52,particularly well i always buy my own cravats and am allowed to be an excellent judge and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown i bought one for her the other day and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it i gave but five shillings a yard for it and a true indian muslin,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q53,men commonly take so little notice of those things i can never get mr allen to know one of my gowns from another you must be a great comfort to your sister sir,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q54,i hope i am madam,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q55,and pray sir what do you think of miss morland s gown,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q56,it is very pretty madam but i do not think it will wash well i am afraid it will fray,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q57,how can you be so,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q58,i am quite of your opinion sir and so i told miss morland when she bought it,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q59,but then you know madam muslin always turns to some account or other miss morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief or a cap or a cloak muslin can never be said to be wasted i have heard my sister say so forty times when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted or careless in cutting it to pieces,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q60,bath is a charming place sir there are so many good shops here we are sadly off in the country not but what we have very good shops in salisbury but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way mr allen says it is nine measured nine but i am sure it cannot be more than eight and it is such a fag i come back tired to death now here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes,Mrs. Allen,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q61,what are you thinking of so earnestly not of your partner i hope for by that shake of the head your meditations are not satisfactory,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q62,i was not thinking of anything,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q63,that is artful and deep to be sure but i had rather be told at once that you will not tell me,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q64,well then i will not,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']

Q83,scold them do you scold them for not admiring her,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q84,yes that i do there is nothing i would not do for those who are really my friends i have no notion of loving people by halves it is not my nature my attachments are always excessively strong i told captain hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night i would not dance with him unless he would allow miss andrews to be as beautiful as an angel the men think us incapable of real friendship you know and i am determined to show them the difference now if i were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you i should fire up in a moment but that is not at all likely for you are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q85,oh dear how can you say so,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q86,i know you very well you have so much animation which is exactly what miss andrews wants for i must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her oh i must tell you that just after we parted yesterday i saw a young man looking at you so earnestly i am sure he is in love with you,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q87,it is very true upon my honour but i see how it is you are indifferent to everybody s admiration except that of one gentleman who shall be nameless nay i cannot blame you,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q88,your feelings are easily understood where the heart is really attached i know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else everything is so insipid so uninteresting that does not relate to the beloved object i can perfectly comprehend your feelings,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q89,but you should not persuade me that i think so very much about mr tilney for perhaps i may never see him again,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q90,not see him again my dearest creature do not talk of it i am sure you would be miserable if you thought so,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q91,no indeed i should not i do not pretend to say that i was not very much pleased with him but while i have udolpho to read i feel as if nobody could make me miserable oh the dreadful black veil my dear isabella i am sure there must be laurentina s skeleton behind it,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q92,it is so odd to me that you should never have read udolpho before but i suppose mrs morland objects to novels,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q93,no she does not she very often reads sir charles grandison herself but new books do not fall in our way,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q94,sir charles grandison that is an amazing horrid book is it not i remember miss andrews could not get through the first volume,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q95,it is not like udolpho at all but yet i think it is very entertaining,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q96,do you indeed you surprise me i thought it had not been readable but my dearest catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight i am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you the men take notice of that sometimes you know,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']

Q99,are they well i never observed that they always behave very well to me,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q100,oh they give themselves such airs they are the most conceited creatures in the world and think themselves of so much importance by the by though i have thought of it a hundred times i have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man do you like them best dark or fair,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q101,i hardly know i never much thought about it something between both i think brown not fair and and not very dark,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q102,very well catherine that is exactly he i have not forgot your description of mr tilney a brown skin with dark eyes and rather dark hair well my taste is different i prefer light eyes and as to complexion do you know i like a sallow better than any other you must not betray me if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q103,betray you what do you mean,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q104,nay do not distress me i believe i have said too much let us drop the subject,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']

Q175,and i hope madam that mr allen will be obliged to like the place from finding it of service to him,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"

Q186,there now i knew how it would be you men have such restless curiosity talk of the curiosity of women indeed tis nothing but be satisfied for you are not to know anything at all of the matter,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q187,and is that likely to satisfy me do you think,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q188,well i declare i never knew anything like you what can it signify to you what we are talking of perhaps we are talking about you therefore i would advise you not to listen or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q189,i tell you mr morland i would not do such a thing for all the world how can you be so teasing only conceive my dear catherine what your brother wants me to do he wants me to dance with him again though i tell him that it is a most improper thing and entirely against the rules it would make us the talk of the place if we were not to change partners,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q190,upon my honour in these public assemblies it is as often done as not,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"

Q217,what a sweet girl she is i quite dote on her,Isabella Thorpe,['James Morland']
Q218,you will not be frightened miss morland if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off he will most likely give a plunge or two and perhaps take the rest for a minute but he will soon know his master he is full of spirits playful as can be but there is no vice in him,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q219,old allen is as rich as a jew is not he,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q220,old allen the man you are with,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q221,oh mr allen you mean yes i believe he is very rich,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q222,and no children at all,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q223,no not any,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q224,a famous thing for his next heirs he is your godfather is not he,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q225,my godfather no,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q226,but you are always very much with them,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q227,yes very much,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q228,aye that is what i meant he seems a good kind of old fellow enough and has lived very well in his time i dare say he is not gouty for nothing does he drink his bottle a day now,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q229,his bottle a day no why should you think of such a thing he is a very temperate man and you could not fancy him in liquor last night,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q230,lord help you you women are always thinking of men s being in liquor why you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle i am sure of this that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now it would be a famous good thing for us all,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q231,i cannot believe it,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q232,oh lord it would be the saving of thousands there is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be our foggy climate wants help,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q233,and yet i have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in oxford,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q234,oxford there is no drinking at oxford now i assure you nobody drinks there you would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost now for instance it was reckoned a remarkable thing at the last party in my rooms that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head it was looked upon as something out of the common way mine is famous good stuff to be sure you would not often meet with anything like it in oxford and that may account for it but this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q235,yes it does give a notion and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than i thought you did however i am sure james does not drink so much you do not really think mr thorpe that james s gig will break down,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q236,break down oh lord did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life there is not a sound piece of iron about it the wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body upon my soul you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch it is the most devilish little rickety business i ever beheld thank god we have got a better i would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q237,good heavens then pray let us turn back they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on do let us turn back mr thorpe stop and speak to my brother and tell him how very unsafe it is,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q238,unsafe oh lord what is there in that they will only get a roll if it does break down and there is plenty of dirt it will be excellent falling oh curse it the carriage is safe enough if a man knows how to drive it a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out lord bless you i would undertake for five pounds to drive it to york and back again without losing a nail,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q239,past three o clock,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q240,well my dear here you are and i hope you have had a pleasant airing,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q241,yes ma am i thank you we could not have had a nicer day,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q242,so mrs thorpe said she was vastly pleased at your all going,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q243,you have seen mrs thorpe then,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q244,yes i went to the pump room as soon as you were gone and there i met her and we had a great deal of talk together she says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning it is so uncommonly scarce,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q245,did you see anybody else of our acquaintance,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q246,yes we agreed to take a turn in the crescent and there we met mrs hughes and mr and miss tilney walking with her,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q247,did you indeed and did they speak to you,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q248,yes we walked along the crescent together for half an hour they seem very agreeable people miss tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin and i fancy by what i can learn that she always dresses very handsomely mrs hughes talked to me a great deal about the family,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q249,and what did she tell you of them,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q250,oh a vast deal indeed she hardly talked of anything else,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q251,did she tell you what part of gloucestershire they come from,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q252,yes she did but i cannot recollect now but they are very good kind of people and very rich mrs tilney was a miss drummond and she and mrs hughes were schoolfellows and miss drummond had a very large fortune and when she married her father gave her twenty thousand pounds and five hundred to buy wedding clothes mrs hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q253,and are mr and mrs tilney in bath,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q254,yes i fancy they are but i am not quite certain upon recollection however i have a notion they are both dead at least the mother is yes i am sure mrs tilney is dead because mrs hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that mr drummond gave his daughter on her wedding day and that miss tilney has got now for they were put by for her when her mother died,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q255,and is mr tilney my partner the only son,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q256,i cannot be quite positive about that my dear i have some idea he is but however he is a very fine young man mrs hughes says and likely to do very well,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q257,oh heavens my beloved catherine have i got you at last now mr morland i shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so i charge you not to expect it my sweetest catherine how have you been this long age but i need not ask you for you look delightfully you really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever you mischievous creature do you want to attract everybody i assure you my brother is quite in love with you already and as for mr tilney but that is a settled thing even your modesty cannot doubt his attachment now his coming back to bath makes it too plain oh what would not i give to see him i really am quite wild with impatience my mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world she saw him this morning you know you must introduce him to me is he in the house now look about for heaven s sake i assure you i can hardly exist till i see him,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q258,no he is not here i cannot see him anywhere,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q259,oh horrid am i never to be acquainted with him how do you like my gown i think it does not look amiss the sleeves were entirely my own thought do you know i get so immoderately sick of bath your brother and i were agreeing this morning that though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks we would not live here for millions we soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place really our opinions were so exactly the same it was quite ridiculous there was not a single point in which we differed i would not have had you by for the world you are such a sly thing i am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q260,no indeed i should not,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q261,oh yes you would indeed i know you better than you know yourself you would have told us that we seemed born for each other or some nonsense of that kind which would have distressed me beyond conception my cheeks would have been as red as your roses i would not have had you by for the world,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q262,indeed you do me injustice i would not have made so improper a remark upon any account and besides i am sure it would never have entered my head,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q263,how well your brother dances,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q264,henry yes he does dance very well,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q265,he must have thought it very odd to hear me say i was engaged the other evening when he saw me sitting down but i really had been engaged the whole day to mr thorpe you cannot think how surprised i was to see him again i felt so sure of his being quite gone away,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q266,when henry had the pleasure of seeing you before he was in bath but for a couple of days he came only to engage lodgings for us,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q267,that never occurred to me and of course not seeing him anywhere i thought he must be gone was not the young lady he danced with on monday a miss smith,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q268,yes an acquaintance of mrs hughes,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q269,i dare say she was very glad to dance do you think her pretty,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q270,not very,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q271,he never comes to the pump room i suppose,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q272,yes sometimes but he has rid out this morning with my father,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q273,i hope i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Mrs. Hughes']"
Q274,perhaps we yes i think we certainly shall,Eleanor Tilney,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mrs. Hughes']"
Q275,i am glad of it for we shall all be there,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Mrs. Hughes']"
Q276,do not be frightened my dear catherine but i am really going to dance with your brother again i declare positively it is quite shocking i tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself but you and john must keep us in countenance make haste my dear creature and come to us john is just walked off but he will be back in a moment,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q277,heyday miss morland what is the meaning of this i thought you and i were to dance together,John Thorpe,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q278,i wonder you should think so for you never asked me,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'John Thorpe']"
Q279,that is a good one by jove i asked you as soon as i came into the room and i was just going to ask you again but when i turned round you were gone this is a cursed shabby trick i only came for the sake of dancing with you and i firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since monday yes i remember i asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak and here have i been telling all my acquaintance that i was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room and when they see you standing up with somebody else they will quiz me famously,John Thorpe,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q280,oh no they will never think of me after such a description as that,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'John Thorpe']"
Q281,by heavens if they do not i will kick them out of the room for blockheads what chap have you there,John Thorpe,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q282,tilney hum i do not know him a good figure of a man well put together does he want a horse here is a friend of mine sam fletcher has got one to sell that would suit anybody a famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas i had fifty minds to buy it myself for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when i meet with one but it would not answer my purpose it would not do for the field i would give any money for a real good hunter i have three now the best that ever were backed i would not take eight hundred guineas for them fletcher and i mean to get a house in leicestershire against the next season it is so d uncomfortable living at an inn,John Thorpe,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q283,that gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer he has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me we have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one without injuring the rights of the other i consider a country dance as an emblem of marriage fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q284,but they are such very different things,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q285,that you think they cannot be compared together,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q286,to be sure not people that marry can never part but must go and keep house together people that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q287,and such is your definition of matrimony and dancing taken in that light certainly their resemblance is not striking but i think i could place them in such a view you will allow that in both man has the advantage of choice woman only the power of refusal that in both it is an engagement between man and woman formed for the advantage of each and that when once entered into they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution that it is their duty each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else you will allow all this,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q288,yes to be sure as you state it all this sounds very well but still they are so very different i cannot look upon them at all in the same light nor think the same duties belong to them,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q289,in one respect there certainly is a difference in marriage the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman the woman to make the home agreeable to the man he is to purvey and she is to smile but in dancing their duties are exactly changed the agreeableness the compliance are expected from him while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water that i suppose was the difference of duties which struck you as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q290,no indeed i never thought of that,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q291,then i am quite at a loss one thing however i must observe this disposition on your side is rather alarming you totally disallow any similarity in the obligations and may i not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish have i not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return or if any other gentleman were to address you there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q292,mr thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s that if he talks to me i must talk to him again but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that i have any acquaintance with,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q293,and is that to be my only security alas alas,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q294,nay i am sure you cannot have a better for if i do not know anybody it is impossible for me to talk to them and besides i do not want to talk to anybody,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q295,now you have given me a security worth having and i shall proceed with courage do you find bath as agreeable as when i had the honour of making the inquiry before,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q296,yes quite more so indeed,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q297,more so take care or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time you ought to be tired at the end of six weeks,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q298,i do not think i should be tired if i were to stay here six months,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q299,bath compared with london has little variety and so everybody finds out every year for six weeks i allow bath is pleasant enough but beyond that it is the most tiresome place in the world you would be told so by people of all descriptions who come regularly every winter lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q300,well other people must judge for themselves and those who go to london may think nothing of bath but i who live in a small retired village in the country can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home for here are a variety of amusements a variety of things to be seen and done all day long which i can know nothing of there,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q301,you are not fond of the country,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q302,yes i am i have always lived there and always been very happy but certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a bath life one day in the country is exactly like another,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q303,but then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q304,do i,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q305,do you not,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q306,i do not believe there is much difference,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q307,here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q308,and so i am at home only i do not find so much of it i walk about here and so i do there but here i see a variety of people in every street and there i can only go and call on mrs allen,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q309,only go and call on mrs allen what a picture of intellectual poverty however when you sink into this abyss again you will have more to say you will be able to talk of bath and of all that you did here,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q310,oh yes i shall never be in want of something to talk of again to mrs allen or anybody else i really believe i shall always be talking of bath when i am at home again i do like it so very much if i could but have papa and mamma and the rest of them here i suppose i should be too happy james s coming my eldest brother is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already oh who can ever be tired of bath,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q311,not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do but papas and mammas and brothers and intimate friends are a good deal gone by to most of the frequenters of bath and the honest relish of balls and plays and everyday sights is past with them,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q312,i see that you guess what i have just been asked that gentleman knows your name and you have a right to know his it is general tilney my father,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q313,oh,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q314,how handsome a family they are,Catherine Morland,[]
Q315,i shall like it beyond anything in the world and do not let us put it off let us go tomorrow,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q316,remember twelve o clock,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q317,oh dear i do believe it will be wet,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q318,i thought how it would be,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q319,no walk for me today but perhaps it may come to nothing or it may hold up before twelve,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q320,perhaps it may but then my dear it will be so dirty,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q321,oh that will not signify i never mind dirt,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q322,no i know you never mind dirt,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q323,it comes on faster and faster,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q324,so it does indeed if it keeps raining the streets will be very wet,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q325,there are four umbrellas up already how i hate the sight of an umbrella,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q326,they are disagreeable things to carry i would much rather take a chair at any time,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q327,it was such a nice looking morning i felt so convinced it would be dry,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q328,anybody would have thought so indeed there will be very few people in the pump room if it rains all the morning i hope mr allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes but i dare say he will not for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat i wonder he should dislike it it must be so comfortable,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q329,you will not be able to go my dear,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q330,i do not quite despair yet i shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve this is just the time of day for it to clear up and i do think it looks a little lighter there it is twenty minutes after twelve and now i shall give it up entirely oh that we had such weather here as they had at udolpho or at least in tuscany and the south of france the night that poor st aubin died such beautiful weather,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']
Q331,always thought it would clear up,Mrs. Allen,['Catherine Morland']
Q332,isabella my brother and mr thorpe i declare they are coming for me perhaps but i shall not go i cannot go indeed for you know miss tilney may still call,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Allen']

Q383,do not be so dull my dearest creature you will quite break my heart it was amazingly shocking to be sure but the tilneys were entirely to blame why were not they more punctual it was dirty indeed but what did that signify i am sure john and i should not have minded it i never mind going through anything where a friend is concerned that is my disposition and john is just the same he has amazing strong feelings good heavens what a delightful hand you have got kings i vow i never was so happy in my life i would fifty times rather you should have them than myself,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']

Q389,we were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in argyle street you were so kind as to look back on purpose,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q390,but indeed i did not wish you a pleasant walk i never thought of such a thing but i begged mr thorpe so earnestly to stop i called out to him as soon as ever i saw you now mrs allen did not oh you were not there but indeed i did and if mr thorpe would only have stopped i would have jumped out and run after you,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q391,oh do not say miss tilney was not angry because i know she was for she would not see me this morning when i called i saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it i was hurt but i was not affronted perhaps you did not know i had been there,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q392,i was not within at the time but i heard of it from eleanor and she has been wishing ever since to see you to explain the reason of such incivility but perhaps i can do it as well it was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out and he being hurried for time and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied that was all i do assure you she was very much vexed and meant to make her apology as soon as possible,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q393,but mr tilney why were you less generous than your sister if she felt such confidence in my good intentions and could suppose it to be only a mistake why should you be so ready to take offence,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q394,me i take offence,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q395,nay i am sure by your look when you came into the box you were angry,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q396,i angry i could have no right,Henry Tilney,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q397,well nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q398,how came mr thorpe to know your father,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q399,he is a fine old fellow upon my soul stout active looks as young as his son i have a great regard for him i assure you a gentleman like good sort of fellow as ever lived,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q400,but how came you to know him,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q401,know him there are few people much about town that i do not know i have met him forever at the bedford and i knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard room one of the best players we have by the by and we had a little touch together though i was almost afraid of him at first the odds were five to four against me and if i had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world i took his ball exactly but i could not make you understand it without a table however i did beat him a very fine fellow as rich as a jew i should like to dine with him i dare say he gives famous dinners but what do you think we have been talking of you yes by heavens and the general thinks you the finest girl in bath,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q402,oh nonsense how can you say so,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q403,and what do you think i said,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q404,well done general said i i am quite of your mind,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q405,do not urge me isabella i am engaged to miss tilney i cannot go,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q406,it would be so easy to tell miss tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement and must only beg to put off the walk till tuesday,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q407,no it would not be easy i could not do it there has been no prior engagement,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q408,i cannot help being jealous catherine when i see myself slighted for strangers i who love you so excessively when once my affections are placed it is not in the power of anything to change them but i believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s i am sure they are too strong for my own peace and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick i own these tilneys seem to swallow up everything else,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q409,nay catherine i think you cannot stand out any longer now the sacrifice is not much and to oblige such a friend i shall think you quite unkind if you still refuse,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q410,no no no,John Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q411,very well then there is an end of the party if catherine does not go i cannot i cannot be the only woman i would not upon any account in the world do so improper a thing,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q412,catherine you must go,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q413,but why cannot mr thorpe drive one of his other sisters i dare say either of them would like to go,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q414,thank ye but i did not come to bath to drive my sisters about and look like a fool no if you do not go d me if i do i only go for the sake of driving you,John Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q415,that is a compliment which gives me no pleasure,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q416,i did not think you had been so obstinate catherine you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q417,i hope i am not less so now but indeed i cannot go if i am wrong i am doing what i believe to be right,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q418,i suspect there is no great struggle,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q419,well i have settled the matter and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience i have been to miss tilney and made your excuses,John Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q420,you have not,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q421,i have upon my soul left her this moment told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till tuesday she said very well tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties a pretty good thought of mine hey,John Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q422,a most heavenly thought indeed now my sweet catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q423,this will not do i cannot submit to this i must run after miss tilney directly and set her right,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q424,i do not care mr thorpe had no business to invent any such message if i had thought it right to put it off i could have spoken to miss tilney myself this is only doing it in a ruder way and how do i know that mr thorpe has he may be mistaken again perhaps he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on friday let me go mr thorpe isabella do not hold me,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q425,then i will go after them wherever they are i will go after them it does not signify talking if i could not be persuaded into doing what i thought wrong i never will be tricked into it,Catherine Morland,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q426,let her go let her go if she will go,James Morland,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'John Thorpe']"
Q427,she is as obstinate as,John Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q428,i am come in a great hurry it was all a mistake i never promised to go i told them from the first i could not go i ran away in a great hurry to explain it i did not care what you thought of me i would not stay for the servant,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q429,well and do you think of going too,Mr. Allen,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q430,no i had just engaged myself to walk with miss tilney before they told me of it and therefore you know i could not go with them could i,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q431,no certainly not and i am glad you do not think of it these schemes are not at all the thing young men and women driving about the country in open carriages now and then it is very well but going to inns and public places together it is not right and i wonder mrs thorpe should allow it i am glad you do not think of going i am sure mrs morland would not be pleased mrs allen are not you of my way of thinking do not you think these kind of projects objectionable,Mr. Allen,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q432,yes very much so indeed open carriages are nasty things a clean gown is not five minutes wear in them you are splashed getting in and getting out and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction i hate an open carriage myself,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q433,i know you do but that is not the question do not you think it has an odd appearance if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men to whom they are not even related,Mr. Allen,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q434,yes my dear a very odd appearance indeed i cannot bear to see it,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q435,dear madam then why did not you tell me so before i am sure if i had known it to be improper i would not have gone with mr thorpe at all but i always hoped you would tell me if you thought i was doing wrong,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q436,and so i should my dear you may depend on it for as i told mrs morland at parting i would always do the best for you in my power but one must not be over particular young people will be young people as your good mother says herself you know i wanted you when we first came not to buy that sprigged muslin but you would young people do not like to be always thwarted,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q437,but this was something of real consequence and i do not think you would have found me hard to persuade,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q438,as far as it has gone hitherto there is no harm done and i would only advise you my dear not to go out with mr thorpe any more,Mr. Allen,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q439,that is just what i was going to say,Mrs. Allen,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q440,you had better leave her alone my dear she is old enough to know what she is about and if not has a mother to advise her mrs thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt but however you had better not interfere she and your brother choose to go and you will be only getting ill will,Mr. Allen,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q441,i never look at it without thinking of the south of france,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q442,you have been abroad then,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q443,oh no i only mean what i have read about it always puts me in mind of the country that emily and her father travelled through in the mysteries of udolpho but you never read novels i dare say,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q444,why not,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q445,because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q446,the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffe s works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q447,yes and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q448,thank you eleanor a most honourable testimony you see miss morland the injustice of your suspicions here was i in my eagerness to get on refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister breaking the promise i had made of reading it aloud and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part by running away with the volume which you are to observe was her own particularly her own i am proud when i reflect on it and i think it must establish me in your good opinion,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q449,i am very glad to hear it indeed and now i shall never be ashamed of liking udolpho myself but i really thought before young men despised novels amazingly,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q450,it is amazingly it may well suggest amazement if they do for they read nearly as many as women i myself have read hundreds and hundreds do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of julias and louisas if we proceed to particulars and engage in the never ceasing inquiry of have you read this and have you read that i shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall i say i want an appropriate simile as far as your friend emily herself left poor valancourt when she went with her aunt into italy consider how many years i have had the start of you i had entered on my studies at oxford while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q451,not very good i am afraid but now really do not you think udolpho the nicest book in the world,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q452,the nicest by which i suppose you mean the neatest that must depend upon the binding,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q453,henry you are very impertinent miss morland he is treating you exactly as he does his sister he is forever finding fault with me for some incorrectness of language and now he is taking the same liberty with you the word nicest as you used it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or we shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q454,i am sure i did not mean to say anything wrong but it is a nice book and why should not i call it so,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q455,very true and this is a very nice day and we are taking a very nice walk and you are two very nice young ladies oh it is a very nice word indeed it does for everything originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness propriety delicacy or refinement people were nice in their dress in their sentiments or their choice but now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q456,while in fact it ought only to be applied to you without any commendation at all you are more nice than wise come miss morland let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction while we praise udolpho in whatever terms we like best it is a most interesting work you are fond of that kind of reading,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q457,to say the truth i do not much like any other,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q458,indeed,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q459,that is i can read poetry and plays and things of that sort and do not dislike travels but history real solemn history i cannot be interested in can you,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q460,yes i am fond of history,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q461,i wish i were too i read it a little as a duty but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me the quarrels of popes and kings with wars or pestilences in every page the men all so good for nothing and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome and yet i often think it odd that it should be so dull for a great deal of it must be invention the speeches that are put into the heroes mouths their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention and invention is what delights me in other books,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q462,historians you think are not happy in their flights of fancy they display imagination without raising interest i am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true in the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records which may be as much depended on i conclude as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation and as for the little embellishments you speak of they are embellishments and i like them as such if a speech be well drawn up i read it with pleasure by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater if the production of mr hume or mr robertson than if the genuine words of caractacus agricola or alfred the great,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q463,you are fond of history and so are mr allen and my father and i have two brothers who do not dislike it so many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable at this rate i shall not pity the writers of history any longer if people like to read their books it is all very well but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes which as i used to think nobody would willingly ever look into to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls always struck me as a hard fate and though i know it is all very right and necessary i have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q464,that little boys and girls should be tormented is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny but in behalf of our most distinguished historians i must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim and that by their method and style they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life i use the verb to torment as i observed to be your own method instead of to instruct supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q465,you think me foolish to call instruction a torment but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it as i am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home you would allow that to torment and to instruct might sometimes be used as synonymous words,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q466,very probably but historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read and even you yourself who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe very intense application may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it consider if reading had not been taught mrs radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q467,i have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in london,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q468,indeed and of what nature,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q469,that i do not know nor who is the author i have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q470,good heaven where could you hear of such a thing,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q471,a particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from london yesterday it is to be uncommonly dreadful i shall expect murder and everything of the kind,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q472,you speak with astonishing composure but i hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated and if such a design is known beforehand proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q473,government neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters there must be murder and government cares not how much,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q474,come shall i make you understand each other or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can no i will be noble i will prove myself a man no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head i have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen perhaps they may want observation discernment judgment fire genius and wit,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q475,miss morland do not mind what he says but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q476,riot what riot,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q477,my dear eleanor the riot is only in your own brain the confusion there is scandalous miss morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out in three duodecimo volumes two hundred and seventy six pages in each with a frontispiece to the first of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand and you miss morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions you talked of expected horrors in london and instead of instantly conceiving as any rational creature would have done that such words could relate only to a circulating library she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in st george s fields the bank attacked the tower threatened the streets of london flowing with blood a detachment of the twelfth light dragoons the hopes of the nation called up from northampton to quell the insurgents and the gallant captain frederick tilney in the moment of charging at the head of his troop knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window forgive her stupidity the fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman but she is by no means a simpleton in general,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q478,and now henry that you have made us understand each other you may as well make miss morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister and a great brute in your opinion of women in general miss morland is not used to your odd ways,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q479,i shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q480,no doubt but that is no explanation of the present,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q481,what am i to do,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q482,you know what you ought to do clear your character handsomely before her tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q483,miss morland i think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom i happen to be in company,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q484,that is not enough be more serious,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q485,miss morland no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than i do in my opinion nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q486,we shall get nothing more serious from him now miss morland he is not in a sober mood but i do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all or an unkind one of me,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q487,they set off at eight this morning and i am sure i do not envy them their drive i think you and i are very well off to be out of the scrape it must be the dullest thing in the world for there is not a soul at clifton at this time of year belle went with your brother and john drove maria,Miss Anne,['Catherine Morland']
Q488,oh yes maria is gone she was quite wild to go she thought it would be something very fine i cannot say i admire her taste and for my part i was determined from the first not to go if they pressed me ever so much,Miss Anne,['Catherine Morland']
Q489,i wish you could have gone too it is a pity you could not all go,Catherine Morland,['Miss Anne']
Q490,thank you but it is quite a matter of indifference to me indeed i would not have gone on any account i was saying so to emily and sophia when you overtook us,Miss Anne,['Catherine Morland']
Q491,she will never forgive me i am sure but you know how could i help it john would have me go for he vowed he would not drive her because she had such thick ankles i dare say she will not be in good humour again this month but i am determined i will not be cross it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper,Maria Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q492,yes my dear catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you oh that arch eye of yours it sees through everything,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q493,nay my beloved sweetest friend compose yourself i am amazingly agitated as you perceive let us sit down and talk in comfort well and so you guessed it the moment you had my note sly creature oh my dear catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness your brother is the most charming of men i only wish i were more worthy of him but what will your excellent father and mother say oh heavens when i think of them i am so agitated,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q494,good heaven my dear isabella what do you mean can you can you really be in love with james,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q495,you will be so infinitely dearer to me my catherine than either anne or maria i feel that i shall be so much more attached to my dear morland s family than to my own,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q496,you are so like your dear brother that i quite doted on you the first moment i saw you but so it always is with me the first moment settles everything the very first day that morland came to us last christmas the very first moment i beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone i remember i wore my yellow gown with my hair done up in braids and when i came into the drawing room and john introduced him i thought i never saw anybody so handsome before,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q497,i remember too miss andrews drank tea with us that evening and wore her puce coloured sarsenet and she looked so heavenly that i thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her i could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it oh catherine the many sleepless nights i have had on your brother s account i would not have you suffer half what i have done i am grown wretchedly thin i know but i will not pain you by describing my anxiety you have seen enough of it i feel that i have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church but my secret i was always sure would be safe with you,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q498,it is impossible for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness i have no doubt of their consenting immediately,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q499,morland says exactly the same and yet i dare not expect it my fortune will be so small they never can consent to it your brother who might marry anybody,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q500,indeed isabella you are too humble the difference of fortune can be nothing to signify,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q501,oh my sweet catherine in your generous heart i know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many as for myself i am sure i only wish our situations were reversed had i the command of millions were i mistress of the whole world your brother would be my only choice,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q502,i am sure they will consent i am sure they will be delighted with you,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q503,for my own part my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me where people are really attached poverty itself is wealth grandeur i detest i would not settle in london for the universe a cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy there are some charming little villas about richmond,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q504,richmond you must settle near fullerton you must be near us,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q505,i am sure i shall be miserable if we do not if i can but be near you i shall be satisfied but this is idle talking i will not allow myself to think of such things till we have your father s answer morland says that by sending it tonight to salisbury we may have it tomorrow tomorrow i know i shall never have courage to open the letter i know it will be the death of me,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q506,indeed morland i must drive you away consider how far you have to ride i cannot bear to see you linger so for heaven s sake waste no more time there go go i insist on it,Isabella Thorpe,"['James Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q507,dear john dear catherine dear anne and dear maria,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Maria Thorpe', 'Isabella Thorpe', 'Miss Anne', 'John Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q508,well miss morland i am come to bid you good bye,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q509,shall not you be late at devizes,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q510,a famous good thing this marrying scheme upon my soul a clever fancy of morland s and belle s what do you think of it miss morland i say it is no bad notion,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q511,i am sure i think it a very good one,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q512,do you that s honest by heavens i am glad you are no enemy to matrimony however did you ever hear the old song going to one wedding brings on another i say you will come to belle s wedding i hope,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q513,yes i have promised your sister to be with her if possible,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q514,and then you know,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q515,i say then you know we may try the truth of this same old song,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q516,may we but i never sing well i wish you a good journey i dine with miss tilney today and must now be going home,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q517,nay but there is no such confounded hurry who knows when we may be together again not but that i shall be down again by the end of a fortnight and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q518,then why do you stay away so long,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q519,that is kind of you however kind and good natured i shall not forget it in a hurry but you have more good nature and all that than anybody living i believe a monstrous deal of good nature and it is not only good nature but you have so much so much of everything and then you have such upon my soul i do not know anybody like you,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q520,oh dear there are a great many people like me i dare say only a great deal better good morning to you,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q521,but i say miss morland i shall come and pay my respects at fullerton before it is long if not disagreeable,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q522,pray do my father and mother will be very glad to see you,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q523,and i hope i hope miss morland you will not be sorry to see me,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q524,oh dear not at all there are very few people i am sorry to see company is always cheerful,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q525,that is just my way of thinking give me but a little cheerful company let me only have the company of the people i love let me only be where i like and with whom i like and the devil take the rest say i and i am heartily glad to hear you say the same but i have a notion miss morland you and i think pretty much alike upon most matters,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q526,perhaps we may but it is more than i ever thought of and as to most matters to say the truth there are not many that i know my own mind about,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q527,by jove no more do i it is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me my notion of things is simple enough let me only have the girl i like say i with a comfortable house over my head and what care i for all the rest fortune is nothing i am sure of a good income of my own and if she had not a penny why so much the better,John Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q528,very true i think like you there if there is a good fortune on one side there can be no occasion for any on the other no matter which has it so that there is enough i hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another and to marry for money i think the wickedest thing in existence good day we shall be very glad to see you at fullerton whenever it is convenient,Catherine Morland,['John Thorpe']
Q529,but it was not so bad as that isabella there was no superciliousness she was very civil,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q530,oh don t defend her and then the brother he who had appeared so attached to you good heavens well some people s feelings are incomprehensible and so he hardly looked once at you the whole day,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q531,i do not say so but he did not seem in good spirits,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q532,how contemptible of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear catherine indeed he is unworthy of you,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q533,unworthy i do not suppose he ever thinks of me,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q534,that is exactly what i say he never thinks of you such fickleness oh how different to your brother and to mine i really believe john has the most constant heart,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q535,but as for general tilney i assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q536,oh i know no harm of him i do not suspect him of pride i believe he is a very gentleman like man john thinks very well of him and john s judgment,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q537,well i shall see how they behave to me this evening we shall meet them at the rooms,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q538,and must i go,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q539,do not you intend it i thought it was all settled,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q540,nay since you make such a point of it i can refuse you nothing but do not insist upon my being very agreeable for my heart you know will be some forty miles off and as for dancing do not mention it i beg that is quite out of the question charles hodges will plague me to death i dare say but i shall cut him very short ten to one but he guesses the reason and that is exactly what i want to avoid so i shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q541,your brother will not mind it i know because i heard him say before that he hated dancing but it was very good natured in him to think of it i suppose he saw isabella sitting down and fancied she might wish for a partner but he is quite mistaken for she would not dance upon any account in the world,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q542,how very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q543,why what do you mean,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q544,with you it is not how is such a one likely to be influenced what is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings age situation and probable habits of life considered but how should i be influenced what would be my inducement in acting so and so,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q545,i do not understand you,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q546,then we are on very unequal terms for i understand you perfectly well,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q547,me yes i cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q548,bravo an excellent satire on modern language,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q549,but pray tell me what you mean,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q550,shall i indeed do you really desire it but you are not aware of the consequences it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment and certainly bring on a disagreement between us,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q551,no no it shall not do either i am not afraid,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q552,well then i only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with miss thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q553,i cannot think how it could happen isabella was so determined not to dance,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q554,and did isabella never change her mind before,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q555,oh but because and your brother after what you told him from me how could he think of going to ask her,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q556,i cannot take surprise to myself on that head you bid me be surprised on your friend s account and therefore i am but as for my brother his conduct in the business i must own has been no more than i believed him perfectly equal to the fairness of your friend was an open attraction her firmness you know could only be understood by yourself,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q557,you are laughing but i assure you isabella is very firm in general,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q558,it is as much as should be said of anyone to be always firm must be to be often obstinate when properly to relax is the trial of judgment and without reference to my brother i really think miss thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q559,i do not wonder at your surprise and i am really fatigued to death he is such a rattle amusing enough if my mind had been disengaged but i would have given the world to sit still,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q560,then why did not you,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q561,oh my dear it would have looked so particular and you know how i abhor doing that i refused him as long as i possibly could but he would take no denial you have no idea how he pressed me i begged him to excuse me and get some other partner but no not he after aspiring to my hand there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of and it was not that he wanted merely to dance he wanted to be with me oh such nonsense i told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me for of all things in the world i hated fine speeches and compliments and so and so then i found there would be no peace if i did not stand up besides i thought mrs hughes who introduced him might take it ill if i did not and your dear brother i am sure he would have been miserable if i had sat down the whole evening i am so glad it is over my spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense and then being such a smart young fellow i saw every eye was upon us,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q562,he is very handsome indeed,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q563,handsome yes i suppose he may i dare say people would admire him in general but he is not at all in my style of beauty i hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man however he is very well amazingly conceited i am sure i took him down several times you know in my way,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q564,it is very charming indeed,Isabella Thorpe,"['Mrs. Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q565,mr morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed i only wish i could do as much one could not expect more from him you know if he finds he can do more by and by i dare say he will for i am sure he must be an excellent good hearted man four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed but your wishes my dear isabella are so moderate you do not consider how little you ever want my dear,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q566,it is not on my own account i wish for more but i cannot bear to be the means of injuring my dear morland making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life for myself it is nothing i never think of myself,Isabella Thorpe,"['Mrs. Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q567,i know you never do my dear and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you there never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and i dare say when mr morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear catherine by talking of such things mr morland has behaved so very handsome you know i always heard he was a most excellent man and you know my dear we are not to suppose but what if you had had a suitable fortune he would have come down with something more for i am sure he must be a most liberal minded man,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q568,nobody can think better of mr morland than i do i am sure but everybody has their failing you know and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money,Isabella Thorpe,"['Mrs. Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q569,i am very sure that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Thorpe', 'Isabella Thorpe']"
Q570,as to that my sweet catherine there cannot be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me it is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits i hate money and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year i should not have a wish unsatisfied ah my catherine you have found me out there s the sting the long long endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living,Isabella Thorpe,"['Mrs. Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q571,yes yes my darling isabella we perfectly see into your heart you have no disguise we perfectly understand the present vexation and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection,Mrs. Thorpe,"['Isabella Thorpe', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q572,by the end of another week,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q573,yes my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what i think a fair trial he has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here and as he is now pretty well is in a hurry to get home,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q574,i am very sorry for it if i had known this before,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q575,perhaps you would be so good it would make me very happy if,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q576,well eleanor may i congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q577,i was just beginning to make the request sir as you came in,Eleanor Tilney,"['General Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q578,well proceed by all means i know how much your heart is in it my daughter miss morland has been forming a very bold wish we leave bath as she has perhaps told you on saturday se nnight a letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the marquis of longtown and general courteney here some of my very old friends there is nothing to detain me longer in bath and could we carry our selfish point with you we should leave it without a single regret can you in short be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend eleanor with your company in gloucestershire i am almost ashamed to make the request though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in bath than yourself modesty such as yours but not for the world would i pain it by open praise if you can be induced to honour us with a visit you will make us happy beyond expression tis true we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour for our mode of living as you see is plain and unpretending yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make northanger abbey not wholly disagreeable,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q579,i will write home directly and if they do not object as i dare say they will not,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q580,since they can consent to part with you we may expect philosophy from all the world,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q581,this is my favourite place it is so out of the way,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q582,do not be uneasy isabella james will soon be here,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q583,psha my dear creature do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow it would be hideous to be always together we should be the jest of the place and so you are going to northanger i am amazingly glad of it it is one of the finest old places in england i understand i shall depend upon a most particular description of it,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q584,you shall certainly have the best in my power to give but who are you looking for are your sisters coming,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q585,i am not looking for anybody one s eyes must be somewhere and you know what a foolish trick i have of fixing mine when my thoughts are an hundred miles off i am amazingly absent i believe i am the most absent creature in the world tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q586,but i thought isabella you had something in particular to tell me,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q587,oh yes and so i have but here is a proof of what i was saying my poor head i had quite forgot it well the thing is this i have just had a letter from john you can guess the contents,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q588,no indeed i cannot,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q589,my sweet love do not be so abominably affected what can he write about but yourself you know he is over head and ears in love with you,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q590,with me dear isabella,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q591,nay my sweetest catherine this is being quite absurd modesty and all that is very well in its way but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming i have no idea of being so overstrained it is fishing for compliments his attentions were such as a child must have noticed and it was but half an hour before he left bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement he says so in this letter says that he as good as made you an offer and that you received his advances in the kindest way and now he wants me to urge his suit and say all manner of pretty things to you so it is in vain to affect ignorance,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q592,as to any attentions on his side i do declare upon my honour i never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming and as to making me an offer or anything like it there must be some unaccountable mistake i could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind you know and as i ever wish to be believed i solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us the last half hour before he went away it must be all and completely a mistake for i did not see him once that whole morning,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q593,but that you certainly did for you spent the whole morning in edgar s buildings it was the day your father s consent came and i am pretty sure that you and john were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q594,are you well if you say it it was so i dare say but for the life of me i cannot recollect it i do remember now being with you and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes however it is not worth arguing about for whatever might pass on his side you must be convinced by my having no recollection of it that i never thought nor expected nor wished for anything of the kind from him i am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side i never had the smallest idea of it pray undeceive him as soon as you can and tell him i beg his pardon that is i do not know what i ought to say but make him understand what i mean in the properest way i would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours isabella i am sure but you know very well that if i could think of one man more than another he is not the person,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q595,my dear friend you must not be angry with me i cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me and you know we shall still be sisters,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q596,yes yes,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q597,there are more ways than one of our being sisters but where am i wandering to well my dear catherine the case seems to be that you are determined against poor john is not it so,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q598,i certainly cannot return his affection and as certainly never meant to encourage it,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q599,since that is the case i am sure i shall not tease you any further john desired me to speak to you on the subject and therefore i have but i confess as soon as i read his letter i thought it a very foolish imprudent business and not likely to promote the good of either for what were you to live upon supposing you came together you have both of you something to be sure but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays and after all that romancers may say there is no doing without money i only wonder john could think of it he could not have received my last,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q600,you do acquit me then of anything wrong you are convinced that i never meant to deceive your brother never suspected him of liking me till this moment,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q601,oh as to that i do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been all that is best known to yourself a little harmless flirtation or so will occur and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by but you may be assured that i am the last person in the world to judge you severely all those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits what one means one day you know one may not mean the next circumstances change opinions alter,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q602,but my opinion of your brother never did alter it was always the same you are describing what never happened,Catherine Morland,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q603,my dearest catherine i would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about i do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother because he is my brother and who perhaps after all you know might be just as happy without you for people seldom know what they would be at young men especially they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant what i say is why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s you know i carry my notions of friendship pretty high but above all things my dear catherine do not be in a hurry take my word for it that if you are in too great a hurry you will certainly live to repent it tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections and i believe he is very right ah here he comes never mind he will not see us i am sure,Isabella Thorpe,['Catherine Morland']
Q604,what always to be watched in person or by proxy,Frederick Tilney ,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q605,psha nonsense why do you put such things into my head if i could believe it my spirit you know is pretty independent,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney ']
Q606,i wish your heart were independent that would be enough for me,Frederick Tilney ,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q607,my heart indeed what can you have to do with hearts you men have none of you any hearts,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney ']
Q608,if we have not hearts we have eyes and they give us torment enough,Frederick Tilney ,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q609,do they i am sorry for it i am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me i will look another way i hope this pleases you,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney ']
Q610,i hope your eyes are not tormented now,Isabella Thorpe,['Frederick Tilney ']
Q611,never more so for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little,Frederick Tilney ,['Isabella Thorpe']
Q612,my brother does know it,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q613,does he then why does he stay here,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q614,why do not you persuade him to go away the longer he stays the worse it will be for him at last pray advise him for his own sake and for everybody s sake to leave bath directly absence will in time make him comfortable again but he can have no hope here and it is only staying to be miserable,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q615,i am sure my brother would not wish to do that,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q616,then you will persuade him to go away,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q617,persuasion is not at command but pardon me if i cannot even endeavour to persuade him i have myself told him that miss thorpe is engaged he knows what he is about and must be his own master,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q618,no he does not know what he is about he does not know the pain he is giving my brother not that james has ever told me so but i am sure he is very uncomfortable,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q619,and are you sure it is my brother s doing,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q620,yes very sure,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q621,is it my brother s attentions to miss thorpe or miss thorpe s admission of them that gives the pain,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q622,is not it the same thing,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q623,i think mr morland would acknowledge a difference no man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves it is the woman only who can make it a torment,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q624,isabella is wrong but i am sure she cannot mean to torment for she is very much attached to my brother she has been in love with him ever since they first met and while my father s consent was uncertain she fretted herself almost into a fever you know she must be attached to him,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q625,i understand she is in love with james and flirts with frederick,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q626,oh no not flirts a woman in love with one man cannot flirt with another,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q627,it is probable that she will neither love so well nor flirt so well as she might do either singly the gentlemen must each give up a little,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q628,then you do not believe isabella so very much attached to my brother,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q629,i can have no opinion on that subject,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q630,but what can your brother mean if he knows her engagement what can he mean by his behaviour,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q631,you are a very close questioner,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q632,am i i only ask what i want to be told,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q633,but do you only ask what i can be expected to tell,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q634,yes i think so for you must know your brother s heart,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q635,my brother s heart as you term it on the present occasion i assure you i can only guess at,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q636,well,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q637,well nay if it is to be guesswork let us all guess for ourselves to be guided by second hand conjecture is pitiful the premises are before you my brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q638,well you may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but i am sure i cannot but is not your father uncomfortable about it does not he want captain tilney to go away sure if your father were to speak to him he would go,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q639,my dear miss morland in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort may you not be a little mistaken are you not carried a little too far would he thank you either on his own account or miss thorpe s for supposing that her affection or at least her good behaviour is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of captain tilney is he safe only in solitude or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else he cannot think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it i will not say do not be uneasy because i know that you are so at this moment but be as little uneasy as you can you have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend depend upon it therefore that real jealousy never can exist between them depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration their hearts are open to each other as neither heart can be to you they know exactly what is required and what can be borne and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q640,though frederick does not leave bath with us he will probably remain but a very short time perhaps only a few days behind us his leave of absence will soon expire and he must return to his regiment and what will then be their acquaintance the mess room will drink isabella thorpe for a fortnight and she will laugh with your brother over poor tilney s passion for a month,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q641,how glad i shall be when you are all off,Frederick Tilney ,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q642,but how can that be are not you with her,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q643,northanger is not more than half my home i have an establishment at my own house in woodston which is nearly twenty miles from my father s and some of my time is necessarily spent there,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q644,how sorry you must be for that,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q645,i am always sorry to leave eleanor,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q646,yes but besides your affection for her you must be so fond of the abbey after being used to such a home as the abbey an ordinary parsonage house must be very disagreeable,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q647,you have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q648,to be sure i have is not it a fine old place just like what one reads about,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q649,and are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce have you a stout heart nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q650,oh yes i do not think i should be easily frightened because there would be so many people in the house and besides it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years and then the family come back to it unawares without giving any notice as generally happens,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q651,no certainly we shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows doors or furniture but you must be aware that when a young lady is by whatever means introduced into a dwelling of this kind she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family while they snugly repair to their own end of the house she is formally conducted by dorothy the ancient housekeeper up a different staircase and along many gloomy passages into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before can you stand such a ceremony as this will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life and the bed of dark green stuff or purple velvet presenting even a funereal appearance will not your heart sink within you,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q652,oh but this will not happen to me i am sure,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q653,how fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment and what will you discern not tables toilettes wardrobes or drawers but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it dorothy meanwhile no less struck by your appearance gazes on you in great agitation and drops a few unintelligible hints to raise your spirits moreover she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call with this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when with fainting spirits you attempt to fasten your door you discover with increased alarm that it has no lock,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q654,oh mr tilney how frightful this is just like a book but it cannot really happen to me i am sure your housekeeper is not really dorothy well what then,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q655,nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night after surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed you will retire to rest and get a few hours unquiet slumber but on the second or at farthest the third night after your arrival you will probably have a violent storm peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it you will probably think you discern for your lamp is not extinguished one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it you will instantly arise and throwing your dressing gown around you proceed to examine this mystery after a very short search you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection and on opening it a door will immediately appear which door being only secured by massy bars and a padlock you will after a few efforts succeed in opening and with your lamp in your hand will pass through it into a small vaulted room,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q656,no indeed i should be too much frightened to do any such thing,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q657,what not when dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of st anthony scarcely two miles off could you shrink from so simple an adventure no no you will proceed into this small vaulted room and through this into several others without perceiving anything very remarkable in either in one perhaps there may be a dagger in another a few drops of blood and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture but there being nothing in all this out of the common way and your lamp being nearly exhausted you will return towards your own apartment in repassing through the small vaulted room however your eyes will be attracted towards a large old fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold which though narrowly examining the furniture before you had passed unnoticed impelled by an irresistible presentiment you will eagerly advance to it unlock its folding doors and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds at last however by touching a secret spring an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber but scarcely have you been able to decipher oh thou whomsoever thou mayst be into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket and leaves you in total darkness,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q658,oh no no do not say so well go on,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q659,that is a curious old chest is not it it is impossible to say how many generations it has been here how it came to be first put in this room i know not but i have not had it moved because i thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets the worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open in that corner however it is at least out of the way,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q660,no indeed,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q661,how much better is this how much better to find a fire ready lit than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed as so many poor girls have been obliged to do and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot how glad i am that northanger is what it is if it had been like some other places i do not know that in such a night as this i could have answered for my courage but now to be sure there is nothing to alarm one,Catherine Morland,[]
Q662,but we have a charming morning after it and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over what beautiful hyacinths i have just learnt to love a hyacinth,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q663,and how might you learn by accident or argument,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q664,your sister taught me i cannot tell how mrs allen used to take pains year after year to make me like them but i never could till i saw them the other day in milsom street i am naturally indifferent about flowers,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q665,but now you love a hyacinth so much the better you have gained a new source of enjoyment and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible besides a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex as a means of getting you out of doors and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take and though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic who can tell the sentiment once raised but you may in time come to love a rose,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q666,but i do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors the pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me and in fine weather i am out more than half my time mamma says i am never within,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q667,at any rate however i am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth the mere habit of learning to love is the thing and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q668,this is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude woodston will make but a sombre appearance today,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q669,is it a pretty place,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q670,what say you eleanor speak your opinion for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men i think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations the house stands among fine meadows facing the south east with an excellent kitchen garden in the same aspect the walls surrounding which i built and stocked myself about ten years ago for the benefit of my son it is a family living miss morland and the property in the place being chiefly my own you may believe i take care that it shall not be a bad one did henry s income depend solely on this living he would not be ill provided for perhaps it may seem odd that with only two younger children i should think any profession necessary for him and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business but though i may not exactly make converts of you young ladies i am sure your father miss morland would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment the money is nothing it is not an object but employment is the thing even frederick my eldest son you see who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county has his profession,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q671,i believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q672,no not at all mr allen did not care about the garden and never went into it,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q673,how were mr allen s succession houses worked,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q674,mr allen had only one small hot house which mrs allen had the use of for her plants in winter and there was a fire in it now and then,Catherine Morland,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q675,he is a happy man,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q676,but where are you going eleanor why do you choose that cold damp path to it miss morland will get wet our best way is across the park,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q677,this is so favourite a walk of mine that i always think it the best and nearest way but perhaps it may be damp,Eleanor Tilney,"['General Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q678,i am particularly fond of this spot it was my mother s favourite walk,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q679,i used to walk here so often with her though i never loved it then as i have loved it since at that time indeed i used to wonder at her choice but her memory endears it now,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q680,and ought it not to endear it to her husband yet the general would not enter it,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q681,her death must have been a great affliction,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q682,a great and increasing one i was only thirteen when it happened and though i felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it i did not i could not then know what a loss it was i have no sister you know and though henry though my brothers are very affectionate and henry is a great deal here which i am most thankful for it is impossible for me not to be often solitary,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q683,to be sure you must miss him very much,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q684,a mother would have been always present a mother would have been a constant friend her influence would have been beyond all other,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q685,was she a very charming woman was she handsome was there any picture of her in the abbey and why had she been so partial to that grove was it from dejection of spirits,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q686,her picture i suppose,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q687,hangs in your father s room,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q688,no it was intended for the drawing room but my father was dissatisfied with the painting and for some time it had no place soon after her death i obtained it for my own and hung it in my bed chamber where i shall be happy to show it you it is very like,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q689,our friends from fullerton,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q690,i was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q691,it remains as it was i suppose,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q692,yes entirely,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q693,and how long ago may it be that your mother died,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q694,she has been dead these nine years,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q695,you were with her i suppose to the last,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q696,no i was unfortunately from home her illness was sudden and short and before i arrived it was all over,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q697,my father often walks about the room in this way it is nothing unusual,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q698,i have many pamphlets to finish before i can close my eyes and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep can either of us be more meetly employed my eyes will be blinding for the good of others and yours preparing by rest for future mischief,General Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q699,eleanor,General Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q700,my father only wanted me to answer a note,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q701,mr tilney,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q702,good god how came you here how came you up that staircase,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q703,how came i up that staircase because it is my nearest way from the stable yard to my own chamber and why should i not come up it,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q704,and may i not in my turn ask how you came here this passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast parlour to your apartment as that staircase can be from the stables to mine,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q705,i have been to see your mother s room,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q706,my mother s room is there anything extraordinary to be seen there,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q707,no nothing at all i thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q708,i did not expect to be able to return sooner when i went away but three hours ago i had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me you look pale i am afraid i alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q709,no i was not you have had a very fine day for your ride,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q710,very and does eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q711,oh no she showed me over the greatest part on saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q712,your father was with us,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q713,and that prevented you have you looked into all the rooms in that passage,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q714,no i only wanted to see is not it very late i must go and dress,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q715,it is only a quarter past four,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q716,and you are not now in bath no theatre no rooms to prepare for half an hour at northanger must be enough,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q717,have you had any letter from bath since i saw you,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q718,no and i am very much surprised isabella promised so faithfully to write directly,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q719,promised so faithfully a faithful promise that puzzles me i have heard of a faithful performance but a faithful promise the fidelity of promising it is a power little worth knowing however since it can deceive and pain you my mother s room is very commodious is it not large and cheerful looking and the dressing closets so well disposed it always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house and i rather wonder that eleanor should not take it for her own she sent you to look at it i suppose,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q720,no,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q721,it has been your own doing entirely as there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by eleanor which does honour to her memory the world i believe never saw a better woman but it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this the domestic unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours eleanor i suppose has talked of her a great deal,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q722,yes a great deal that is no not much but what she did say was very interesting her dying so suddenly,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q723,and you none of you being at home and your father i thought perhaps had not been very fond of her,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q724,and from these circumstances you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some or it may be of something still less pardonable,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q725,my mother s illness the seizure which ended in her death was sudden the malady itself one from which she had often suffered a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional on the third day in short as soon as she could be prevailed on a physician attended her a very respectable man and one in whom she had always placed great confidence upon his opinion of her danger two others were called in the next day and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours on the fifth day she died during the progress of her disorder frederick and i we were both at home saw her repeatedly and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her or which her situation in life could command poor eleanor was absent and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q726,but your father was he afflicted,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q727,for a time greatly so you have erred in supposing him not attached to her he loved her i am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and i will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did his value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q728,i am very glad of it it would have been very shocking,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q729,if i understand you rightly you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from remember the country and the age in which we live remember that we are english that we are christians consult your own understanding your own sense of the probable your own observation of what is passing around you does our education prepare us for such atrocities do our laws connive at them could they be perpetrated without being known in a country like this where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies and where roads and newspapers lay everything open dearest miss morland what ideas have you been admitting,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q730,tis only from james however,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q731,no bad news from fullerton i hope mr and mrs morland your brothers and sisters i hope they are none of them ill,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q732,no i thank you,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q733,they are all very well my letter was from my brother at oxford,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q734,i do not think i shall ever wish for a letter again,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q735,i am sorry if i had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome i should have given it with very different feelings,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q736,it contained something worse than anybody could suppose poor james is so unhappy you will soon know why,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q737,to have so kind hearted so affectionate a sister must be a comfort to him under any distress,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q738,i have one favour to beg that if your brother should be coming here you will give me notice of it that i may go away,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q739,yes i am sure i should be very sorry to leave you so soon but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with captain tilney,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q740,how quick you are you have guessed it i declare and yet when we talked about it in bath you little thought of its ending so isabella no wonder now i have not heard from her isabella has deserted my brother and is to marry yours could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness and everything that is bad in the world,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q741,i hope so far as concerns my brother you are misinformed i hope he has not had any material share in bringing on mr morland s disappointment his marrying miss thorpe is not probable i think you must be deceived so far i am very sorry for mr morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy but my surprise would be greater at frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q742,it is very true however you shall read james s letter yourself stay there is one part,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q743,will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q744,no read it yourself i do not know what i was thinking of james only means to give me good advice,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q745,well if it is to be so i can only say that i am sorry for it frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected i do not envy his situation either as a lover or a son,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q746,her mother is a very good sort of woman,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q747,what was her father,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q748,a lawyer i believe they live at putney,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q749,are they a wealthy family,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q750,no not very i do not believe isabella has any fortune at all but that will not signify in your family your father is so very liberal he told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q751,but would it be to promote his happiness to enable him to marry such a girl she must be an unprincipled one or she could not have used your brother so and how strange an infatuation on frederick s side a girl who before his eyes is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man is not it inconceivable henry frederick too who always wore his heart so proudly who found no woman good enough to be loved,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q752,that is the most unpromising circumstance the strongest presumption against him when i think of his past declarations i give him up moreover i have too good an opinion of miss thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured it is all over with frederick indeed he is a deceased man defunct in understanding prepare for your sister in law eleanor and such a sister in law as you must delight in open candid artless guileless with affections strong but simple forming no pretensions and knowing no disguise,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q753,such a sister in law henry i should delight in,Eleanor Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q754,but perhaps though she has behaved so ill by our family she may behave better by yours now she has really got the man she likes she may be constant,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q755,indeed i am afraid she will i am afraid she will be very constant unless a baronet should come in her way that is frederick s only chance i will get the bath paper and look over the arrivals,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q756,you think it is all for ambition then and upon my word there are some things that seem very like it i cannot forget that when she first knew what my father would do for them she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more i never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q757,among all the great variety that you have known and studied,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q758,my own disappointment and loss in her is very great but as for poor james i suppose he will hardly ever recover it,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q759,your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present but we must not in our concern for his sufferings undervalue yours you feel i suppose that in losing isabella you lose half yourself you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy society is becoming irksome and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at bath the very idea of them without her is abhorrent you would not for instance now go to a ball for the world you feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve on whose regard you can place dependence or whose counsel in any difficulty you could rely on you feel all this,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q760,no i do not ought i to say the truth though i am hurt and grieved that i cannot still love her that i am never to hear from her perhaps never to see her again i do not feel so very very much afflicted as one would have thought,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q761,you feel as you always do what is most to the credit of human nature such feelings ought to be investigated that they may know themselves,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q762,no my father s hands need not be strengthened and frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled he must tell his own story,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q763,but he will tell only half of it,Catherine Morland,['Henry Tilney']
Q764,a quarter would be enough,Henry Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q765,and when do you think sir i may look forward to this pleasure i must be at woodston on monday to attend the parish meeting and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days,Henry Tilney,"['General Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q766,well well we will take our chance some one of those days there is no need to fix you are not to put yourself at all out of your way whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough i think i can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table let me see monday will be a busy day with you we will not come on monday and tuesday will be a busy one with me i expect my surveyor from brockham with his report in the morning and afterwards i cannot in decency fail attending the club i really could not face my acquaintance if i stayed away now for as i am known to be in the country it would be taken exceedingly amiss and it is a rule with me miss morland never to give offence to any of my neighbours if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it they are a set of very worthy men they have half a buck from northanger twice a year and i dine with them whenever i can tuesday therefore we may say is out of the question but on wednesday i think henry you may expect us and we shall be with you early that we may have time to look about us two hours and three quarters will carry us to woodston i suppose we shall be in the carriage by ten so about a quarter before one on wednesday you may look for us,General Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q767,i am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured witness myself at this present hour because i am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at woodston on wednesday which bad weather or twenty other causes may prevent i must go away directly two days before i intended it,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q768,go away and why,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q769,why how can you ask the question because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits because i must go and prepare a dinner for you to be sure,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q770,oh not seriously,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q771,aye and sadly too for i had much rather stay,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q772,but how can you think of such a thing after what the general said when he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble because anything would do,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q773,i am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine you must know it to be so and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary besides if he had not said half so much as he did he has always such an excellent dinner at home that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q774,i wish i could reason like you for his sake and my own good bye as tomorrow is sunday eleanor i shall not return,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q775,we are not calling it a good house we are not comparing it with fullerton and northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage small and confined we allow but decent perhaps and habitable and altogether not inferior to the generality or in other words i believe there are few country parsonages in england half so good it may admit of improvement however far be it from me to say otherwise and anything in reason a bow thrown out perhaps though between ourselves if there is one thing more than another my aversion it is a patched on bow,General Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q776,oh why do not you fit up this room mr tilney what a pity not to have it fitted up it is the prettiest room i ever saw it is the prettiest room in the world,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q777,i trust that it will very speedily be furnished it waits only for a lady s taste,General Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q778,well if it was my house i should never sit anywhere else oh what a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees too it is the prettiest cottage,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'General Tilney']"
Q779,you like it you approve it as an object it is enough henry remember that robinson is spoken to about it the cottage remains,General Tilney,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q780,so much for isabella and for all our intimacy she must think me an idiot or she could not have written so but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her i see what she has been about she is a vain coquette and her tricks have not answered i do not believe she had ever any regard either for james or for me and i wish i had never known her,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q781,it will soon be as if you never had,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q782,there is but one thing that i cannot understand i see that she has had designs on captain tilney which have not succeeded but i do not understand what captain tilney has been about all this time why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother and then fly off himself,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q783,i have very little to say for frederick s motives such as i believe them to have been he has his vanities as well as miss thorpe and the chief difference is that having a stronger head they have not yet injured himself if the effect of his behaviour does not justify him with you we had better not seek after the cause,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q784,then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q785,i am persuaded that he never did,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q786,and only made believe to do so for mischief s sake,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q787,well then i must say that i do not like him at all though it has turned out so well for us i do not like him at all as it happens there is no great harm done because i do not think isabella has any heart to lose but suppose he had made her very much in love with him,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q788,but we must first suppose isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature and in that case she would have met with very different treatment,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q789,it is very right that you should stand by your brother,Catherine Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Eleanor Tilney']"
Q790,and if you would stand by yours you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of miss thorpe but your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality or a desire of revenge,Henry Tilney,"['Eleanor Tilney', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q791,nay if you can use such a word i can urge you no farther if you think it long,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q792,oh no i do not indeed for my own pleasure i could stay with you as long again,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q793,good heaven what can be the matter,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q794,my dear catherine you must not you must not indeed i am quite well this kindness distracts me i cannot bear it i come to you on such an errand,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q795,errand to me,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q796,how shall i tell you oh how shall i tell you,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q797,tis a messenger from woodston,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q798,you are mistaken indeed it is no one from woodston it is my father himself,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q799,you are too good i am sure to think the worse of me for the part i am obliged to perform i am indeed a most unwilling messenger after what has so lately passed so lately been settled between us how joyfully how thankfully on my side as to your continuing here as i hoped for many many weeks longer how can i tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by but i must not trust myself with words my dear catherine we are to part my father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on monday we are going to lord longtown s near hereford for a fortnight explanation and apology are equally impossible i cannot attempt either,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q800,my dear eleanor do not be so distressed a second engagement must give way to a first i am very very sorry we are to part so soon and so suddenly too but i am not offended indeed i am not i can finish my visit here you know at any time or i hope you will come to me can you when you return from this lord s come to fullerton,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q801,it will not be in my power catherine,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q802,come when you can then,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q803,monday so soon as monday and you all go well i am certain of i shall be able to take leave however i need not go till just before you do you know do not be distressed eleanor i can go on monday very well my father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence the general will send a servant with me i dare say half the way and then i shall soon be at salisbury and then i am only nine miles from home,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q804,ah catherine were it settled so it would be somewhat less intolerable though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought but how can i tell you tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us and not even the hour is left to your choice the very carriage is ordered and will be here at seven o clock and no servant will be offered you,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q805,i could hardly believe my senses when i heard it and no displeasure no resentment that you can feel at this moment however justly great can be more than i myself but i must not talk of what i felt oh that i could suggest anything in extenuation good god what will your father and mother say after courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home to have you driven out of the house without the considerations even of decent civility dear dear catherine in being the bearer of such a message i seem guilty myself of all its insult yet i trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that i am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q806,have i offended the general,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q807,alas for my feelings as a daughter all that i know all that i answer for is that you can have given him no just cause of offence he certainly is greatly very greatly discomposed i have seldom seen him more so his temper is not happy and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree some disappointment some vexation which just at this moment seems important but which i can hardly suppose you to have any concern in for how is it possible,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q808,i am sure i am very sorry if i have offended him it was the last thing i would willingly have done but do not be unhappy eleanor an engagement you know must be kept i am only sorry it was not recollected sooner that i might have written home but it is of very little consequence,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q809,i hope i earnestly hope that to your real safety it will be of none but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence to comfort appearance propriety to your family to the world were your friends the allens still in bath you might go to them with comparative ease a few hours would take you there but a journey of seventy miles to be taken post by you at your age alone unattended,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q810,oh the journey is nothing do not think about that and if we are to part a few hours sooner or later you know makes no difference i can be ready by seven let me be called in time,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q811,i shall see you in the morning,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q812,you must write to me catherine you must let me hear from you as soon as possible till i know you to be safe at home i shall not have an hour s comfort for one letter at all risks all hazards i must entreat let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at fullerton and have found your family well and then till i can ask for your correspondence as i ought to do i will not expect more direct to me at lord longtown s and i must ask it under cover to alice,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q813,no eleanor if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me i am sure i had better not write there can be no doubt of my getting home safe,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q814,i cannot wonder at your feelings i will not importune you i will trust to your own kindness of heart when i am at a distance from you,Eleanor Tilney,['Catherine Morland']
Q815,oh eleanor i will write to you indeed,Catherine Morland,['Eleanor Tilney']
Q816,my dear you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble depend upon it it is something not at all worth understanding,Mrs. Morland,"['Sarah', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q817,i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement but why not do it civilly,Sarah,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q818,i am sorry for the young people they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney,Mrs. Morland,"['Sarah', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q819,well i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets,Mrs. Morland,"['Sarah', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q820,this has been a strange acquaintance soon made and soon ended i am sorry it happens so for mrs allen thought them very pretty kind of young people and you were sadly out of luck too in your isabella ah poor james well we must live and learn and the next new friends you make i hope will be better worth keeping,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q821,no friend can be better worth keeping than eleanor,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland']
Q822,if so my dear i dare say you will meet again some time or other do not be uneasy it is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years and then what a pleasure it will be,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q823,we are sorry for him but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with and who was so entirely without fortune and now after such behaviour we cannot think at all well of her just at present it comes hard to poor james but that will not last forever and i dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life for the foolishness of his first choice,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q824,catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening she travelled all the way post by herself and knew nothing of coming till saturday night for general tilney from some odd fancy or other all of a sudden grew tired of having her there and almost turned her out of the house very unfriendly certainly and he must be a very odd man but we are so glad to have her amongst us again and it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature but can shift very well for herself,Mrs. Morland,"['Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen', 'Mrs. Allen']"
Q825,i really have not patience with the general,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland', 'Mr. Allen']"
Q826,i really have not patience with the general,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q827,only think my dear of my having got that frightful great rent in my best mechlin so charmingly mended before i left bath that one can hardly see where it was i must show it you some day or other bath is a nice place catherine after all i assure you i did not above half like coming away mrs thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us was not it you know you and i were quite forlorn at first,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q828,yes but that did not last long,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mrs. Morland']"
Q829,very true we soon met with mrs thorpe and then we wanted for nothing my dear do not you think these silk gloves wear very well i put them on new the first time of our going to the lower rooms you know and i have worn them a great deal since do you remember that evening,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q830,do i oh perfectly,Catherine Morland,"['Mrs. Allen', 'Mrs. Morland']"
Q831,it was very agreeable was not it mr tilney drank tea with us and i always thought him a great addition he is so very agreeable i have a notion you danced with him but am not quite sure i remember i had my favourite gown on,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q832,i really have not patience with the general such an agreeable worthy man as he seemed to be i do not suppose mrs morland you ever saw a better bred man in your life his lodgings were taken the very day after he left them catherine but no wonder milsom street you know,Mrs. Allen,"['Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q833,my dear catherine i am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady i do not know when poor richard s cravats would be done if he had no friend but you your head runs too much upon bath but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays and a time for work you have had a long run of amusement and now you must try to be useful,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q834,her head did not run upon bath much,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland']
Q835,then you are fretting about general tilney and that is very simple of you for ten to one whether you ever see him again you should never fret about trifles,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q836,i hope my catherine you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as northanger that would be turning your visit into an evil indeed wherever you are you should always be contented but especially at home because there you must spend the most of your time i did not quite like at breakfast to hear you talk so much about the french bread at northanger,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q837,i am sure i do not care about the bread it is all the same to me what i eat,Catherine Morland,['Mrs. Morland']
Q838,there is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance the mirror i think i will look it out for you some day or other because i am sure it will do you good,Mrs. Morland,['Catherine Morland']
Q839,you may see the house from this window sir,Sarah,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mrs. Morland', 'Catherine Morland']"
Q840,catherine would make a sad heedless young housekeeper to be sure,Mrs. Morland,"['Henry Tilney', 'Mr. Morland']"
Q841,your ladyship,General Tilney,['Eleanor Tilney']
