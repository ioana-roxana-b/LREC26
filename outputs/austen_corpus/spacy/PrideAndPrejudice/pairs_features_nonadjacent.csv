A Young Lucas,Charlotte Lucas,if i were as rich as mr darcy i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day,it may perhaps be pleasant to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on,2,11,1,1,4,15,1,1,4,10,1,1,1,16,1,1,0,14,0,1,1,3,1,1,4,17,1,1,2,19,1,1,0,0,0,0,31,155,84,86,Charlotte Lucas; Elizabeth; Jane; Kitty; Lydia; Maria; Mary; Mrs. Bennet,M,minor,F,intermediate

Mr. Bingley,Elizabeth,nay this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies,you have only proved by this that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself,4,0,1,0,4,3,1,1,3,1,1,1,5,3,1,1,4,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,6,1,1,7,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,60,29,246,248,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,intermediate,F,major
Mr. Darcy,Mr. Bingley,i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month,i am exceedingly gratified by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could,2,6,1,1,11,7,1,1,7,5,1,1,5,4,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,13,11,1,1,6,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,76,67,247,249,Elizabeth; Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,M,major,M,intermediate
Elizabeth,Mr. Darcy,would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it,you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,5,1,1,0,1,0,1,3,12,1,1,5,7,1,1,0,0,0,0,21,68,250,252,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,major

Elizabeth,Mr. Bingley,you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it,by all means let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do,10,5,1,1,7,6,1,1,8,8,1,1,8,3,1,1,5,5,1,1,1,4,1,1,11,12,1,1,21,10,1,1,1,1,1,1,121,94,255,257,Miss Bingley; Mr. Bingley; Mr. Darcy; Mr. Hurst; Mrs. Hurst,F,major,M,intermediate
